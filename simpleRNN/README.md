# RNN Models for text prediction

## rnn_words
Implementation of RNN using Tensorflow.
Run using rnn_train.py without the -s argument.
Can train on any text dataset.
## rnn_words_seq2seq
Implementation of a sequence to sequence RNN using Tensorflow.
Run using rnn_train.py with the -s argument.
Can only train correctly on datasets where sentences are split line-by-line.
