Folk lore , legends , myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages , for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic , marvelous and manifestly unreal STOP The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations STOP Yet the old-time fairy tale , having served for generations , may now be classed as `` historical '' in the children 's library ; for the time has come for a series of newer `` wonder tales '' in which the stereotyped genie , dwarf and fairy are eliminated , together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incident devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale STOP Modern education includes morality ; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder-tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident STOP [ Illustration ] Having this thought in mind , the story of `` The Wonderful Wizard of Oz '' was written solely to pleasure children of today STOP It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale , in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heart-aches and nightmares are left out STOP L. FRANK BAUM STOP Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies , with Uncle Henry , who was a farmer , and Aunt Em , who was the farmer 's wife STOP Their house was small , for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles STOP There were four walls , a floor and a roof , which made one room ; and this room contained a rusty looking cooking stove , a cupboard for the dishes , a table , three or four chairs , and the beds STOP Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner , and Dorothy a little bed in another corner STOP There was no garret at all , and no cellar -- except a small hole , dug in the ground , called a cyclone cellar , where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose , mighty enough to crush any building in its path STOP It was reached by a trap-door in the middle of the floor , from which a ladder led down into the small , dark hole STOP When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around , she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side STOP Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached the edge of the sky in all directions STOP The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass , with little cracks running through it STOP Even the grass was not green , for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere STOP Once the house had been painted , but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away , and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else STOP [ Illustration : `` _She caught Toto by the ear._ '' ] When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young , pretty wife STOP The sun and wind had changed her , too STOP They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray ; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips , and they were gray also STOP She was thin and gaunt , and never smiled , now STOP When Dorothy , who was an orphan , first came to her , Aunt Em had been so startled by the child 's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears ; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at STOP Uncle Henry never laughed STOP He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was STOP He was gray also , from his long beard to his rough boots , and he looked stern and solemn , and rarely spoke STOP It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh , and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings STOP Toto was not gray ; he was a little black dog , with long , silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny , wee nose STOP Toto played all day long , and Dorothy played with him , and loved him dearly STOP [ Illustration ] To-day , however , they were not playing STOP Uncle Henry sat upon the door-step and looked anxiously at the sky , which was even grayer than usual STOP Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms , and looked at the sky too STOP Aunt Em was washing the dishes STOP From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind , and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm STOP There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south , and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also STOP Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up STOP `` There 's a cyclone coming , Em , '' he called to his wife ; `` I 'll go look after the stock . STOP Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept STOP Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door STOP One glance told her of the danger close at hand STOP `` Quick , Dorothy ! STOP she screamed ; `` run for the cellar ! STOP Toto jumped out of Dorothy 's arms and hid under the bed , and the girl started to get him STOP Aunt Em , badly frightened , threw open the trap-door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small , dark hole STOP Dorothy caught Toto at last , and started to follow her aunt STOP When she was half way across the room there came a great shriek from the wind , and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor STOP A strange thing then happened STOP The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air STOP Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon STOP The north and south winds met where the house stood , and made it the exact center of the cyclone STOP In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still , but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher , until it was at the very top of the cyclone ; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather STOP It was very dark , and the wind howled horribly around her , but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily STOP After the first few whirls around , and one other time when the house tipped badly , she felt as if she were being rocked gently , like a baby in a cradle STOP Toto did not like it STOP He ran about the room , now here , now there , barking loudly ; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen STOP Once Toto got too near the open trap-door , and fell in ; and at first the little girl thought she had lost him STOP But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole , for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall STOP She crept to the hole , caught Toto by the ear , and dragged him into the room again ; afterward closing the trap-door so that no more accidents could happen STOP Hour after hour passed away , and slowly Dorothy got over her fright ; but she felt quite lonely , and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf STOP At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again ; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened , she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring STOP At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed , and lay down upon it ; and Toto followed and lay down beside her STOP In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind , Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep STOP [ Illustration ] STOP The Council with The Munchkins STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] She was awakened by a shock , so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt STOP As it was , the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened ; and Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally STOP Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving ; nor was it dark , for the bright sunshine came in at the window , flooding the little room STOP She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door STOP The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her , her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw STOP The cyclone had set the house down , very gently -- for a cyclone -- in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty STOP There were lovely patches of green sward all about , with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits STOP Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand , and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes STOP A little way off was a small brook , rushing and sparkling along between green banks , and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry , gray prairies STOP While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights , she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen STOP They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to ; but neither were they very small STOP In fact , they seemed about as tall as Dorothy , who was a well-grown child for her age , although they were , so far as looks go , many years older STOP [ Illustration : `` _I am the Witch of the North._ '' ] Three were men and one a woman , and all were oddly dressed STOP They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads , with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved STOP The hats of the men were blue ; the little woman 's hat was white , and she wore a white gown that hung in plaits from her shoulders ; over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds STOP The men were dressed in blue , of the same shade as their hats , and wore well polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops STOP The men , Dorothy thought , were about as old as Uncle Henry , for two of them had beards STOP But the little woman was doubtless much older : her face was covered with wrinkles , her hair was nearly white , and she walked rather stiffly STOP When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the doorway , they paused and whispered among themselves , as if afraid to come farther STOP But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy , made a low bow and said , in a sweet voice , '' You are welcome , most noble Sorceress , to the land of the Munchkins STOP We are so grateful to you for having killed the wicked Witch of the East , and for setting our people free from bondage . STOP [ Illustration ] Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder STOP What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress , and saying she had killed the wicked Witch of the East STOP Dorothy was an innocent , harmless little girl , who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home ; and she had never killed anything in all her life STOP But the little woman evidently expected her to answer ; so Dorothy said , with hesitation , '' You are very kind ; but there must be some mistake STOP I have not killed anything . STOP `` Your house did , anyway , '' replied the little old woman , with a laugh ; '' and that is the same thing STOP See ! STOP she continued , pointing to the corner of the house ; `` there are her two toes , still sticking out from under a block of wood . STOP Dorothy looked , and gave a little cry of fright STOP There , indeed , just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on , two feet were sticking out , shod in silver shoes with pointed toes STOP `` Oh , dear STOP oh , dear ! STOP cried Dorothy , clasping her hands together in dismay ; `` the house must have fallen on her STOP What ever shall we do ? STOP `` There is nothing to be done , '' said the little woman , calmly STOP [ Illustration ] '' But who was she ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` She was the wicked Witch of the East , as I said , '' answered the little woman STOP `` She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years , making them slave for her night and day STOP Now they are all set free , and are grateful to you for the favour . STOP `` Who are the Munchkins ? STOP enquired Dorothy STOP `` They are the people who live in this land of the East , where the wicked Witch ruled . STOP `` Are you a Munchkin ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` No ; but I am their friend , although I live in the land of the North STOP When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift messenger to me , and I came at once STOP I am the Witch of the North . STOP `` Oh , gracious ! STOP cried Dorothy ; `` are you a real witch ? STOP `` Yes , indeed ; '' answered the little woman STOP `` But I am a good witch , and the people love me STOP I am not as powerful as the wicked Witch was who ruled here , or I should have set the people free myself . STOP `` But I thought all witches were wicked , '' said the girl , who was half frightened at facing a real witch STOP `` Oh , no ; that is a great mistake STOP There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz , and two of them , those who live in the North and the South , are good witches STOP I know this is true , for I am one of them myself , and can not be mistaken STOP Those who dwelt in the East and the West were , indeed , wicked witches ; but now that you have killed one of them , there is but one wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz -- the one who lives in the West . STOP `` But , '' said Dorothy , after a moment 's thought , `` Aunt Em has told me that the witches were all dead -- years and years ago . STOP `` Who is Aunt Em ? STOP inquired the little old woman STOP `` She is my aunt who lives in Kansas , where I came from . STOP The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time , with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground STOP Then she looked up and said , '' I do not know where Kansas is , for I have never heard that country mentioned before STOP But tell me , is it a civilized country ? STOP `` Oh , yes ; '' replied Dorothy STOP `` Then that accounts for it STOP In the civilized countries I believe there are no witches left ; nor wizards , nor sorceresses , nor magicians STOP But , you see , the Land of Oz has never been civilized , for we are cut off from all the rest of the world STOP Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us . STOP `` Who are the Wizards ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` Oz himself is the Great Wizard , '' answered the Witch , sinking her voice to a whisper STOP `` He is more powerful than all the rest of us together STOP He lives in the City of Emeralds . STOP Dorothy was going to ask another question , but just then the Munchkins , who had been standing silently by , gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying STOP [ Illustration ] '' What is it ? STOP asked the little old woman ; and looked , and began to laugh STOP The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely and nothing was left but the silver shoes STOP `` She was so old , '' explained the Witch of the North , `` that she dried up quickly in the sun STOP That is the end of her STOP But the silver shoes are yours , and you shall have them to wear . STOP She reached down and picked up the shoes , and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy STOP `` The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes , '' said one of the Munchkins ; `` and there is some charm connected with them ; but what it is we never knew . STOP Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table STOP Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said , '' I am anxious to get back to my Aunt and Uncle , for I am sure they will worry about me STOP Can you help me find my way ? STOP The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another , and then at Dorothy , and then shook their heads STOP `` At the East , not far from here , '' said one , `` there is a great desert , and none could live to cross it . STOP `` It is the same at the South , '' said another , `` for I have been there and seen it STOP The South is the country of the Quadlings . STOP `` I am told , '' said the third man , `` that it is the same at the West STOP And that country , where the Winkies live , is ruled by the wicked Witch of the West , who would make you her slave if you passed her way . STOP `` The North is my home , '' said the old lady , `` and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this land of Oz STOP I 'm afraid , my dear , you will have to live with us . STOP Dorothy began to sob , at this , for she felt lonely among all these strange people STOP Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins , for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also STOP As for the little old woman , she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose , while she counted '' one , two , three '' in a solemn voice STOP At once the cap changed to a slate , on which was written in big , white chalk marks : '' LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS . STOP [ Illustration ] The little old woman took the slate from her nose , and , having read the words on it , asked , '' Is your name Dorothy , my dear ? STOP `` Yes , '' answered the child , looking up and drying her tears STOP `` Then you must go to the City of Emeralds STOP Perhaps Oz will help you . STOP `` Where is this City ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` It is exactly in the center of the country , and is ruled by Oz , the Great Wizard I told you of . STOP `` Is he a good man ? STOP enquired the girl , anxiously STOP `` He is a good Wizard STOP Whether he is a man or not I can not tell , for I have never seen him . STOP `` How can I get there ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` You must walk STOP It is a long journey , through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible STOP However , I will use all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm . STOP `` Wo n't you go with me ? STOP pleaded the girl , who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend STOP `` No , I can not do that , '' she replied ; `` but I will give you my kiss , and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North . STOP She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead STOP Where her lips touched the girl they left a round , shining mark , as Dorothy found out soon after STOP `` The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick , '' said the Witch ; `` so you can not miss it STOP When you get to Oz do not be afraid of him , but tell your story and ask him to help you STOP Good-bye , my dear . STOP [ Illustration ] The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey , after which they walked away through the trees STOP The Witch gave Dorothy a friendly little nod , whirled around on her left heel three times , and straightway disappeared , much to the surprise of little Toto , who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone , because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by STOP But Dorothy , knowing her to be a witch , had expected her to disappear in just that way , and was not surprised in the least STOP How Dorothy saved the Scarecrow STOP [ Illustration ] When Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry STOP So she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread , which she spread with butter STOP She gave some to Toto , and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear , sparkling water STOP Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there STOP Dorothy went to get him , and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it , finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast STOP Then she went back to the house , and having helped herself and Toto to a good drink of the cool , clear water , she set about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds STOP Dorothy had only one other dress , but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed STOP It was gingham , with checks of white and blue ; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings , it was still a pretty frock STOP The girl washed herself carefully , dressed herself in the clean gingham , and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head STOP She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard , laying a white cloth over the top STOP Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were STOP `` They surely will never do for a long journey , Toto , '' she said STOP And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant STOP At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East STOP `` I wonder if they will fit me , '' she said to Toto STOP `` They would be just the thing to take a long walk in , for they could not wear out . STOP She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones , which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her STOP Finally she picked up her basket STOP `` Come along , Toto , '' she said , `` we will go to the Emerald City and ask the great Oz how to get back to Kansas again . STOP She closed the door , locked it , and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress STOP And so , with Toto trotting along soberly behind her , she started on her journey STOP There were several roads near by , but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow brick STOP Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald City , her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard , yellow roadbed STOP The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweet and Dorothy did not feel nearly as bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land STOP [ Illustration ] She was surprised , as she walked along , to see how pretty the country was about her STOP There were neat fences at the sides of the road , painted a dainty blue color , and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance STOP Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops STOP Once in a while she would pass a house , and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by ; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the wicked witch and setting them free from bondage STOP The houses of the Munchkins were odd looking dwellings , for each was round , with a big dome for a roof STOP All were painted blue , for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color STOP Towards evening , when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night , she came to a house rather larger than the rest STOP On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing STOP Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and the people were laughing and singing , while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts , pies and cakes , and many other good things to eat STOP The people greeted Dorothy kindly , and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them ; for this was the home of one of the richest Munchkins in the land , and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the wicked witch STOP Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin himself , whose name was Boq STOP Then she sat down upon a settee and watched the people dance STOP When Boq saw her silver shoes he said , '' You must be a great sorceress . STOP `` Why ? STOP asked the girl STOP `` Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the wicked witch STOP Besides , you have white in your frock , and only witches and sorceresses wear white . STOP [ Illustration : `` _You must be a great sorceress._ '' ] '' My dress is blue and white checked , '' said Dorothy , smoothing out the wrinkles in it STOP `` It is kind of you to wear that , '' said Boq STOP `` Blue is the color of the Munchkins , and white is the witch color ; so we know you are a friendly witch . STOP Dorothy did not know what to say to this , for all the people seemed to think her a witch , and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land STOP When she had tired watching the dancing , Boq led her into the house , where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it STOP The sheets were made of blue cloth , and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning , with Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her STOP She ate a hearty breakfast , and watched a wee Munchkin baby , who played with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused Dorothy STOP Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people , for they had never seen a dog before STOP `` How far is it to the Emerald City ? STOP the girl asked STOP [ Illustration ] '' I do not know , '' answered Boq , gravely , `` for I have never been there STOP It is better for people to keep away from Oz , unless they have business with him STOP But it is a long way to the Emerald City , and it will take you many days STOP The country here is rich and pleasant , but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey . STOP This worried Dorothy a little , but she knew that only the great Oz could help her get to Kansas again , so she bravely resolved not to turn back STOP She bade her friends good-bye , and again started along the road of yellow brick STOP When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest , and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down STOP There was a great cornfield beyond the fence , and not far away she saw a Scarecrow , placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn STOP Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow STOP Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw , with eyes , nose and mouth painted on it to represent a face STOP An old , pointed blue hat , that had belonged to some Munchkin , was perched on this head , and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes , worn and faded , which had also been stuffed with straw STOP On the feet were some old boots with blue tops , such as every man wore in this country , and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back STOP [ Illustration : `` _Dorothy gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow._ '' ] While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer , painted face of the Scarecrow , she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her STOP She thought she must have been mistaken , at first , for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink ; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way STOP Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it , while Toto ran around the pole and barked STOP `` Good day , '' said the Scarecrow , in a rather husky voice STOP `` Did you speak ? STOP asked the girl , in wonder STOP `` Certainly , '' answered the Scarecrow ; `` how do you do ? STOP `` I 'm pretty well , thank you , '' replied Dorothy , politely ; `` how do you do ? STOP `` I 'm not feeling well , '' said the Scarecrow , with a smile , `` for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows . STOP `` Ca n't you get down ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` No , for this pole is stuck up my back STOP If you will please take away the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you . STOP Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole ; for , being stuffed with straw , it was quite light STOP `` Thank you very much , '' said the Scarecrow , when he had been set down on the ground STOP `` I feel like a new man . STOP Dorothy was puzzled at this , for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak , and to see him bow and walk along beside her STOP `` Who are you ? STOP asked the Scarecrow , when he had stretched himself and yawned , `` and where are you going ? STOP `` My name is Dorothy , '' said the girl , `` and I am going to the Emerald City , to ask the great Oz to send me back to Kansas . STOP `` Where is the Emerald City ? STOP he enquired ; `` and who is Oz ? STOP `` Why , do n't you know ? STOP she returned , in surprise STOP `` No , indeed ; I do n't know anything STOP You see , I am stuffed , so I have no brains at all , '' he answered , sadly STOP [ Illustration ] '' Oh , '' said Dorothy ; `` I 'm awfully sorry for you . STOP `` Do you think , '' he asked , `` If I go to the Emerald City with you , that the great Oz would give me some brains ? STOP `` I can not tell , '' she returned ; `` but you may come with me , if you like STOP If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now . STOP `` That is true , '' said the Scarecrow STOP `` You see , '' he continued , confidentially , `` I do n't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed , because I can not get hurt STOP If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me , it does n't matter , for I cant feel it STOP But I do not want people to call me a fool , and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains , as yours is , how am I ever to know anything ? STOP `` I understand how you feel , '' said the little girl , who was truly sorry for him STOP `` If you will come with me I 'll ask Oz to do all he can for you . STOP `` Thank you , '' he answered , gratefully STOP They walked back to the road , Dorothy helped him over the fence , and they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City STOP Toto did not like this addition to the party , at first STOP He smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw , and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow STOP `` Do n't mind Toto , '' said Dorothy , to her new friend ; `` he never bites . STOP `` Oh , I 'm not afraid , '' replied the Scarecrow , `` he ca n't hurt the straw STOP Do let me carry that basket for you STOP I shall not mind it , for I ca n't get tired STOP I 'll tell you a secret , '' he continued , as he walked along ; `` there is only one thing in the world I am afraid of . STOP `` What is that ? STOP asked Dorothy ; `` the Munchkin farmer who made you ? STOP `` No , '' answered the Scarecrow ; `` it 's a lighted match . STOP STOP The Road through the Forest STOP [ Illustration ] After a few hours the road began to be rough , and the walking grew so difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow brick , which were here very uneven STOP Sometimes , indeed , they were broken or missing altogether , leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy walked around STOP As for the Scarecrow , having no brains he walked straight ahead , and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks STOP It never hurt him , however , and Dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again , while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap STOP [ Illustration ] The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back STOP There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees , and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became STOP At noon they sat down by the roadside , near a little brook , and Dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread STOP She offered a piece to the Scarecrow , but he refused STOP `` I am never hungry , '' he said ; `` and it is a lucky thing I am not STOP For my mouth is only painted , and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat , the straw I am stuffed with would come out , and that would spoil the shape of my head . STOP Dorothy saw at once that this was true , so she only nodded and went on eating her bread STOP `` Tell me something about yourself , and the country you came from , '' said the Scarecrow , when she had finished her dinner STOP So she told him all about Kansas , and how gray everything was there , and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer land of Oz STOP The Scarecrow listened carefully , and said , '' I can not understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry , gray place you call Kansas . STOP [ Illustration : `` _ ' I was only made yesterday , ' said the Scarecrow._ '' ] '' That is because you have no brains , '' answered the girl STOP `` No matter how dreary and gray our homes are , we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country , be it ever so beautiful STOP There is no place like home . STOP The Scarecrow sighed STOP `` Of course I can not understand it , '' he said STOP `` If your heads were stuffed with straw , like mine , you would probably all live in the beautiful places , and then Kansas would have no people at all STOP It is fortunate for Kansas that you have brains . STOP `` Wo n't you tell me a story , while we are resting ? STOP asked the child STOP The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully , and answered , '' My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever STOP I was only made day before yesterday STOP What happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me STOP Luckily , when the farmer made my head , one of the first things he did was to paint my ears , so that I heard what was going on STOP There was another Munchkin with him , and the first thing I heard was the farmer saying , '' 'How do you like those ears ? STOP `` 'They are n't straight , ' answered the other STOP `` 'Never mind , ' said the farmer ; 'they are ears just the same , ' which was true enough STOP `` 'Now I 'll make the eyes , ' said the farmer STOP So he painted my right eye , and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity , for this was my first glimpse of the world STOP `` 'That 's a rather pretty eye , ' remarked the Munchkin who was watching the farmer ; 'blue paint is just the color for eyes . STOP `` ' I think I 'll make the other a little bigger , ' said the farmer ; and when the second eye was done I could see much better than before STOP Then he made my nose and my mouth ; but I did not speak , because at that time I did n't know what a mouth was for STOP I had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs ; and when they fastened on my head , at last , I felt very proud , for I thought I was just as good a man as anyone STOP `` 'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough , ' said the farmer ; 'he looks just like a man . STOP `` 'Why , he is a man , ' said the other , and I quite agreed with him STOP The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield , and set me up on a tall stick , where you found me STOP He and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone STOP `` I did not like to be deserted this way ; so I tried to walk after them , but my feet would not touch the ground , and I was forced to stay on that pole STOP It was a lonely life to lead , for I had nothing to think of , having been made such a little while before STOP Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield , but as soon as they saw me they flew away again , thinking I was a Munchkin ; and this pleased me and made me feel that I was quite an important person STOP By and by an old crow flew near me , and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said , [ Illustration ] '' ' I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner STOP Any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw . STOP Then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted STOP The other birds , seeing he was not harmed by me , came to eat the corn too , so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me . STOP `` I felt sad at this , for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow after all ; but the old crow comforted me , saying : 'If you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them , and a better man than some of them STOP Brains are the only things worth having in this world , no matter whether one is a crow or a man . STOP `` After the crows had gone I thought this over , and decided I would try hard to get some brains STOP By good luck , you came along and pulled me off the stake , and from what you say I am sure the great Oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City . STOP `` I hope so , '' said Dorothy , earnestly , `` since you seem anxious to have them . STOP `` Oh yes ; I am anxious , '' returned the Scarecrow STOP `` It is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool . STOP [ Illustration ] '' Well , '' said the girl , `` let us go . STOP And she handed the basket to the Scarecrow STOP There were no fences at all by the road side now , and the land was rough and untilled STOP Towards evening they came to a great forest , where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick STOP It was almost dark under the trees , for the branches shut out the daylight ; but the travellers did not stop , and went on into the forest STOP `` If this road goes in , it must come out , '' said the Scarecrow , `` and as the Emerald City is at the other end of the road , we must go wherever it leads us . STOP `` Anyone would know that , '' said Dorothy STOP `` Certainly ; that is why I know it , '' returned the Scarecrow STOP `` If it required brains to figure it out , I never should have said it . STOP After an hour or so the light faded away , and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness STOP Dorothy could not see at all , but Toto could , for some dogs see very well in the dark ; and the Scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day STOP So she took hold of his arm , and managed to get along fairly well STOP `` If you see any house , or any place where we can pass the night , '' she said , `` you must tell me ; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark . STOP Soon after the Scarecrow stopped STOP `` I see a little cottage at the right of us , '' he said , `` built of logs and branches STOP Shall we go there ? STOP `` Yes , indeed ; '' answered the child STOP `` I am all tired out . STOP So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage , and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner STOP She lay down at once , and with Toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep STOP The Scarecrow , who was never tired , stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came STOP [ Illustration ] STOP The Rescue of the Tin Woodman [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] When Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had long been out chasing birds and squirrels STOP She sat up and looked around her STOP There was the Scarecrow , still standing patiently in his corner , waiting for her STOP `` We must go and search for water , '' she said to him STOP `` Why do you want water ? STOP he asked STOP `` To wash my face clean after the dust of the road , and to drink , so the dry bread will not stick in my throat . STOP `` It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh , '' said the Scarecrow , thoughtfully ; `` for you must sleep , and eat and drink STOP However , you have brains , and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly . STOP They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water , where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast STOP She saw there was not much bread left in the basket , and the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything , for there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day STOP When she had finished her meal , and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick , she was startled to hear a deep groan near by STOP `` What was that ? STOP she asked , timidly STOP `` I can not imagine , '' replied the Scarecrow ; `` but we can go and see . STOP Just then another groan reached their ears , and the sound seemed to come from behind them STOP They turned and walked through the forest a few steps , when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees STOP She ran to the place , and then stopped short , with a cry of surprise STOP One of the big trees had been partly chopped through , and standing beside it , with an uplifted axe in his hands , was a man made entirely of tin STOP His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body , but he stood perfectly motionless , as if he could not stir at all STOP Dorothy looked at him in amazement , and so did the Scarecrow , while Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs , which hurt his teeth STOP `` Did you groan ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` Yes , '' answered the tin man ; `` I did STOP I 've been groaning for more than a year , and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me . STOP `` What can I do for you ? STOP she enquired , softly , for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke STOP [ Illustration ] '' Get an oil-can and oil my joints , '' he answered STOP `` They are rusted so badly that I can not move them at all ; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again STOP You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage . STOP Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can , and then she returned and asked , anxiously , '' Where are your joints ? STOP `` Oil my neck , first , '' replied the Tin Woodman STOP So she oiled it , and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely , and then the man could turn it himself STOP `` Now oil the joints in my arms , '' he said STOP And Dorothy oiled them and the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new STOP The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe , which he leaned against the tree STOP `` This is a great comfort , '' he said STOP `` I have been holding that axe in the air ever since I rusted , and I 'm glad to be able to put it down at last STOP Now , if you will oil the joints of my legs , I shall be all right once more . STOP So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely ; and he thanked them again and again for his release , for he seemed a very polite creature , and very grateful STOP `` I might have stood there always if you had not come along , '' he said ; '' so you have certainly saved my life STOP How did you happen to be here ? STOP `` We are on our way to the Emerald City , to see the great Oz , '' she answered , `` and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night . STOP `` Why do you wish to see Oz ? STOP he asked STOP `` I want him to send me back to Kansas ; and the Scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head , '' she replied STOP The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment STOP Then he said : '' Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart ? STOP `` Why , I guess so , '' Dorothy answered ; `` it would be as easy as to give the Scarecrow brains . STOP [ Illustration : `` _'This is a great comfort , ' said the Tin Woodman._ '' ] '' True , '' the Tin Woodman returned STOP `` So , if you will allow me to join your party , I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me . STOP `` Come along , '' said the Scarecrow , heartily ; and Dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company STOP So the Tin Woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick STOP The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket STOP `` For , '' he said , `` if I should get caught in the rain , and rust again , I would need the oil-can badly . STOP It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party , for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travellers could not pass STOP But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party STOP Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road STOP Indeed , he was obliged to call to her to help him up again STOP `` Why did n't you walk around the hole ? STOP asked the Tin Woodman STOP `` I do n't know enough , '' replied the Scarecrow , cheerfully STOP `` My head is stuffed with straw , you know , and that is why I am going to Oz to ask him for some brains . STOP `` Oh , I see ; '' said the Tin Woodman STOP `` But , after all , brains are not the best things in the world . STOP `` Have you any ? STOP enquired the Scarecrow STOP `` No , my head is quite empty , '' answered the Woodman ; `` but once I had brains , and a heart also ; so , having tried them both , I should much rather have a heart . STOP `` And why is that ? STOP asked the Scarecrow STOP `` I will tell you my story , and then you will know . STOP So , while they were walking through the forest , the Tin Woodman told the following story : '' I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living STOP When I grew up I too became a wood-chopper , and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived STOP Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry , so that I might not become lonely STOP [ Illustration ] '' There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to love her with all my heart STOP She , on her part , promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her ; so I set to work harder than ever STOP But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone , for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework STOP So the old woman went to the wicked Witch of the East , and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage STOP Thereupon the wicked Witch enchanted my axe , and when I was chopping away at my best one day , for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible , the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg STOP `` This at first seemed a great misfortune , for I knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper STOP So I went to a tin-smith and had him make me a new leg out of tin STOP The leg worked very well , once I was used to it ; but my action angered the wicked Witch of the East , for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl STOP When I began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg STOP Again I went to the tinner , and again he made me a leg out of tin STOP After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms , one after the other ; but , nothing daunted , I had them replaced with tin ones STOP The wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head , and at first I thought that was the end of me STOP But the tinner happened to come along , and he made me a new head out of tin STOP `` I thought I had beaten the wicked Witch then , and I worked harder than ever ; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be STOP She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden , and made my axe slip again , so that it cut right through my body , splitting me into two halves STOP Once more the tinner came to my help and made me a body of tin , fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it , by means of joints , so that I could move around as well as ever STOP But , alas STOP I had now no heart , so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl , and did not care whether I married her or not STOP I suppose she is still living with the old woman , waiting for me to come after her STOP [ Illustration ] '' My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped , for it could not cut me STOP There was only one danger -- that my joints would rust ; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it STOP However , there came a day when I forgot to do this , and , being caught in a rainstorm , before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted , and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me STOP It was a terrible thing to undergo , but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart STOP While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth ; but no one can love who has not a heart , and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one STOP If he does , I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her . STOP Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the Tin Woodman , and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart STOP `` All the same , '' said the Scarecrow , `` I shall ask for brains instead of a heart ; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one . STOP `` I shall take the heart , '' returned the Tin Woodman ; `` for brains do not make one happy , and happiness is the best thing in the world . STOP Dorothy did not say anything , for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right , and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Em it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the Scarecrow no heart , or each got what he wanted STOP [ Illustration ] What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone , and another meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket STOP To be sure neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything , but she was not made of tin nor straw , and could not live unless she was fed STOP STOP The Cowardly Lion STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration : `` _You ought to be ashamed of yourself ! _ '' ] [ Illustration ] All this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods STOP The road was still paved with yellow brick , but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees , and the walking was not at all good STOP There were few birds in this part of the forest , for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine ; but now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees STOP These sounds made the little girl 's heart beat fast , for she did not know what made them ; but Toto knew , and he walked close to Dorothy's side , and did not even bark in return STOP `` How long will it be , '' the child asked of the Tin Woodman , `` before we are out of the forest ? STOP `` I can not tell , '' was the answer , `` for I have never been to the Emerald City STOP But my father went there once , when I was a boy , and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country , although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful STOP But I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can , and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow , while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the good Witch 's kiss , and that will protect you from harm . STOP `` But Toto ! STOP said the girl , anxiously ; `` what will protect him ? STOP `` We must protect him ourselves , if he is in danger , '' replied the Tin Woodman STOP Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar , and the next moment a great Lion bounded into the road STOP With one blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road , and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws STOP But , to the Lion 's surprise , he could make no impression on the tin , although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still STOP Little Toto , now that he had an enemy to face , ran barking toward the Lion , and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog , when Dorothy , fearing Toto would be killed , and heedless of danger , rushed forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could , while she cried out : '' Do n't you dare to bite Toto STOP You ought to be ashamed of yourself , a big beast like you , to bite a poor little dog ! STOP `` I did n't bite him , '' said the Lion , as he rubbed his nose with his paw where Dorothy had hit it STOP `` No , but you tried to , '' she retorted STOP `` You are nothing but a big coward . STOP `` I know it , '' said the Lion , hanging his head in shame ; `` I 've always known it STOP But how can I help it ? STOP `` I do n't know , I 'm sure STOP To think of your striking a stuffed man , like the poor Scarecrow ! STOP `` Is he stuffed ? STOP asked the Lion , in surprise , as he watched her pick up the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet , while she patted him into shape again STOP `` Of course he 's stuffed , '' replied Dorothy , who was still angry STOP `` That 's why he went over so easily , '' remarked the Lion STOP `` It astonished me to see him whirl around so STOP Is the other one stuffed , also ? STOP `` No , '' said Dorothy , `` he 's made of tin . STOP And she helped the Woodman up again STOP `` That 's why he nearly blunted my claws , '' said the Lion STOP `` When they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back STOP What is that little animal you are so tender of ? STOP `` He is my dog , Toto , '' answered Dorothy STOP `` Is he made of tin , or stuffed ? STOP asked the Lion STOP `` Neither STOP He 's a -- a -- a meat dog , '' said the girl STOP `` Oh STOP He 's a curious animal , and seems remarkably small , now that I look at him STOP No one would think of biting such a little thing except a coward like me , '' continued the Lion , sadly STOP `` What makes you a coward ? STOP asked Dorothy , looking at the great beast in wonder , for he was as big as a small horse STOP [ Illustration ] '' It 's a mystery , '' replied the Lion STOP `` I suppose I was born that way STOP All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave , for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts STOP I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way STOP Whenever I 've met a man I 've been awfully scared ; but I just roared at him , and he has always run away as fast as he could go STOP If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me , I should have run myself -- I 'm such a coward ; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me , and of course I let them go . STOP `` But that is n't right STOP The King of Beasts should n't be a coward , '' said the Scarecrow STOP `` I know it , '' returned the Lion , wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail ; `` it is my great sorrow , and makes my life very unhappy STOP But whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast . STOP `` Perhaps you have heart disease , '' said the Tin Woodman STOP `` It may be , '' said the Lion STOP `` If you have , '' continued the Tin Woodman , `` you ought to be glad , for it proves you have a heart STOP For my part , I have no heart ; so I can not have heart disease . STOP `` Perhaps , '' said the Lion , thoughtfully , `` if I had no heart I should not be a coward . STOP `` Have you brains ? STOP asked the Scarecrow STOP `` I suppose so STOP I 've never looked to see , '' replied the Lion STOP `` I am going to the great Oz to ask him to give me some , '' remarked the Scarecrow , `` for my head is stuffed with straw . STOP `` And I am going to ask him to give me a heart , '' said the Woodman STOP `` And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas , '' added Dorothy STOP `` Do you think Oz could give me courage ? STOP asked the cowardly Lion STOP `` Just as easily as he could give me brains , '' said the Scarecrow STOP `` Or give me a heart , '' said the Tin Woodman STOP `` Or send me back to Kansas , '' said Dorothy STOP `` Then , if you do n't mind , I 'll go with you , '' said the Lion , `` for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage . STOP `` You will be very welcome , '' answered Dorothy , `` for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts STOP It seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily . STOP `` They really are , '' said the Lion ; `` but that does n't make me any braver , and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy . STOP So once more the little company set off upon the journey , the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy 's side STOP Toto did not approve this new comrade at first , for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the Lion 's great jaws ; but after a time he became more at ease , and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends STOP During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey STOP Once , indeed , the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road , and killed the poor little thing STOP This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy , for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature ; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret STOP These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw , and there they rusted STOP When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth , for his jaws were tightly rusted together STOP He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him , but she could not understand STOP The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong STOP But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy 's basket and oiled the Woodman 's jaws , so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before STOP [ Illustration ] '' This will serve me a lesson , '' said he , `` to look where I step STOP For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again , and crying rusts my jaw so that I can not speak . STOP Thereafter he walked very carefully , with his eyes on the road , and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it , so as not to harm it STOP The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart , and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything STOP `` You people with hearts , '' he said , `` have something to guide you , and need never do wrong ; but I have no heart , and so I must be very careful STOP When Oz gives me a heart of course I need n't mind so much . STOP STOP The Journey to The Great Oz STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest , for there were no houses near STOP The tree made a good , thick covering to protect them from the dew , and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely STOP She and Toto ate the last of their bread , and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast STOP `` If you wish , '' said the Lion , `` I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you STOP You can roast it by the fire , since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food , and then you will have a very good breakfast . STOP `` Do n't STOP please do n't , '' begged the Tin Woodman STOP `` I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer , and then my jaws would rust again . STOP [ Illustration ] But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper , and no one ever knew what it was , for he did n't mention it STOP And the Scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy 's basket with them , so that she would not be hungry for a long time STOP She thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow , but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts STOP His padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket STOP But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket , for it enabled him to keep away from the fire , as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up STOP So he kept a good distance away from the flames , and only came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep STOP These kept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning STOP When it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City STOP This was to be an eventful day for the travellers STOP They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side STOP It was a very wide ditch , and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep , and there were many big , jagged rocks at the bottom STOP The sides were so steep that none of them could climb down , and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end STOP `` What shall we do ? STOP asked Dorothy , despairingly STOP `` I have n't the faintest idea , '' said the Tin Woodman ; and the Lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful STOP But the Scarecrow said : '' We can not fly , that is certain ; neither can we climb down into this great ditch STOP Therefore , if we can not jump over it , we must stop where we are . STOP `` I think I could jump over it , '' said the Cowardly Lion , after measuring the distance carefully in his mind STOP `` Then we are all right , '' answered the Scarecrow , `` for you can carry us all over on your back , one at a time . STOP `` Well , I 'll try it , '' said the Lion STOP `` Who will go first ? STOP `` I will , '' declared the Scarecrow ; `` for , if you found that you could not jump over the gulf , Dorothy would be killed , or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the rocks below STOP But if I am on your back it will not matter so much , for the fall would not hurt me at all . STOP [ Illustration ] '' I am terribly afraid of falling , myself , '' said the Cowardly Lion , '' but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it STOP So get on my back and we will make the attempt . STOP The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion 's back , and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down STOP `` Why do n't you run and jump ? STOP asked the Scarecrow STOP `` Because that is n't the way we Lions do these things , '' he replied STOP Then giving a great spring , he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side STOP They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it , and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang across the ditch again STOP Dorothy thought she would go next ; so she took Toto in her arms and climbed on the Lion 's back , holding tightly to his mane with one hand STOP The next moment it seemed as if she was flying through the air ; and then , before she had time to think about it , she was safe on the other side STOP The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman , and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest , for his great leaps had made his breath short , and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long STOP [ Illustration ] They found the forest very thick on this side , and it looked dark and gloomy STOP After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick , silently wondering , each in his own mind , if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again STOP To add to their discomfort , they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest , and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived STOP `` What are the Kalidahs ? STOP asked the girl STOP `` They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers , '' replied the Lion ; `` and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto STOP I'm terribly afraid of the Kalidahs . STOP `` I 'm not surprised that you are , '' returned Dorothy `` They must be dreadful beasts . STOP The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road ; but this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew at once he could not leap across it STOP So they sat down to consider what they should do , and after serious thought the Scarecrow said , '' Here is a great tree , standing close to the ditch STOP If the Tin Woodman can chop it down , so that it will fall to the other side , we can walk across it easily . STOP `` That is a first rate idea , '' said the Lion STOP `` One would almost suspect you had brains in your head , instead of straw . STOP The Woodman set to work at once , and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through STOP Then the Lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might , and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch , with its top branches on the other side STOP They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up , and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers STOP `` They are the Kalidahs ! STOP said the Cowardly Lion , beginning to tremble STOP `` Quick ! STOP cried the Scarecrow , `` let us cross over . STOP [ Illustration : `` _The tree fell with a crash into the gulf._ '' ] So Dorothy went first , holding Toto in her arms ; the Tin Woodman followed , and the Scarecrow came next STOP The Lion , although he was certainly afraid , turned to face the Kalidahs , and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over backwards , while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise STOP But , seeing they were bigger than the Lion , and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him , the Kalidahs again rushed forward , and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next STOP Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree , and the Lion said to Dorothy , '' We are lost , for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws STOP But stand close behind me , and I will fight them as long as I am alive . STOP `` Wait a minute ! STOP called the Scarecrow STOP He had been thinking what was best to be done , and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch STOP The Tin Woodman began to use his axe at once , and , just as the two Kalidahs were nearly across , the tree fell with a crash into the gulf , carrying the ugly , snarling brutes with it , and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom STOP `` Well , '' said the Cowardly Lion , drawing a long breath of relief , `` I see we are going to live a little while longer , and I am glad of it , for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive STOP Those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet . STOP `` Ah . STOP said the Tin Woodman , sadly , `` I wish I had a heart to beat . STOP [ Illustration ] This adventure made the travellers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest , and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired , and had to ride on the Lion 's back STOP To their great joy the trees became thinner the further they advanced , and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river , flowing swiftly just before them STOP On the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country , with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits STOP They were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them STOP `` How shall we cross the river ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` That is easily done , '' replied the Scarecrow STOP `` The Tin Woodman must build us a raft , so we can float to the other side . STOP So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft , and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the river bank a tree full of fine fruit STOP This pleased Dorothy , who had eaten nothing but nuts all day , and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit STOP But it takes time to make a raft , even when one is as industrious and untiring as the Tin Woodman , and when night came the work was not done STOP So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning ; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City , and of the good Wizard Oz , who would soon send her back to her own home again STOP [ Illustration ] STOP The Deadly Poppy Field STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] Our little party of travellers awakened next morning refreshed and full of hope , and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river STOP Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through , although they had suffered many discouragements ; but before them was a lovely , sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City STOP To be sure , the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land ; but the raft was nearly done , and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins , they were ready to start STOP Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her arms STOP When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly , for he was big and heavy ; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it , and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water STOP They got along quite well at first , but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft down stream , farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick ; and the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom STOP `` This is bad , '' said the Tin Woodman , `` for if we can not get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the wicked Witch of the West , and she will enchant us and make us her slaves . STOP `` And then I should get no brains , '' said the Scarecrow STOP `` And I should get no courage , '' said the Cowardly Lion STOP [ Illustration ] '' And I should get no heart , '' said the Tin Woodman STOP `` And I should never get back to Kansas , '' said Dorothy STOP `` We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can , '' the Scarecrow continued , and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river , and before he could pull it out again , or let go , the raft was swept away and the poor Scarecrow left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river STOP `` Good bye ! STOP he called after them , and they were very sorry to leave him ; indeed , the Tin Woodman began to cry , but fortunately remembered that he might rust , and so dried his tears on Dorothy 's apron STOP Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow STOP `` I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy , '' he thought STOP `` Then , I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield , where I could make believe scare the crows , at any rate ; but surely there is no use for a Scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river STOP I am afraid I shall never have any brains , after all ! STOP [ Illustration ] Down the stream the raft floated , and the poor Scarecrow was left far behind STOP Then the Lion said : '' Something must be done to save us STOP I think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me , if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail . STOP [ Illustration ] So he sprang into the water and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his tail , when the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore STOP It was hard work , although he was so big ; but by and by they were drawn out of the current , and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman 's long pole and helped push the raft to the land STOP They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass , and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City STOP `` What shall we do now ? STOP asked the Tin Woodman , as the Lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him STOP `` We must get back to the road , in some way , '' said Dorothy STOP `` The best plan will be to walk along the river bank until we come to the road again , '' remarked the Lion STOP So , when they were rested , Dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank , back to the road from which the river had carried them STOP It was a lovely country , with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them , and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow they could have been very happy STOP They walked along as fast as they could , Dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower ; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out , '' Look ! STOP Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water , looking very lonely and sad STOP `` What can we do to save him ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads , for they did not know STOP So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by , which , seeing them , stopped to rest at the water 's edge STOP `` Who are you , and where are you going ? STOP asked the Stork STOP `` I am Dorothy , '' answered the girl ; `` and these are my friends , the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion ; and we are going to the Emerald City . STOP `` This is n't the road , '' said the Stork , as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party STOP `` I know it , '' returned Dorothy , `` but we have lost the Scarecrow , and are wondering how we shall get him again . STOP `` Where is he ? STOP asked the Stork STOP `` Over there in the river , '' answered the girl STOP `` If he was n't so big and heavy I would get him for you , '' remarked the Stork STOP `` He is n't heavy a bit , '' said Dorothy , eagerly , `` for he is stuffed with straw ; and if you will bring him back to us we shall thank you ever and ever so much . STOP `` Well , I 'll try , '' said the Stork ; `` but if I find he is too heavy to carry I shall have to drop him in the river again . STOP So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole STOP Then the Stork with her great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank , where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto were sitting STOP When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again he was so happy that he hugged them all , even the Lion and Toto ; and as they walked along he sang `` Tol-de-ri-de-oh ! STOP at every step , he felt so gay STOP `` I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever , '' he said , '' but the kind Stork saved me , and if I ever get any brains I shall find the Stork again and do it some kindness in return . STOP `` That 's all right , '' said the Stork , who was flying along beside them STOP `` I always like to help anyone in trouble STOP But I must go now , for my babies are waiting in the nest for me STOP I hope you will find the Emerald City and that Oz will help you . STOP `` Thank you , '' replied Dorothy , and then the kind Stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight STOP [ Illustration : `` _The Stork carried him up into the air._ '' ] They walked along listening to the singing of the bright-colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them STOP There were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms , besides great clusters of scarlet poppies , which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy 's eyes STOP `` Are n't they beautiful ? STOP the girl asked , as she breathed in the spicy scent of the flowers STOP `` I suppose so , '' answered the Scarecrow STOP `` When I have brains I shall probably like them better . STOP `` If I only had a heart I should love them , '' added the Tin Woodman STOP `` I always did like flowers , '' said the Lion ; `` they seem so helpless and frail STOP But there are none in the forest so bright as these . STOP They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies , and fewer and fewer of the other flowers ; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies STOP Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep , and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever STOP But Dorothy did not know this , nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about ; so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep STOP But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this STOP `` We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark , '' he said ; and the Scarecrow agreed with him STOP So they kept walking until Dorothy could stand no longer STOP Her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies , fast asleep STOP `` What shall we do ? STOP asked the Tin Woodman STOP `` If we leave her here she will die , '' said the Lion STOP `` The smell of the flowers is killing us all STOP I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open and the dog is asleep already . STOP It was true ; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress STOP But the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman , not being made of flesh , were not troubled by the scent of the flowers STOP [ Illustration ] '' Run fast , '' said the Scarecrow to the Lion , `` and get out of this deadly flower-bed as soon as you can STOP We will bring the little girl with us , but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried . STOP So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go STOP In a moment he was out of sight STOP `` Let us make a chair with our hands , and carry her , '' said the Scarecrow STOP So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy 's lap , and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers STOP On and on they walked , and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end STOP They followed the bend of the river , and at last came upon their friend the Lion , lying fast asleep among the poppies STOP The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up , at last , and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy-bed , where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them STOP `` We can do nothing for him , '' said the Tin Woodman , sadly ; `` for he is much too heavy to lift STOP We must leave him here to sleep on forever , and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last . STOP `` I 'm sorry , '' said the Scarecrow ; `` the Lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly STOP But let us go on . STOP They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river , far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers , and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her STOP [ Illustration ] STOP The Queen of the Field Mice STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] '' We can not be far from the road of yellow brick , now , '' remarked the Scarecrow , as he stood beside the girl , `` for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away . STOP The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl , and turning his head ( which worked beautifully on hinges ) he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass towards them STOP It was , indeed , a great , yellow wildcat , and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something , for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open , showing two rows of ugly teeth , while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire STOP As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field-mouse , and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try to kill such a pretty , harmless creature STOP So the Woodman raised his axe , and as the wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast 's head clean off from its body , and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces STOP The field-mouse , now that it was freed from its enemy , stopped short ; and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said , in a squeaky little voice , '' Oh , thank you STOP Thank you ever so much for saving my life . STOP `` Do n't speak of it , I beg of you , '' replied the Woodman STOP `` I have no heart , you know , so I am careful to help all those who may need a friend , even if it happens to be only a mouse . STOP `` Only a mouse ! STOP cried the little animal , indignantly ; `` why , I am a Queen -- the Queen of all the field-mice ! STOP `` Oh , indeed , '' said the Woodman , making a bow STOP `` Therefore you have done a great deed , as well as a brave one , in saving my life , '' added the Queen STOP At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them , and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed , [ Illustration : `` _Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty , the Queen._ '' ] '' Oh , your Majesty , we thought you would be killed STOP How did you manage to escape the great Wildcat ? STOP and they all bowed so low to the little Queen that they almost stood upon their heads STOP `` This funny tin man , '' she answered , `` killed the Wildcat and saved my life STOP So hereafter you must all serve him , and obey his slightest wish . STOP `` We will ! STOP cried all the mice , in a shrill chorus STOP And then they scampered in all directions , for Toto had awakened from his sleep , and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group STOP Toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in Kansas , and he saw no harm in it STOP But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight , while he called to the mice : `` Come back STOP come back STOP Toto shall not hurt you . STOP At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from a clump of grass and asked , in a timid voice , '' Are you sure he will not bite us ? STOP `` I will not let him , '' said the Woodman ; `` so do not be afraid . STOP [ Illustration ] One by one the mice came creeping back , and Toto did not bark again , although he tried to get out of the Woodman 's arms , and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin STOP Finally one of the biggest mice spoke STOP `` Is there anything we can do , '' it asked , `` to repay you for saving the life of our Queen ? STOP `` Nothing that I know of , '' answered the Woodman ; but the Scarecrow , who had been trying to think , but could not because his head was stuffed with straw , said , quickly , '' Oh , yes ; you can save our friend , the Cowardly Lion , who is asleep in the poppy bed . STOP `` A Lion ! STOP cried the little Queen ; `` why , he would eat us all up . STOP `` Oh , no ; '' declared the Scarecrow ; `` this Lion is a coward . STOP `` Really ? STOP asked the Mouse STOP `` He says so himself , '' answered the Scarecrow , `` and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend STOP If you will help us to save him I promise that he shall treat you all with kindness . STOP `` Very well , '' said the Queen , `` we will trust you STOP But what shall we do ? STOP `` Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to obey you ? STOP `` Oh , yes ; there are thousands , '' she replied STOP `` Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible , and let each one bring a long piece of string . STOP The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people STOP As soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible STOP `` Now , '' said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman , `` you must go to those trees by the river-side and make a truck that will carry the Lion . STOP So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work ; and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees , from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches STOP He fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree-trunk STOP So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them STOP They came from all directions , and there were thousands of them : big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice ; and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth STOP It was about this time that Dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes STOP She was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass , with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly STOP But the Scarecrow told her about everything , and turning to the dignified little Mouse , he said , '' Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty , the Queen . STOP Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a courtesy , after which she became quite friendly with the little girl STOP The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck , using the strings they had brought STOP One end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck STOP Of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it ; but when all the mice had been harnessed they were able to pull it quite easily STOP Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit on it , and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the Lion lay asleep STOP [ Illustration ] After a great deal of hard work , for the Lion was heavy , they managed to get him up on the truck STOP Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start , for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep STOP [ Illustration ] At first the little creatures , many though they were , could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck ; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed from behind , and they got along better STOP Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields , where he could breathe the sweet , fresh air again , instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers STOP Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death STOP She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was glad he had been rescued STOP Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes STOP The Queen of the Mice was the last to leave STOP `` If ever you need us again , '' she said , `` come out into the field and call , and we shall hear you and come to your assistance STOP Good bye ! STOP `` Good bye ! STOP they all answered , and away the Queen ran , while Dorothy held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her STOP After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken ; and the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by , which she ate for her dinner STOP [ Illustration ] STOP The Guardian of the Gate STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened , for he had lain among the poppies a long while , breathing in their deadly fragrance ; but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive STOP `` I ran as fast as I could , '' he said , sitting down and yawning ; `` but the flowers were too strong for me STOP How did you get me out ? STOP Then they told him of the field-mice , and how they had generously saved him from death ; and the Cowardly Lion laughed , and said , '' I have always thought myself very big and terrible ; yet such small things as flowers came near to killing me , and such small animals as mice have saved my life STOP How strange it all is STOP But , comrades , what shall we do now ? STOP `` We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again , '' said Dorothy ; `` and then we can keep on to the Emerald City . STOP So , the Lion being fully refreshed , and feeling quite himself again , they all started upon the journey , greatly enjoying the walk through the soft , fresh grass ; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the great Oz dwelt STOP [ Illustration ] The road was smooth and well paved , now , and the country about was beautiful ; so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind , and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades STOP Once more they could see fences built beside the road ; but these were painted green , and when they came to a small house , in which a farmer evidently lived , that also was painted green STOP They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon , and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions ; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion , of which they were much afraid STOP The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins STOP [ Illustration ] '' This must be the Land of Oz , '' said Dorothy , `` and we are surely getting near the Emerald City . STOP `` Yes , '' answered the Scarecrow ; `` everything is green here , while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color STOP But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins and I 'm afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night . STOP `` I should like something to eat besides fruit , '' said the girl , `` and I 'm sure Toto is nearly starved STOP Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people . STOP So , when they came to a good sized farm house , Dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked STOP A woman opened it just far enough to look out , and said , '' What do you want , child , and why is that great Lion with you ? STOP `` We wish to pass the night with you , if you will allow us , '' answered Dorothy ; `` and the Lion is my friend and comrade , and would not hurt you for the world . STOP `` Is he tame ? STOP asked the woman , opening the door a little wider STOP `` Oh , yes ; '' said the girl , `` and he is a great coward , too ; so that he will be more afraid of you than you are of him . STOP `` Well , '' said the woman , after thinking it over and taking another peep at the Lion , `` if that is the case you may come in , and I will give you some supper and a place to sleep . STOP So they all entered the house , where there were , besides the woman , two children and a man STOP The man had hurt his leg , and was lying on the couch in a corner STOP They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company , and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked , '' Where are you all going ? STOP `` To the Emerald City , '' said Dorothy , `` to see the Great Oz . STOP `` Oh , indeed ! STOP exclaimed the man STOP `` Are you sure that Oz will see you ? STOP `` Why not ? STOP she replied STOP `` Why , it is said that he never lets any one come into his presence STOP I have been to the Emerald City many times , and it is a beautiful and wonderful place ; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz , nor do I know of any living person who has seen him . STOP `` Does he never go out ? STOP asked the Scarecrow STOP `` Never STOP He sits day after day in the great throne room of his palace , and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face . STOP `` What is he like ? STOP asked the girl STOP `` That is hard to tell , '' said the man , thoughtfully STOP `` You see , Oz is a great Wizard , and can take on any form he wishes STOP So that some say he looks like a bird ; and some say he looks like an elephant ; and some say he looks like a cat STOP To others he appears as a beautiful fairy , or a brownie , or in any other form that pleases him STOP But who the real Oz is , when he is in his own form , no living person can tell . STOP `` That is very strange , '' said Dorothy ; `` but we must try , in some way , to see him , or we shall have made our journey for nothing . STOP [ Illustration ] '' Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz ? STOP asked the man STOP `` I want him to give me some brains , '' said the Scarecrow , eagerly STOP `` Oh , Oz could do that easily enough , '' declared the man STOP `` He has more brains than he needs . STOP `` And I want him to give me a heart , '' said the Tin Woodman STOP `` That will not trouble him , '' continued the man , `` for Oz has a large collection of hearts , of all sizes and shapes . STOP `` And I want him to give me courage , '' said the Cowardly Lion STOP `` Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his throne room , '' said the man , '' which he has covered with a golden plate , to keep it from running over STOP He will be glad to give you some . STOP `` And I want him to send me back to Kansas , '' said Dorothy STOP `` Where is Kansas ? STOP asked the man , in surprise STOP `` I do n't know , '' replied Dorothy , sorrowfully ; `` but it is my home , and I 'm sure it 's somewhere . STOP `` Very likely STOP Well , Oz can do anything ; so I suppose he will find Kansas for you STOP But first you must get to see him , and that will be a hard task ; for the great Wizard does not like to see anyone , and he usually has his own way STOP But what do you want ? STOP he continued , speaking to Toto STOP Toto only wagged his tail ; for , strange to say , he could not speak STOP [ Illustration : `` _The Lion ate some of the porridge._ '' ] The woman now called to them that supper was ready , so they gathered around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread , and enjoyed her meal STOP The Lion ate some of the porridge , but did not care for it , saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses , not for lions STOP The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all STOP Toto ate a little of everything , and was glad to get a good supper again STOP The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in , and Toto lay down beside her , while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed STOP The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night , although of course they could not sleep STOP The next morning , as soon as the sun was up , they started on their way , and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them STOP `` That must be the Emerald City , '' said Dorothy STOP As they walked on , the green glow became brighter and brighter , and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels STOP Yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the City STOP It was high , and thick , and of a bright green color STOP In front of them , and at the end of the road of yellow brick , was a big gate , all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy STOP There was a bell beside the gate , and Dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within STOP Then the big gate swung slowly open , and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room , the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds STOP Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins STOP He was clothed all in green , from his head to his feet , and even his skin was of a greenish tint STOP At his side was a large green box STOP When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked , '' What do you wish in the Emerald City ? STOP `` We came here to see the Great Oz , '' said Dorothy STOP The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over STOP `` It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz , '' he said , shaking his head in perplexity STOP `` He is powerful and terrible , and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great Wizard , he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant . STOP [ Illustration ] '' But it is not a foolish errand , nor an idle one , '' replied the Scarecrow ; `` it is important STOP And we have been told that Oz is a good Wizard . STOP `` So he is , '' said the green man ; `` and he rules the Emerald City wisely and well STOP But to those who are not honest , or who approach him from curiosity , he is most terrible , and few have ever dared ask to see his face STOP I am the Guardian of the Gates , and since you demand to see the Great Oz I must take you to his palace STOP But first you must put on the spectacles . STOP `` Why ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the Emerald City would blind you STOP Even those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and day STOP They are all locked on , for Oz so ordered it when the City was first built , and I have the only key that will unlock them . STOP [ Illustration ] He opened the big box , and Dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape STOP All of them had green glasses in them STOP The Guardian of the gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her eyes STOP There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head , where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck STOP When they were on , Dorothy could not take them off had she wished , but of course she did not want to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City , so she said nothing STOP Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion , and even on little Toto ; and all were locked fast with the key STOP Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the palace STOP Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall he opened another gate , and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City STOP STOP The Wonderful Emerald City of Oz STOP [ Illustration ] Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles Dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City STOP The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds STOP They walked over a pavement of the same green marble , and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds , set closely , and glittering in the brightness of the sun STOP The window panes were of green glass ; even the sky above the City had a green tint , and the rays of the sun were green STOP There were many people , men , women and children , walking about , and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins STOP They looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes , and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Lion ; but no one spoke to them STOP Many shops stood in the street , and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green STOP Green candy and green pop-corn were offered for sale , as well as green shoes , green hats and green clothes of all sorts STOP At one place a man was selling green lemonade , and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies STOP There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind ; the men carried things around in little green carts , which they pushed before them STOP Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous STOP The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building , exactly in the middle of the City , which was the Palace of Oz , the Great Wizard STOP There was a soldier before the door , dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard STOP `` Here are strangers , '' said the Guardian of the Gates to him , `` and they demand to see the Great Oz . STOP `` Step inside , '' answered the soldier , `` and I will carry your message to him . STOP So they passed through the Palace gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds STOP The soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room , and when they were seated he said , politely , '' Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the Throne Room and tell Oz you are here . STOP They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned STOP When , at last , he came back , Dorothy asked , '' Have you seen Oz ? STOP [ Illustration ] '' Oh , no ; '' returned the soldier ; `` I have never seen him STOP But I spoke to him as he sat behind his screen , and gave him your message STOP He says he will grant you an audience , if you so desire ; but each one of you must enter his presence alone , and he will admit but one each day STOP Therefore , as you must remain in the Palace for several days , I will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey . STOP `` Thank you , '' replied the girl ; `` that is very kind of Oz . STOP The soldier now blew upon a green whistle , and at once a young girl , dressed in a pretty green silk gown , entered the room STOP She had lovely green hair and green eyes , and she bowed low before Dorothy as she said , '' Follow me and I will show you your room . STOP So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto , and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace STOP It was the sweetest little room in the world , with a soft , comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane STOP There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room , that shot a spray of green perfume into the air , to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin STOP Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows , and there was a shelf with a row of little green books STOP When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh , they were so funny STOP In a wardrobe were many green dresses , made of silk and satin and velvet ; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly STOP `` Make yourself perfectly at home , '' said the green girl , `` and if you wish for anything ring the bell STOP Oz will send for you to-morrow morning . STOP She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others STOP These she also led to rooms , and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace STOP Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow ; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot , just within the doorway , to wait till morning STOP It would not rest him to lie down , and he could not close his eyes ; so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room , just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world STOP The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit , for he remembered when he was made of flesh ; but not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order STOP The Lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest , and did not like being shut up in a room ; but he had too much sense to let this worry him , so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute STOP The next morning , after breakfast , the green maiden came to fetch Dorothy , and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns -- made of green brocaded satin STOP Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Toto 's neck , and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Oz STOP [ Illustration ] First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court , all dressed in rich costumes STOP These people had nothing to do but talk to each other , but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning , although they were never permitted to see Oz STOP As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously , and one of them whispered , '' Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible ? STOP `` Of course , '' answered the girl , `` if he will see me . STOP `` Oh , he will see you , '' said the soldier who had taken her message to the Wizard , `` although he does not like to have people ask to see him STOP Indeed , at first he was angry , and said I should send you back where you came from STOP Then he asked me what you looked like , and when I mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested STOP At last I told him about the mark upon your forehead , and he decided he would admit you to his presence . STOP Just then a bell rang , and the green girl said to Dorothy , '' That is the signal STOP You must go into the Throne Room alone . STOP She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place STOP It was a big , round room with a high arched roof , and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together STOP In the center of the roof was a great light , as bright as the sun , which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner STOP But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room STOP It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems , as did everything else STOP In the center of the chair was an enormous Head , without body to support it or any arms or legs whatever STOP There was no hair upon this head , but it had eyes and nose and mouth , and was bigger than the head of the biggest giant STOP As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily STOP Then the mouth moved , and Dorothy heard a voice say : '' I am Oz , the Great and Terrible STOP Who are you , and why do you seek me ? STOP It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big Head ; so she took courage and answered , '' I am Dorothy , the Small and Meek STOP I have come to you for help . STOP The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute STOP Then said the voice : '' Where did you get the silver shoes ? STOP `` I got them from the wicked Witch of the East , when my house fell on her and killed her , '' she replied STOP `` Where did you get the mark upon your forehead ? STOP continued the voice STOP `` That is where the good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me good-bye and sent me to you , '' said the girl STOP Again the eyes looked at her sharply , and they saw she was telling the truth STOP Then Oz asked , '' What do you wish me to do ? STOP `` Send me back to Kansas , where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are , '' she answered , earnestly STOP `` I do n't like your country , although it is so beautiful STOP And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long . STOP The eyes winked three times , and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room STOP And at last they looked at Dorothy again STOP `` Why should I do this for you ? STOP asked Oz STOP `` Because you are strong and I am weak ; because you are a Great Wizard and I am only a helpless little girl , '' she answered STOP `` But you were strong enough to kill the wicked Witch of the East , '' said Oz STOP `` That just happened , '' returned Dorothy , simply ; `` I could not help it . STOP `` Well , '' said the Head , `` I will give you my answer STOP You have no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in return STOP In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets STOP If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first STOP Help me and I will help you . STOP `` What must I do ? STOP asked the girl STOP `` Kill the wicked Witch of the West , '' answered Oz STOP `` But I can not ! STOP exclaimed Dorothy , greatly surprised STOP `` You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes , which bear a powerful charm STOP There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all this land , and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to Kansas -- but not before . STOP The little girl began to weep , she was so much disappointed ; and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously , as if the Great Oz felt that she could help him if she would STOP `` I never killed anything , willingly , '' she sobbed ; `` and even if I wanted to , how could I kill the Wicked Witch STOP If you , who are Great and Terrible , can not kill her yourself , how do you expect me to do it ? STOP [ Illustration ] '' I do not know , '' said the Head ; `` but that is my answer , and until the Wicked Witch dies you will not see your Uncle and Aunt again STOP Remember that the Witch is Wicked -- tremendously Wicked -- and ought to be killed STOP Now go , and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task . STOP Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had said to her STOP `` There is no hope for me , '' she said , sadly , `` for Oz will not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West ; and that I can never do . STOP Her friends were sorry , but could do nothing to help her ; so she went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep STOP The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Scarecrow and said , '' Come with me , for Oz has sent for you . STOP So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne Room , where he saw , sitting in the emerald throne , a most lovely lady STOP She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels STOP Growing from her shoulders were wings , gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them STOP When the Scarecrow had bowed , as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him , before this beautiful creature , she looked upon him sweetly , and said , '' I am Oz , the Great and Terrible STOP Who are you , and why do you seek me ? STOP Now the Scarecrow , who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had told him of , was much astonished ; but he answered her bravely STOP `` I am only a Scarecrow , stuffed with straw STOP Therefore I have no brains , and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw , so that I may become as much a man as any other in your dominions . STOP `` Why should I do this for you ? STOP asked the lady STOP `` Because you are wise and powerful , and no one else can help me , '' answered the Scarecrow STOP `` I never grant favors without some return , '' said Oz ; `` but this much I will promise STOP If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West I will bestow upon you a great many brains , and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz . STOP `` I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch , '' said , the Scarecrow , in surprise STOP [ Illustration ] '' So I did STOP I do n't care who kills her STOP But until she is dead I will not grant your wish STOP Now go , and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire . STOP The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what Oz had said ; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the great Wizard was not a Head , as she had seen him , but a lovely lady STOP `` All the same , '' said the Scarecrow , `` she needs a heart as much as the Tin Woodman . STOP On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin Woodman and said , '' Oz has sent for you STOP Follow me , '' So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room STOP He did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely lady or a Head , but he hoped it would be the lovely lady STOP `` For , '' he said to himself , `` if it is the Head , I am sure I shall not be given a heart , since a head has no heart of its own and therefore can not feel for me STOP But if it is the lovely lady I shall beg hard for a heart , for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted . STOP But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the Head nor the Lady , for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast STOP It was nearly as big as an elephant , and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight STOP The Beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros , only there were five eyes in its face STOP There were five long arms growing out of its body and it also had five long , slim legs STOP Thick , woolly hair covered every part of it , and a more dreadful looking monster could not be imagined STOP It was fortunate the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment , for it would have beat loud and fast from terror STOP But being only tin , the Woodman was not at all afraid , although he was much disappointed STOP `` I am Oz , the Great and Terrible , '' spake the Beast , in a voice that was one great roar STOP `` Who are you , and why do you seek me ? STOP [ Illustration : `` _The Eyes looked at her thoughtfully._ '' ] '' I am a Woodman , and made of tin STOP Therefore I have no heart , and can not love STOP I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are . STOP `` Why should I do this ? STOP demanded the Beast STOP `` Because I ask it , and you alone can grant my request , '' answered the Woodman STOP Oz gave a low growl at this , but said , gruffly , '' If you indeed desire a heart , you must earn it . STOP `` How ? STOP asked the Woodman STOP `` Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West , '' replied the Beast STOP `` When the Witch is dead , come to me , and I will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz . STOP So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen STOP They all wondered greatly at the many forms the great Wizard could take upon himself , and the Lion said , [ Illustration ] '' If he is a beast when I go to see him , I shall roar my loudest , and so frighten him that he will grant all I ask STOP And if he is the lovely lady , I shall pretend to spring upon her , and so compel her to do my bidding STOP And if he is the great Head , he will be at my mercy ; for I will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire STOP So be of good cheer my friends for all will yet be well . STOP The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to the great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz STOP The Lion at once passed through the door , and glancing around saw , to his surprise , that before the throne was a Ball of Fire , so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it STOP His first thought was that Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up ; but , when he tried to go nearer , the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers , and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door STOP Then a low , quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire , and these were the words it spoke : [ Illustration ] '' I am Oz , the Great and Terrible STOP Who are you , and why do you seek me ? STOP And the Lion answered , '' I am a Cowardly Lion , afraid of everything STOP I come to you to beg that you give me courage , so that in reality I may become the King of Beasts , as men call me . STOP `` Why should I give you courage ? STOP demanded Oz STOP `` Because of all Wizards you are the greatest , and alone have power to grant my request , '' answered the Lion STOP The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time , and the voice said , '' Bring me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead , and that moment I will give you courage STOP But so long as the Witch lives you must remain a coward . STOP The Lion was angry at this speech , but could say nothing in reply , and while he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room STOP He was glad to find his friends waiting for him , and told them of his terrible interview with the Wizard STOP `` What shall we do now ? STOP asked Dorothy , sadly STOP `` There is only one thing we can do , '' returned the Lion , `` and that is to go to the land of the Winkies , seek out the Wicked Witch , and destroy her . STOP `` But suppose we can not ? STOP said the girl STOP `` Then I shall never have courage , '' declared the Lion STOP `` And I shall never have brains , '' added the Scarecrow STOP `` And I shall never have a heart , '' spoke the Tin Woodman STOP `` And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry , '' said Dorothy , beginning to cry STOP `` Be careful ! STOP cried the green girl , `` the tears will fall on your green silk gown , and spot it . STOP So Dorothy dried her eyes and said , '' I suppose we must try it ; but I am sure I do not want to kill anybody , even to see Aunt Em again . STOP `` I will go with you ; but I 'm too much of a coward to kill the Witch , '' said the Lion STOP `` I will go too , '' declared the Scarecrow ; `` but I shall not be of much help to you , I am such a fool . STOP `` I have n't the heart to harm even a Witch , '' remarked the Tin Woodman ; '' but if you go I certainly shall go with you . STOP Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning , and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled STOP The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better STOP The green girl , who was very kind to them , filled Dorothy's basket with good things to eat , and fastened a little bell around Toto 's neck with a green ribbon STOP They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight , when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the palace , and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg STOP [ Illustration : `` _The Soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets._ '' ] STOP The Search for the Wicked Witch STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived STOP This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box , and then he politely opened the gate for our friends STOP `` Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` There is no road , '' answered the Guardian of the Gates ; `` no one ever wishes to go that way . STOP `` How , then , are we to find her ? STOP enquired the girl STOP [ Illustration ] '' That will be easy , '' replied the man ; `` for when she knows you are in the Country of the Winkies she will find you , and make you all her slaves . STOP `` Perhaps not , '' said the Scarecrow , `` for we mean to destroy her . STOP [ Illustration ] '' Oh , that is different , '' said the Guardian of the Gates STOP `` No one has ever destroyed her before , so I naturally thought she would make slaves of you , as she has of all the rest STOP But take care ; for she is wicked and fierce , and may not allow you to destroy her STOP Keep to the West , where the sun sets , and you can not fail to find her . STOP They thanked him and bade him good-bye , and turned toward the West , walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups STOP Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace , but now , to her surprise , she found it was no longer green , but pure white STOP The ribbon around Toto 's neck had also lost its green color and was as white as Dorothy 's dress STOP The Emerald City was soon left far behind STOP As they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier , for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the West , and the ground was untilled STOP In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces , for there were no trees to offer them shade ; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were tired , and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep , with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch STOP Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye , yet that was as powerful as a telescope , and could see everywhere STOP So , as she sat in the door of her castle , she happened to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep , with her friends all about her STOP They were a long distance off , but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country ; so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck STOP At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves STOP They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth STOP `` Go to those people , '' said the Witch , `` and tear them to pieces . STOP `` Are you not going to make them your slaves ? STOP asked the leader of the wolves STOP `` No , '' she answered , `` one is of tin , and one of straw ; one is a girl and another a Lion STOP None of them is fit to work , so you may tear them into small pieces . STOP `` Very well , '' said the wolf , and he dashed away at full speed , followed by the others STOP It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming STOP `` This is my fight , '' said the Woodman ; `` so get behind me and I will meet them as they come . STOP He seized his axe , which he had made very sharp , and as the leader of the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf 's head from its body , so that it immediately died STOP As soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up , and he also fell under the sharp edge of the Tin Woodman 's weapon STOP There were forty wolves , and forty times a wolf was killed ; so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman STOP Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow , who said , '' It was a good fight , friend . STOP They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning STOP The little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves , but the Tin Woodman told her all STOP She thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast , after which they started again upon their journey STOP [ Illustration ] Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see afar off STOP She saw all her wolves lying dead , and the strangers still travelling through her country STOP This made her angrier than before , and she blew her silver whistle twice STOP Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her , enough to darken the sky STOP And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow , '' Fly at once to the strangers ; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces . STOP The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her companions STOP When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid STOP But the Scarecrow said , '' This is my battle ; so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed . STOP So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow , and he stood up and stretched out his arms STOP And when the crows saw him they were frightened , as these birds always are by scarecrows , and did not dare to come any nearer STOP But the King Crow said , '' It is only a stuffed man STOP I will peck his eyes out . STOP The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow , who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died STOP And then another crow flew at him , and the Scarecrow twisted its neck also STOP There were forty crows , and forty times the Scarecrow twisted a neck , until at last all were lying dead beside him STOP Then he called to his companions to rise , and again they went upon their journey STOP When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap , she got into a terrible rage , and blew three times upon her silver whistle STOP [ Illustration ] Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air , and a swarm of black bees came flying towards her STOP `` Go to the strangers and sting them to death ! STOP commanded the Witch , and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and her friends were walking STOP But the Woodman had seen them coming and the Scarecrow had decided what to do STOP `` Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the lion , '' he said to the Woodman , `` and the bees can not sting them . STOP This the Woodman did , and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held Toto in her arms , the straw covered them entirely STOP The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting , so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin , without hurting the Woodman at all STOP And as bees can not live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees , and they lay scattered thick about the Woodman , like little heaps of fine coal STOP Then Dorothy and the Lion got up , and the girl helped the Tin Woodman put the straw back into the Scarecrow again , until he was as good as ever STOP So they started upon their journey once more STOP The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth STOP And then she called a dozen of her slaves , who were the Winkies , and gave them sharp spears , telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them STOP The Winkies were not a brave people , but they had to do as they were told ; so they marched away until they came near to Dorothy STOP Then the Lion gave a great roar and sprang toward them , and the poor Winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could STOP When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a strap , and sent them back to their work , after which she sat down to think what she should do next STOP She could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed ; but she was a powerful Witch , as well as a wicked one , and she soon made up her mind how to act STOP [ Illustration ] There was , in her cupboard , a Golden Cap , with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it STOP This Golden Cap had a charm STOP Whoever owned it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys , who would obey any order they were given STOP But no person could command these strange creatures more than three times STOP Twice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of the Cap STOP Once was when she had made the Winkies her slaves , and set herself to rule over their country STOP The Winged Monkeys had helped her do this STOP The second time was when she had fought against the Great Oz himself , and driven him out of the land of the West STOP The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this STOP Only once more could she use this Golden Cap , for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted STOP But now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone , and her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion , she saw there was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends STOP [ Illustration ] So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head STOP Then she stood upon her left foot and said , slowly , `` Ep-pe , pep-pe , kak-ke ! STOP Next she stood upon her right foot and said , `` Hil-lo , hol-lo , hel-lo ! STOP After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice , '' Ziz-zy , zuz-zy , zik ! STOP Now the charm began to work STOP The sky was darkened , and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air STOP There was a rushing of many wings ; a great chattering and laughing ; and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys , each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders STOP One , much bigger than the others , seemed to be their leader STOP He flew close to the Witch and said , '' You have called us for the third and last time STOP What do you command ? STOP `` Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the Lion , '' said the Wicked Witch STOP `` Bring that beast to me , for I have a mind to harness him like a horse , and make him work . STOP `` Your commands shall be obeyed , '' said the leader ; and then , with a great deal of chattering and noise , the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place where Dorothy and her friends were walking STOP [ Illustration ] Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks STOP Here they dropped the poor Woodman , who fell a great distance to the rocks , where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan STOP Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow , and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head STOP They made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree STOP The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs , until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way STOP Then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the Witch 's castle , where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it , so that he could not escape STOP But Dorothy they did not harm at all STOP She stood , with Toto in her arms , watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn STOP The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her , his long , hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly ; but he saw the mark of the Good Witch 's kiss upon her forehead and stopped short , motioning the others not to touch her STOP [ Illustration : `` _The Monkeys wound many coils about his body._ '' ] '' We dare not harm this little girl , '' he said to them , `` for she is protected by the Power of Good , and that is greater than the Power of Evil STOP All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch and leave her there . STOP So , carefully and gently , they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle , where they set her down upon the front door step STOP Then the leader said to the Witch , '' We have obeyed you as far as we were able STOP The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow are destroyed , and the Lion is tied up in your yard STOP The little girl we dare not harm , nor the dog she carries in her arms STOP Your power over our band is now ended , and you will never see us again . STOP Then all the Winged Monkeys , with much laughing and chattering and noise , flew into the air and were soon out of sight STOP [ Illustration ] The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on Dorothy 's forehead , for she knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys nor she , herself , dare hurt the girl in any way STOP She looked down at Dorothy 's feet , and seeing the Silver Shoes , began to tremble with fear , for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them STOP At first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy ; but she happened to look into the child 's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was , and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the Silver Shoes gave her STOP So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself , and thought , `` I can still make her my slave , for she does not know how to use her power . STOP Then she said to Dorothy , harshly and severely , '' Come with me ; and see that you mind everything I tell you , for if you do not I will make an end of you , as I did of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow . STOP Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen , where the Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood STOP Dorothy went to work meekly , with her mind made up to work as hard as she could ; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill her STOP With Dorothy hard at work the Witch thought she would go into the court-yard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse ; it would amuse her , she was sure , to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive STOP But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid , and ran out and shut the gate again STOP `` If I can not harness you , '' said the Witch to the Lion , speaking through the bars of the gate , `` I can starve you STOP You shall have nothing to eat until you do as I wish . STOP So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion ; but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked , '' Are you ready to be harnessed like a horse ? STOP And the Lion would answer , '' No STOP If you come in this yard I will bite you . STOP The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that every night , while the woman was asleep Dorothy carried him food from the cupboard STOP After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw , and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft , shaggy mane , while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape STOP But they could find no way to get out of the castle , for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies , who were the slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them STOP The girl had to work hard during the day , and often the Witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand STOP But , in truth , she did not dare to strike Dorothy , because of the mark upon her forehead STOP The child did not know this , and was full of fear for herself and Toto STOP Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg , in return STOP The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten , for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before STOP Dorothy 's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again STOP Sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours , with Toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face , whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress STOP Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him ; but he knew the little girl was unhappy , and that made him unhappy too STOP Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wore STOP Her Bees and her Crows and her Wolves were lying in heaps and drying up , and she had used up all the power of the Golden Cap ; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost STOP She watched Dorothy carefully , to see if she ever took off her shoes , thinking she might steal them STOP But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath STOP The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in Dorothy 's room at night to take the shoes , and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark , so she never came near when Dorothy was bathing STOP Indeed , the old Witch never touched water , nor ever let water touch her in any way STOP But the wicked creature was very cunning , and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted STOP She placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor , and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes STOP So that when Dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar , not being able to see it , and fell at full length STOP She was not much hurt , but in her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off , and before she could reach it the Witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot STOP The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick , for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm , and Dorothy could not use it against her , even had she known how to do so STOP [ Illustration ] The little girl , seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes , grew angry , and said to the Witch , '' Give me back my shoe ! STOP `` I will not , '' retorted the Witch , `` for it is now my shoe , and not yours . STOP `` You are a wicked creature ! STOP cried Dorothy STOP `` You have no right to take my shoe from me . STOP `` I shall keep it , just the same , '' said the Witch , laughing at her , '' and some day I shall get the other one from you , too . STOP This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch , wetting her from head to foot STOP Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear ; and then , as Dorothy looked at her in wonder , the Witch began to shrink and fall away STOP `` See what you have done ! STOP she screamed STOP `` In a minute I shall melt away . STOP `` I 'm very sorry , indeed , '' said Dorothy , who was truly frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes STOP `` Did n't you know water would be the end of me ? STOP asked the Witch , in a wailing , despairing voice STOP `` Of course not , '' answered Dorothy ; `` how should I ? STOP `` Well , in a few minutes I shall be all melted , and you will have the castle to yourself STOP I have been wicked in my day , but I never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds STOP Look out -- here I go ! STOP With these words the Witch fell down in a brown , melted , shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor STOP Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing , Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess STOP She then swept it all out the door STOP After picking out the silver shoe , which was all that was left of the old woman , she cleaned and dried it with a cloth , and put it on her foot again STOP Then , being at last free to do as she chose , she ran out to the court-yard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end , and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land STOP [ Illustration ] STOP The Rescue [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had been melted by a bucket of water , and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free STOP They went in together to the castle , where Dorothy 's first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves STOP There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies , for they had been made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch , who had always treated them with great cruelty STOP They kept this day as a holiday , then and ever after , and spent the time in feasting and dancing STOP `` If our friends , the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman , were only with us , '' said the Lion , `` I should be quite happy . STOP `` Do n't you suppose we could rescue them ? STOP asked the girl , anxiously STOP `` We can try , '' answered the Lion STOP So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends , and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for Dorothy , who had set them free from bondage STOP So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they knew the most , and they all started away STOP They travelled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin Woodman lay , all battered and bent STOP His axe was near him , but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short STOP The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms , and carried him back to the yellow castle again , Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend , and the Lion looking sober and sorry STOP When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies , '' Are any of your people tinsmiths ? STOP `` Oh , yes ; some of us are very good tinsmiths , '' they told her STOP `` Then bring them to me , '' she said STOP And when the tinsmiths came , bringing with them all their tools in baskets , she enquired , [ Illustration : `` _The Tinsmiths worked for three days and four nights._ '' ] '' Can you straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman , and bend him back into shape again , and solder him together where he is broken ? STOP The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever STOP So they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights , hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman , until at last he was straightened out into his old form , and his joints worked as well as ever STOP To be sure , there were several patches on him , but the tinsmiths did a good job , and as the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all STOP When , at last , he walked into Dorothy 's room and thanked her for rescuing him , he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy , and Dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron , so his joints would not be rusted STOP At the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again , and these tears did not need to be wiped away STOP As for the Lion , he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet , and he was obliged to go out into the court-yard and hold it in the sun till it dried STOP `` If we only had the Scarecrow with us again , '' said the Tin Woodman , when Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened , '' I should be quite happy . STOP `` We must try to find him , '' said the girl STOP So she called the Winkies to help her , and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow 's clothes STOP It was a very tall tree , and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it ; but the Woodman said at once , '' I 'll chop it down , and then we can get the Scarecrow 's clothes . STOP Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself , another of the Winkies , who was a goldsmith , had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman 's axe , instead of the old broken handle STOP Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver STOP As soon as he had spoken , the Tin Woodman began to chop , and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash , when the Scarecrow's clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground STOP Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the castle , where they were stuffed with nice , clean straw ; and , behold STOP here was the Scarecrow , as good as ever , thanking them over and over again for saving him STOP Now they were reunited , Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the Yellow Castle , where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable STOP But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em , and said , '' We must go back to Oz , and claim his promise .

STOP `` Does n't anyone else know you 're a humbug ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` No one knows it but you four -- and myself , '' replied Oz STOP `` I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out STOP It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room STOP Usually I will not see even my subjects , and so they believe I am something terrible . STOP `` But , I do n't understand , '' said Dorothy , in bewilderment STOP `` How was it that you appeared to me as a great Head ? STOP `` That was one of my tricks , '' answered Oz STOP `` Step this way , please , and I will tell you all about it . STOP He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room , and they all followed him STOP He pointed to one corner , in which lay the Great Head , made out of many thicknesses of paper , and with a carefully painted face STOP `` This I hung from the ceiling by a wire , '' said Oz ; `` I stood behind the screen and pulled a thread , to make the eyes move and the mouth open . STOP `` But how about the voice ? STOP she enquired STOP `` Oh , I am a ventriloquist , '' said the little man , `` and I can throw the sound of my voice wherever I wish ; so that you thought it was coming out of the Head STOP Here are the other things I used to deceive you . STOP He showed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely Lady ; and the Tin Woodman saw that his Terrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins , sewn together , with slats to keep their sides out STOP As for the Ball of Fire , the false Wizard had hung that also from the ceiling STOP It was really a ball of cotton , but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely STOP `` Really , '' said the Scarecrow , `` you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug . STOP `` I am -- I certainly am , '' answered the little man , sorrowfully ; `` but it was the only thing I could do STOP Sit down , please , there are plenty of chairs ; and I will tell you my story . STOP So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale : '' I was born in Omaha -- '' '' Why , that is n't very far from Kansas ! STOP cried Dorothy STOP `` No ; but it 's farther from here , '' he said , shaking his head at her , sadly STOP `` When I grew up I became a ventriloquist , and at that I was very well trained by a great master STOP I can imitate any kind of a bird or beast . STOP Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was STOP `` After a time , '' continued Oz , `` I tired of that , and became a balloonist . STOP `` What is that ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day , so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus , '' he explained STOP [ Illustration ] '' Oh , '' she said ; `` I know . STOP `` Well , one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted , so that I could n't come down again STOP It went way up above the clouds , so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many , many miles away STOP For a day and a night I travelled through the air , and on the morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country STOP `` It came down gradually , and I was not hurt a bit STOP But I found myself in the midst of a strange people , who , seeing me come from the clouds , thought I was a great Wizard STOP Of course I let them think so , because they were afraid of me , and promised to do anything I wished them to STOP `` Just to amuse myself , and keep the good people busy , I ordered them to build this City , and my palace ; and they did it all willingly and well STOP Then I thought , as the country was so green and beautiful , I would call it the Emerald City , and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people , so that everything they saw was green . STOP `` But is n't everything here green ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` No more than in any other city , '' replied Oz ; `` but when you wear green spectacles , why of course everything you see looks green to you STOP The Emerald City was built a great many years ago , for I was a young man when the balloon brought me here , and I am a very old man now STOP But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an Emerald City , and it certainly is a beautiful place , abounding in jewels and precious metals , and every good thing that is needed to make one happy STOP I have been good to the people , and they like me ; but ever since this Palace was built I have shut myself up and would not see any of them STOP `` One of my greatest fears was the Witches , for while I had no magical powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do wonderful things STOP There were four of them in this country , and they ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West STOP Fortunately , the Witches of the North and South were good , and I knew they would do me no harm ; but the Witches of the East and West were terribly wicked , and had they not thought I was more powerful than they themselves , they would surely have destroyed me STOP As it was , I lived in deadly fear of them for many years ; so you can imagine how pleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East STOP When you came to me I was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other Witch ; but , now that you have melted her , I am ashamed to say that I can not keep my promises . STOP `` I think you are a very bad man , '' said Dorothy STOP `` Oh , no , my dear ; I 'm really a very good man ; but I 'm a very bad Wizard , I must admit . STOP `` Ca n't you give me brains ?

STOP asked the Lion , anxiously STOP `` You have plenty of courage , I am sure , '' answered Oz STOP `` All you need is confidence in yourself STOP There is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger STOP True courage is in facing danger when you are afraid , and that kind of courage you have in plenty . STOP `` Perhaps I have , but I 'm scared just the same , '' said the Lion STOP `` I shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid . STOP `` Very well ; I will give you that sort of courage to-morrow , '' replied Oz STOP `` How about my heart ? STOP asked the Tin Woodman STOP `` Why , as for that , '' answered Oz , `` I think you are wrong to want a heart STOP It makes most people unhappy STOP If you only knew it , you are in luck not to have a heart . STOP `` That must be a matter of opinion , '' said the Tin Woodman STOP `` For my part , I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur , if you will give me the heart . STOP [ Illustration ] '' Very well , '' answered Oz , meekly STOP `` Come to me to-morrow and you shall have a heart STOP I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well continue the part a little longer . STOP `` And now , '' said Dorothy , `` how am I to get back to Kansas ? STOP `` We shall have to think about that , '' replied the little man , `` Give me two or three days to consider the matter and I 'll try to find a way to carry you over the desert STOP In the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests , and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish STOP There is only one thing I ask in return for my help -- such as it is STOP You must keep my secret and tell no one I am a humbug . STOP They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned , and went back to their rooms in high spirits STOP Even Dorothy had hope that `` The Great and Terrible Humbug , '' as she called him , would find a way to send her back to Kansas , and if he did that she was willing to forgive him everything STOP [ Illustration ] STOP The Magic Art of the Great Humbug STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] Next morning the Scarecrow said to his friends : '' Congratulate me STOP I am going to Oz to get my brains at last STOP When I return I shall be as other men are . STOP `` I have always liked you as you were , '' said Dorothy , simply STOP `` It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow , '' he replied STOP `` But surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out . STOP Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the Throne Room , where he rapped upon the door STOP `` Come in , '' said Oz STOP The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window , engaged in deep thought STOP `` I have come for my brains , '' remarked the Scarecrow , a little uneasily STOP `` Oh , yes ; sit down in that chair , please , '' replied Oz STOP `` You must excuse me for taking your head off , but I shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place . STOP `` That 's all right , '' said the Scarecrow STOP `` You are quite welcome to take my head off , as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again . STOP So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw STOP Then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran , which he mixed with a great many pins and needles STOP Having shaken them together thoroughly , he filled the top of the Scarecrow 's head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw , to hold it in place STOP When he had fastened the Scarecrow 's head on his body again he said to him , '' Hereafter you will be a great man , for I have given you a lot of bran-new brains . STOP The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish , and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his friends STOP Dorothy looked at him curiously STOP His head was quite bulging out at the top with brains STOP `` How do you feel ? STOP she asked STOP [ Illustration : `` _ ' I feel wise , indeed , ' said the Scarecrow._ '' ] '' I feel wise , indeed , '' he answered , earnestly STOP `` When I get used to my brains I shall know everything . STOP `` Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head ? STOP asked the Tin Woodman STOP `` That is proof that he is sharp , '' remarked the Lion STOP `` Well , I must go to Oz and get my heart , '' said the Woodman STOP So he walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door STOP `` Come in , '' called Oz , and the Woodman entered and said , '' I have come for my heart . STOP `` Very well , '' answered the little man STOP `` But I shall have to cut a hole in your breast , so I can put your heart in the right place STOP I hope it wo n't hurt you . STOP `` Oh , no ; '' answered the Woodman STOP `` I shall not feel it at all . STOP [ Illustration ] So Oz brought a pair of tinners ' shears and cut a small , square hole in the left side of the Tin Woodman 's breast STOP Then , going to a chest of drawers , he took out a pretty heart , made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust STOP `` Is n't it a beauty ? STOP he asked STOP `` It is , indeed ! STOP replied the Woodman , who was greatly pleased STOP `` But is it a kind heart ? STOP `` Oh , very ! STOP answered Oz STOP He put the heart in the Woodman 's breast and then replaced the square of tin , soldering it neatly together where it had been cut STOP `` There , '' said he ; `` now you have a heart that any man might be proud of STOP I 'm sorry I had to put a patch on your breast , but it really could n't be helped . STOP `` Never mind the patch , '' exclaimed the happy Woodman STOP `` I am very grateful to you , and shall never forget your kindness . STOP [ Illustration ] '' Do n't speak of it , '' replied Oz STOP Then the Tin Woodman went back to his friends , who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune STOP The Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door STOP `` Come in , '' said Oz STOP `` I have come for my courage , '' announced the Lion , entering the room STOP `` Very well , '' answered the little man ; `` I will get it for you . STOP He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle , the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish , beautifully carved STOP Placing this before the Cowardly Lion , who sniffed at it as if he did not like it , the Wizard said , '' Drink . STOP `` What is it ? STOP asked the Lion STOP `` Well , '' answered Oz , `` if it were inside of you , it would be courage STOP You know , of course , that courage is always inside one ; so that this really can not be called courage until you have swallowed it STOP Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible . STOP The Lion hesitated no longer , but drank till the dish was empty STOP `` How do you feel now ? STOP asked Oz STOP `` Full of courage , '' replied the Lion , who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune STOP Oz , left to himself , smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted STOP `` How can I help being a humbug , '' he said , `` when all these people make me do things that everybody knows ca n't be done STOP It was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy , because they imagined I could do anything STOP But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas , and I 'm sure I don't know how it can be done . STOP STOP How the Balloon was Launched STOP [ Illustration ] For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz STOP These were sad days for the little girl , although her friends were all quite happy and contented STOP The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head ; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself STOP When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast ; and he told Dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh STOP The Lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth , and would gladly face an army of men or a dozen of the fierce Kalidahs STOP Thus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy , who longed more than ever to get back to Kansas STOP On the fourth day , to her great joy , Oz sent for her , and when she entered the Throne Room he said , pleasantly : '' Sit down , my dear ; I think I have found the way to get you out of this country . STOP `` And back to Kansas ? STOP she asked , eagerly STOP `` Well , I 'm not sure about Kansas , '' said Oz ; `` for I have n't the faintest notion which way it lies STOP But the first thing to do is to cross the desert , and then it should be easy to find your way home . STOP `` How can I cross the desert ? STOP she enquired STOP `` Well , I 'll tell you what I think , '' said the little man STOP `` You see , when I came to this country it was in a balloon STOP You also came through the air , being carried by a cyclone STOP So I believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air STOP Now , it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone ; but I 've been thinking the matter over , and I believe I can make a balloon . STOP `` How ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` A balloon , '' said Oz , `` is made of silk , which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it STOP I have plenty of silk in the Palace , so it will be no trouble for us to make the balloon STOP But in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with , to make it float . STOP `` If it wo n't float , '' remarked Dorothy , `` it will be of no use to us . STOP `` True , '' answered Oz STOP `` But there is another way to make it float , which is to fill it with hot air STOP Hot air is n't as good as gas , for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert , and we should be lost . STOP `` We ! STOP exclaimed the girl ; `` are you going with me ? STOP `` Yes , of course , '' replied Oz STOP `` I am tired of being such a humbug STOP If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a Wizard , and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them STOP So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day , and it gets tiresome STOP I 'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again . STOP [ Illustration ] '' I shall be glad to have your company , '' said Dorothy STOP `` Thank you , '' he answered STOP `` Now , if you will help me sew the silk together , we will begin to work on our balloon . STOP So Dorothy took a needle and thread , and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together STOP First there was a strip of light green silk , then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green ; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them STOP It took three days to sew all the strips together , but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long STOP Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue , to make it air-tight , after which he announced that the balloon was ready STOP `` But we must have a basket to ride in , '' he said STOP So he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket , which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon STOP When it was all ready , Oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds STOP The news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight STOP Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace , and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity STOP The Tin Woodman had chopped a big pile of wood , and now he made a fire of it , and Oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag STOP Gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air , until finally the basket just touched the ground STOP Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice : '' I am now going away to make a visit STOP While I am gone the Scarecrow will rule over you STOP I command you to obey him as you would me . STOP The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground , for the air within it was hot , and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky STOP `` Come , Dorothy ! STOP cried the Wizard ; `` hurry up , or the balloon will fly away . STOP `` I ca n't find Toto anywhere , '' replied Dorothy , who did not wish to leave her little dog behind STOP Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten , and Dorothy at last found him STOP She picked him up and ran toward the balloon STOP [ Illustration ] She was within a few steps of it , and Oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket , when , crack STOP went the ropes , and the balloon rose into the air without her STOP [ Illustration ] '' Come back ! STOP she screamed ; `` I want to go , too ! STOP `` I ca n't come back , my dear , '' called Oz from the basket STOP `` Good-bye ! STOP `` Good-bye ! STOP shouted everyone , and all eyes were turned upward to where the Wizard was riding in the basket , rising every moment farther and farther into the sky STOP And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz , the Wonderful Wizard , though he may have reached Omaha safely , and be there now , for all we know STOP But the people remembered him lovingly , and said to one another , '' Oz was always our friend STOP When he was here he built for us this beautiful Emerald City , and now he is gone he has left the Wise Scarecrow to rule over us . STOP Still , for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful Wizard , and would not be comforted STOP STOP Away to the South STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] Dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas again ; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon STOP And she also felt sorry at losing Oz , and so did her companions STOP The Tin Woodman came to her and said , '' Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart STOP I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone , if you will kindly wipe away my tears , so that I shall not rust . STOP [ Illustration ] '' With pleasure , '' she answered , and brought a towel at once STOP Then the Tin Woodman wept for several minutes , and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel STOP When he had finished he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jewelled oil-can , to guard against mishap STOP The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City , and although he was not a Wizard the people were proud of him STOP `` For , '' they said , '' there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man . STOP And , so far as they knew , they were quite right STOP The morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz the four travellers met in the Throne Room and talked matters over STOP The Scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him STOP `` We are not so unlucky , '' said the new ruler ; `` for this Palace and the Emerald City belong to us , and we can do just as we please STOP When I remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer's cornfield , and that I am now the ruler of this beautiful City , I am quite satisfied with my lot . STOP `` I also , '' said the Tin Woodman , `` am well pleased with my new heart ; and , really , that was the only thing I wished in all the world . STOP `` For my part , I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that ever lived , if not braver , '' said the Lion , modestly , [ Illustration : `` _The Scarecrow sat on the big throne._ '' ] '' If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City , '' continued the Scarecrow , `` we might all be happy together . STOP `` But I do n't want to live here , '' cried Dorothy STOP `` I want to go to Kansas , and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry . STOP `` Well , then , what can be done ? STOP enquired the Woodman STOP The Scarecrow decided to think , and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains STOP Finally he said : '' Why not call the Winged Monkeys , and asked them to carry you over the desert ? STOP `` I never thought of that ! STOP said Dorothy , joyfully STOP `` It 's just the thing STOP I 'll go at once for the Golden Cap . STOP When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words , and soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through an open window and stood beside her STOP `` This is the second time you have called us , '' said the Monkey King , bowing before the little girl STOP `` What do you wish ? STOP `` I want you to fly with me to Kansas , '' said Dorothy STOP But the Monkey King shook his head STOP `` That can not be done , '' he said STOP `` We belong to this country alone , and can not leave it STOP There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet , and I suppose there never will be , for they do n't belong there STOP We shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power , but we can not cross the desert STOP Good-bye . STOP And with another bow the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away through the window , followed by all his band STOP Dorothy was almost ready to cry with disappointment STOP `` I have wasted the charm of the Golden Cap to no purpose , '' she said , '' for the Winged Monkeys can not help me . STOP `` It is certainly too bad ! STOP said the tender hearted Woodman STOP The Scarecrow was thinking again , and his head bulged out so horribly that Dorothy feared it would burst STOP `` Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers , '' he said , `` and ask his advice . STOP [ Illustration ] So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly , for while Oz was alive he never was allowed to come further than the door STOP `` This little girl , '' said the Scarecrow to the soldier , `` wishes to cross the desert STOP How can she do so ? STOP `` I can not tell , '' answered the soldier ; `` for nobody has ever crossed the desert , unless it is Oz himself . STOP `` Is there no one who can help me ? STOP asked Dorothy , earnestly STOP `` Glinda might , '' he suggested STOP `` Who is Glinda ? STOP enquired the Scarecrow STOP `` The Witch of the South STOP She is the most powerful of all the Witches , and rules over the Quadlings STOP Besides , her castle stands on the edge of the desert , so she may know a way to cross it . STOP `` Glinda is a good Witch , is n't she ? STOP asked the child STOP `` The Quadlings think she is good , '' said the soldier , `` and she is kind to everyone STOP I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman , who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived . STOP `` How can I get to her castle ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` The road is straight to the South , '' he answered , `` but it is said to be full of dangers to travellers STOP There are wild beasts in the woods , and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country STOP For this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City . STOP The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said , '' It seems , in spite of dangers , that the best thing Dorothy can do is to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her STOP For , of course , if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas . STOP `` You must have been thinking again , '' remarked the Tin Woodman STOP `` I have , '' said the Scarecrow STOP `` I shall go with Dorothy , '' declared the Lion , `` for I am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again STOP I am really a wild beast , you know STOP Besides , Dorothy will need someone to protect her . STOP `` That is true , '' agreed the Woodman STOP `` My axe may be of service to her ; so I , also , will go with her to the Land of the South . STOP `` When shall we start ? STOP asked the Scarecrow STOP `` Are you going ? STOP they asked , in surprise STOP `` Certainly STOP If it was n't for Dorothy I should never have had brains STOP She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the Emerald City STOP So my good luck is all due to her , and I shall never leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all . STOP `` Thank you , '' said Dorothy , gratefully STOP `` You are all very kind to me STOP But I should like to start as soon as possible . STOP `` We shall go to-morrow morning , '' returned the Scarecrow STOP `` So now let us all get ready , for it will be a long journey . STOP [ Illustration ] STOP Attacked by the Fighting Trees STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye , and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers , who had walked with them as far as the gate STOP When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble STOP But he at once unlocked their spectacles , which he put back into the green box , and gave them many good wishes to carry with them STOP `` You are now our ruler , '' he said to the Scarecrow ; `` so you must come back to us as soon as possible . STOP `` I certainly shall if I am able , '' the Scarecrow replied ; `` but I must help Dorothy to get home , first . STOP As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said , '' I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City , and everyone has been good to me STOP I can not tell you how grateful I am . STOP `` Do n't try , my dear , '' he answered STOP `` We should like to keep you with us , but if it is your wish to return to Kansas I hope you will find a way . STOP He then opened the gate of the outer wall and they walked forth and started upon their journey STOP The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the Land of the South STOP They were all in the best of spirits , and laughed and chatted together STOP Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home , and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of use to her STOP As for the Lion , he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again , while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies , barking merrily all the time STOP `` City life does not agree with me at all , '' remarked the Lion , as they walked along at a brisk pace STOP `` I have lost much flesh since I lived there , and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous I have grown . STOP [ Illustration : `` _The branches bent down and twined around him._ '' ] They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City STOP All they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls , and high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz STOP `` Oz was not such a bad Wizard , after all , '' said the Tin Woodman , as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast STOP `` He knew how to give me brains , and very good brains , too , '' said the Scarecrow STOP `` If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me , '' added the Lion , `` he would have been a brave man . STOP Dorothy said nothing STOP Oz had not kept the promise he made her , but he had done his best , so she forgave him STOP As he said , he was a good man , even if he was a bad Wizard STOP The first day 's journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the Emerald City on every side STOP They slept that night on the grass , with nothing but the stars over them ; and they rested very well indeed STOP In the morning they travelled on until they came to a thick wood STOP There was no way of going around it , for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see ; and , besides , they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost STOP So they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest STOP The Scarecrow , who was in the lead , finally discovered a big tree with such wide spreading-branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath STOP So he walked forward to the tree , but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him , and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travellers STOP This did not hurt the Scarecrow , but it surprised him , and he looked rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up STOP `` Here is another space between the trees , '' called the Lion STOP [ Illustration ] '' Let me try it first , '' said the Scarecrow , `` for it does n't hurt me to get thrown about . STOP He walked up to another tree , as he spoke , but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again STOP `` This is strange , '' exclaimed Dorothy ; `` what shall we do ? STOP `` The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us , and stop our journey , '' remarked the Lion STOP `` I believe I will try it myself , '' said the Woodman , and shouldering his axe he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so roughly STOP When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two STOP At once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain , and the Tin Woodman passed safely under it STOP `` Come on ! STOP he shouted to the others ; `` be quick ! STOP They all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury , except Toto , who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled STOP But the Woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free STOP The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back , so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches , and that probably these were the policemen of the forest , and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it STOP The four travellers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the further edge of the wood STOP Then , to their surprise , they found before them a high wall , which seemed to be made of white china STOP It was smooth , like the surface of a dish , and higher than their heads STOP `` What shall we do now ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP `` I will make a ladder , '' said the Tin Woodman , `` for we certainly must climb over the wall . STOP STOP The Dainty China Country STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] While the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest Dorothy lay down and slept , for she was tired by the long walk STOP The Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him STOP The Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked , and said to him : '' I can not think why this wall is here , nor what it is made of . STOP `` Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall , '' replied the Woodman ; `` when we have climbed over it we shall know what is on the other side . STOP After a time the ladder was finished STOP It looked clumsy , but the Tin Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose STOP The Scarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto , and told them that the ladder was ready STOP The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first , but he was so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off STOP When he got his head over the top of the wall the Scarecrow said , '' Oh , my ! STOP `` Go on , '' exclaimed Dorothy STOP So the Scarecrow climbed further up and sat down on the top of the wall , and Dorothy put her head over and cried , '' Oh , my ! STOP just as the Scarecrow had done STOP Then Toto came up , and immediately began to bark , but Dorothy made him be still STOP The Lion climbed the ladder next , and the Tin Woodman came last ; but both of them cried , `` Oh , my ! STOP as soon as they looked over the wall STOP When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall they looked down and saw a strange sight STOP [ Illustration : `` _These people were all made of china._ '' ] Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter STOP Scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colours STOP These houses were quite small , the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothy 's waist STOP There were also pretty little barns , with china fences around them , and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens , all made of china , were standing about in groups STOP But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country STOP There were milk-maids and shepherdesses , with bright-colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns ; and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple ; and shepherds dressed in knee-breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them , and golden buckles on their shoes ; and princes with jewelled crowns upon their heads , wearing ermine robes and satin doublets ; and funny clowns in ruffled gowns , with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall , pointed caps STOP And , strangest of all , these people were all made of china , even to their clothes , and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than Dorothy 's knee STOP No one did so much as look at the travellers at first , except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head , which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice , afterwards running away again STOP `` How shall we get down ? STOP asked Dorothy STOP They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up , so the Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet STOP Of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet STOP When all were safely down they picked up the Scarecrow , whose body was quite flattened out , and patted his straw into shape again STOP `` We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side , '' said Dorothy ; `` for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due South . STOP They began walking through the country of the china people , and the first thing they came to was a china milk-maid milking a china cow STOP As they drew near the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool , the pail , and even the milk-maid herself , all falling on the china ground with a great clatter STOP Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg short off , and that the pail was lying in several small pieces , while the poor milk-maid had a nick in her left elbow STOP `` There ! STOP cried the milk-maid , angrily ; `` see what you have done STOP My cow has broken her leg , and I must take her to the mender 's shop and have it glued on again STOP What do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow ? STOP `` I 'm very sorry , '' returned Dorothy ; `` please forgive us . STOP But the pretty milk-maid was much too vexed to make any answer STOP She picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away , the poor animal limping on three legs STOP As she left them the milk-maid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers , holding her nicked elbow close to her side STOP [ Illustration ] Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap STOP `` We must be very careful here , '' said the kind-hearted Woodman , `` or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it . STOP A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautiful dressed young princess , who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away STOP Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess , so she ran after her ; but the china girl cried out , '' Do n't chase me STOP do n't chase me ! STOP She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said , '' Why not ? STOP `` Because , '' answered the princess , also stopping , a safe distance away , `` if I run I may fall down and break myself . STOP `` But could n't you be mended ? STOP asked the girl STOP `` Oh , yes ; but one is never so pretty after being mended , you know , '' replied the princess STOP `` I suppose not , '' said Dorothy STOP `` Now there is Mr. Joker , one of our clowns , '' continued the china lady , `` who is always trying to stand upon his head STOP He has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places , and doesn't look at all pretty STOP Here he comes now , so you can see for yourself . STOP Indeed , a jolly little Clown now came walking toward them , and Dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks , running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places STOP The Clown put his hands in his pockets , and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily he said , `` My lady fair , Why do you stare At poor old Mr. Joker STOP You 're quite as stiff And prim as if You 'd eaten up a poker ! STOP `` Be quiet , sir ! STOP said the princess ; `` ca n't you see these are strangers , and should be treated with respect ? STOP `` Well , that 's respect , I expect , '' declared the Clown , and immediately stood upon his head STOP `` Do n't mind Mr. Joker , '' said the princess to Dorothy ; `` he is considerably cracked in his head , and that makes him foolish . STOP [ Illustration ] '' Oh , I do n't mind him a bit , '' said Dorothy STOP `` But you are so beautiful , '' she continued , `` that I am sure I could love you dearly STOP Wo n't you let me carry you back to Kansas and stand you on Aunt Em's mantle-shelf STOP I could carry you in my basket . STOP `` That would make me very unhappy , '' answered the china princess STOP `` You see , here in our own country we live contentedly , and can talk and move around as we please STOP But whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen , and we can only stand straight and look pretty STOP Of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantle-shelves and cabinets and drawing-room tables , but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country . STOP `` I would not make you unhappy for all the world ! STOP exclaimed Dorothy ; '' so I 'll just say good-bye . STOP `` Good-bye , '' replied the princess STOP They walked carefully through the china country STOP The little animals and all the people scampered out of their way , fearing the strangers would break them , and after an hour or so the travellers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall STOP It was not as high as the first , however , and by standing upon the Lion 's back they all managed to scramble to the top STOP Then the Lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall ; but just as he jumped he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces STOP `` That was too bad , '' said Dorothy , `` but really I think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow 's leg and a church STOP They are all so brittle ! STOP `` They are , indeed , '' said the Scarecrow , `` and I am thankful I am made of straw and can not be easily damaged STOP There are worse things in the world than being a Scarecrow . STOP STOP The Lion Becomes the King of Beasts STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] After climbing down from the china wall the travellers found themselves in a disagreeable country , full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall , rank grass STOP It was difficult to walk far without falling into muddy holes , for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight STOP However , by carefully picking their way , they got safely along until they reached solid ground STOP But here the country seemed wilder than ever , and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest , where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen STOP `` This forest is perfectly delightful , '' declared the Lion , looking around him with joy ; `` never have I seen a more beautiful place . STOP `` It seems gloomy , '' said the Scarecrow STOP `` Not a bit of it , '' answered the Lion ; `` I should like to live here all my life STOP See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees STOP Surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home . STOP `` Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now , '' said Dorothy STOP `` I suppose there are , '' returned the Lion ; `` but I do not see any of them about . STOP They walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther STOP Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep , while the Woodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual STOP When morning came they started again STOP Before they had gone far they heard a low rumble , as of the growling of many wild animals STOP Toto whimpered a little but none of the others was frightened and they kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood , in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety STOP There were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history , and for a moment Dorothy was afraid STOP But the Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting , and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble STOP As he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him , and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic STOP The biggest of the tigers came up to the Lion and bowed , saying , [ Illustration ] '' Welcome , O King of Beasts STOP You have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more . STOP `` What is your trouble ? STOP asked the Lion , quietly STOP `` We are all threatened , '' answered the tiger , `` by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest STOP It is a most tremendous monster , like a great spider , with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk STOP It has eight of these long legs , and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth , where he eats it as a spider does a fly STOP Not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive , and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us . STOP The Lion thought for a moment STOP `` Are there any other lions in this forest ? STOP he asked STOP `` No ; there were some , but the monster has eaten them all STOP And , besides , they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you . STOP `` If I put an end to your enemy will you bow down to me and obey me as King of the Forest ? STOP enquired the Lion STOP `` We will do that gladly , '' returned the tiger ; and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar : `` We will ! STOP `` Where is this great spider of yours now ? STOP asked the Lion STOP `` Yonder , among the oak trees , '' said the tiger , pointing with his fore-foot STOP `` Take good care of these friends of mine , '' said the Lion , `` and I will go at once to fight the monster . STOP He bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy STOP The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him , and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust STOP Its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said , and it 's body covered with coarse black hair STOP It had a great mouth , with a row of sharp teeth a foot long ; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp 's waist STOP This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature , and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake , he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster 's back STOP Then , with one blow of his heavy paw , all armed with sharp claws , he knocked the spider 's head from its body STOP Jumping down , he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling , when he knew it was quite dead STOP The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said , proudly , `` You need fear your enemy no longer . STOP Then the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King , and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her way to Kansas STOP STOP The Country of the Quadlings [ Illustration ] [ Illustration : `` _The Head shot forward and struck the Scarecrow._ '' ] [ Illustration ] The four travellers passed through the rest of the forest in safety , and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill , covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock STOP `` That will be a hard climb , '' said the Scarecrow , `` but we must get over the hill , nevertheless . STOP So he led the way and the others followed STOP They had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out , '' Keep back ! STOP `` Who are you ? STOP asked the Scarecrow STOP Then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said , '' This hill belongs to us , and we do n't allow anyone to cross it . STOP `` But we must cross it , '' said the Scarecrow STOP `` We 're going to the country of the Quadlings . STOP `` But you shall not ! STOP replied the voice , and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travellers had ever seen STOP He was quite short and stout and had a big head , which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles STOP But he had no arms at all , and , seeing this , the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill STOP So he said , '' I 'm sorry not to do as you wish , but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not , '' and he walked boldly forward STOP As quick as lightning the man 's head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head , where it was flat , struck the Scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling , over and over , down the hill STOP Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body , and the man laughed harshly as he said , '' It is n't as easy as you think ! STOP A chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks , and Dorothy saw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside , one behind every rock STOP The Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow's mishap , and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder he dashed up the hill STOP Again a head shot swiftly out , and the great Lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball STOP Dorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet , and the Lion came up to her , feeling rather bruised and sore , and said , '' It is useless to fight people with shooting heads ; no one can withstand them . STOP `` What can we do , then ? STOP she asked STOP `` Call the Winged Monkeys , '' suggested the Tin Woodman ; `` you have still the right to command them once more . STOP `` Very well , '' she answered , and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered the magic words STOP The Monkeys were as prompt as ever , and in a few moments the entire band stood before her STOP `` What are your commands ? STOP enquired the King of the Monkeys , bowing low STOP `` Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings , '' answered the girl STOP `` It shall be done , '' said the King , and at once the Winged Monkeys caught the four travellers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with them STOP As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with vexation , and shot their heads high in the air ; but they could not reach the Winged Monkeys , which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the Quadlings STOP `` This is the last time you can summon us , '' said the leader to Dorothy ; `` so good-bye and good luck to you . STOP `` Good-bye , and thank you very much , '' returned the girl ; and the Monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling STOP The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy STOP There was field upon field of ripening grain , with well-paved roads running between , and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them STOP The fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red , just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the country of the Munchkins STOP The Quadlings themselves , who were short and fat and looked chubby and good natured , were dressed all in red , which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain STOP The Monkeys had set them down near a farm house , and the four travellers walked up to it and knocked at the door STOP It was opened by the farmer 's wife , and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner , with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies , and a bowl of milk for Toto STOP `` How far is it to the Castle of Glinda ? STOP asked the child STOP `` It is not a great way , '' answered the farmer 's wife STOP `` Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it . STOP Thanking the good woman , they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful Castle STOP Before the gates were three young girls , dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid ; and as Dorothy approached one of them said to her , '' Why have you come to the South Country ? STOP `` To see the Good Witch who rules here , '' she answered STOP `` Will you take me to her ? STOP `` Let me have your name and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you . STOP They told who they were , and the girl soldier went into the Castle STOP After a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once STOP [ Illustration ] STOP The Good Witch Grants Dorothy's Wish STOP [ Illustration ] [ Illustration : `` _You must give me the Golden Cap._ '' ] [ Illustration ] Before they went to see Glinda , however , they were taken to a room of the Castle , where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair , and the Lion shook the dust out of his mane , and the Scarecrow patted himself into his best shape , and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints STOP When they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies STOP She was both beautiful and young to their eyes STOP Her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders STOP Her dress was pure white ; but her eyes were blue , and they looked kindly upon the little girl STOP `` What can I do for you , my child ? STOP she asked STOP Dorothy told the Witch all her story ; how the cyclone had brought her to the Land of Oz , how she had found her companions , and of the wonderful adventures they had met with STOP `` My greatest wish now , '' she added , `` is to get back to Kansas , for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me , and that will make her put on mourning ; and unless the crops are better this year than they were last I am sure Uncle Henry can not afford it . STOP Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet , upturned face of the loving little girl STOP `` Bless your dear heart , '' she said , `` I am sure I can tell you of a way to get back to Kansas . STOP Then she added : '' But , if I do , you must give me the Golden Cap . STOP `` Willingly ! STOP exclaimed Dorothy ; `` indeed , it is of no use to me now , and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times . STOP `` And I think I shall need their service just those three times , '' answered Glinda , smiling STOP Dorothy then gave her the Golden Cap , and the Witch said to the Scarecrow , '' What will you do when Dorothy has left us ? STOP `` I will return to the Emerald City , '' he replied , `` for Oz has made me its ruler and the people like me STOP The only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads . STOP `` By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry you to the gates of the Emerald City , '' said Glinda , `` for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler . STOP `` Am I really wonderful ? STOP asked the Scarecrow STOP `` You are unusual , '' replied Glinda STOP Turning to the Tin Woodman , she asked : '' What will become of you when Dorothy leaves this country ? STOP He leaned on his axe and thought a moment STOP Then he said , '' The Winkies were very kind to me , and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked Witch died STOP I am fond of the Winkies , and if I could get back again to the country of the West I should like nothing better than to rule over them forever . STOP `` My second command to the Winged Monkeys , '' said Glinda , `` will be that they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies STOP Your brains may not be so large to look at as those of the Scarecrow , but you are really brighter than he is -- when you are well polished -- and I am sure you will rule the Winkies wisely and well . STOP Then the Witch looked at the big , shaggy Lion and asked , '' When Dorothy has returned to her own home , what will become of you ? STOP `` Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads , '' he answered , `` lies a grand old forest , and all the beasts that live there have made me their King STOP If I could only get back to this forest I would pass my life very happily there . STOP `` My third command to the Winged Monkeys , '' said Glinda , `` shall be to carry you to your forest STOP Then , having used up the powers of the Golden Cap , I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys , that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore . STOP The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good Witch earnestly for her kindness , and Dorothy exclaimed , [ Illustration ] '' You are certainly as good as you are beautiful STOP But you have not yet told me how to get back to Kansas .

STOP `` And I should not have had my lovely heart , '' said the Tin Woodman STOP `` I might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world . STOP `` And I should have lived a coward forever , '' declared the Lion , `` and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me . STOP `` This is all true , '' said Dorothy , `` and I am glad I was of use to these good friends STOP But now that each of them has had what he most desired , and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule beside , I think I should like to go back to Kansas . STOP `` The Silver Shoes , '' said the Good Witch , `` have wonderful powers STOP And one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps , and each step will be made in the wink of an eye STOP All you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go . STOP `` If that is so , '' said the child , joyfully , `` I will ask them to carry me back to Kansas at once . STOP She threw her arms around the Lion 's neck and kissed him , patting his big head tenderly STOP Then she kissed the Tin Woodman , who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints STOP But she hugged the soft , stuffed body of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face , and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades STOP Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss , and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself STOP Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms , and having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times , saying , '' Take me home to Aunt Em !

STOP she cried STOP For she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie , and just before her was the new farm-house Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one STOP Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard , and Toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn , barking joyously STOP Dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet STOP For the Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air , and were lost forever in the desert STOP [ Illustration ] STOP Home Again STOP Aunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw Dorothy running toward her STOP `` My darling child ! STOP she cried , folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses ; `` where in the world did you come from ?

SHERLOCK HOLMES STOP IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London , and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army STOP Having completed my studies there , I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon STOP The regiment was stationed in India at the time , and before I could join it , the second Afghan war had broken out STOP On landing at Bombay , I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes , and was already deep in the enemy 's country STOP I followed , however , with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself , and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety , where I found my regiment , and at once entered upon my new duties STOP The campaign brought honours and promotion to many , but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster STOP I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires , with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand STOP There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet , which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery STOP I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray , my orderly , who threw me across a pack-horse , and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines STOP Worn with pain , and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone , I was removed , with a great train of wounded sufferers , to the base hospital at Peshawar STOP Here I rallied , and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards , and even to bask a little upon the verandah , when I was struck down by enteric fever , that curse of our Indian possessions STOP For months my life was despaired of , and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent , I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England STOP I was dispatched , accordingly , in the troopship `` Orontes , '' and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty , with my health irretrievably ruined , but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it STOP I had neither kith nor kin in England , and was therefore as free as air -- or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be STOP Under such circumstances , I naturally gravitated to London , that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained STOP There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand , leading a comfortless , meaningless existence , and spending such money as I had , considerably more freely than I ought STOP So alarming did the state of my finances become , that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country , or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living STOP Choosing the latter alternative , I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel , and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile STOP On the very day that I had come to this conclusion , I was standing at the Criterion Bar , when some one tapped me on the shoulder , and turning round I recognized young Stamford , who had been a dresser under me at Barts STOP The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man STOP In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine , but now I hailed him with enthusiasm , and he , in his turn , appeared to be delighted to see me STOP In the exuberance of my joy , I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn , and we started off together in a hansom STOP `` Whatever have you been doing with yourself , Watson ? STOP he asked in undisguised wonder , as we rattled through the crowded London streets STOP `` You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut . STOP I gave him a short sketch of my adventures , and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination STOP `` Poor devil ! STOP he said , commiseratingly , after he had listened to my misfortunes STOP `` What are you up to now ? STOP `` Looking for lodgings . STOP [ 3 ] I answered STOP `` Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price . STOP `` That 's a strange thing , '' remarked my companion ; `` you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me . STOP `` And who was the first ? STOP I asked STOP `` A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital STOP He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found , and which were too much for his purse . STOP `` By Jove ! STOP I cried , `` if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense , I am the very man for him STOP I should prefer having a partner to being alone . STOP Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass STOP `` You do n't know Sherlock Holmes yet , '' he said ; `` perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion . STOP `` Why , what is there against him ? STOP `` Oh , I did n't say there was anything against him STOP He is a little queer in his ideas -- an enthusiast in some branches of science STOP As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough . STOP `` A medical student , I suppose ? STOP said I STOP `` No -- I have no idea what he intends to go in for STOP I believe he is well up in anatomy , and he is a first-class chemist ; but , as far as I know , he has never taken out any systematic medical classes STOP His studies are very desultory and eccentric , but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors . STOP `` Did you never ask him what he was going in for ? STOP I asked STOP `` No ; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out , though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him . STOP `` I should like to meet him , '' I said STOP `` If I am to lodge with anyone , I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits STOP I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement STOP I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence STOP How could I meet this friend of yours ? STOP `` He is sure to be at the laboratory , '' returned my companion STOP `` He either avoids the place for weeks , or else he works there from morning to night STOP If you like , we shall drive round together after luncheon . STOP `` Certainly , '' I answered , and the conversation drifted away into other channels STOP As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn , Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger STOP `` You must n't blame me if you do n't get on with him , '' he said ; `` I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory STOP You proposed this arrangement , so you must not hold me responsible . STOP `` If we do n't get on it will be easy to part company , '' I answered STOP `` It seems to me , Stamford , '' I added , looking hard at my companion , `` that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter STOP Is this fellow's temper so formidable , or what is it STOP Do n't be mealy-mouthed about it . STOP `` It is not easy to express the inexpressible , '' he answered with a laugh STOP `` Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes -- it approaches to cold-bloodedness STOP I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid , not out of malevolence , you understand , but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects STOP To do him justice , I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness STOP He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge . STOP `` Very right too . STOP `` Yes , but it may be pushed to excess STOP When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick , it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape . STOP `` Beating the subjects ! STOP `` Yes , to verify how far bruises may be produced after death STOP I saw him at it with my own eyes . STOP `` And yet you say he is not a medical student ? STOP `` No STOP Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are STOP But here we are , and you must form your own impressions about him . STOP As he spoke , we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door , which opened into a wing of the great hospital STOP It was familiar ground to me , and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors STOP Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory STOP This was a lofty chamber , lined and littered with countless bottles STOP Broad , low tables were scattered about , which bristled with retorts , test-tubes , and little Bunsen lamps , with their blue flickering flames STOP There was only one student in the room , who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work STOP At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure STOP `` I 've found it STOP I've found it , '' he shouted to my companion , running towards us with a test-tube in his hand STOP `` I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin , [ 4 ] and by nothing else . STOP Had he discovered a gold mine , greater delight could not have shone upon his features STOP `` Dr. Watson , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , '' said Stamford , introducing us STOP `` How are you ? STOP he said cordially , gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit STOP `` You have been in Afghanistan , I perceive . STOP `` How on earth did you know that ? STOP I asked in astonishment STOP `` Never mind , '' said he , chuckling to himself STOP `` The question now is about hoemoglobin STOP No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine ? STOP `` It is interesting , chemically , no doubt , '' I answered , `` but practically -- -- '' '' Why , man , it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years STOP Do n't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains STOP Come over here now ! STOP He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness , and drew me over to the table at which he had been working STOP `` Let us have some fresh blood , '' he said , digging a long bodkin into his finger , and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette STOP `` Now , I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water STOP You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water STOP The proportion of blood can not be more than one in a million STOP I have no doubt , however , that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction . STOP As he spoke , he threw into the vessel a few white crystals , and then added some drops of a transparent fluid STOP In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour , and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar STOP `` Ha STOP ha ! STOP he cried , clapping his hands , and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy STOP `` What do you think of that ? STOP `` It seems to be a very delicate test , '' I remarked STOP `` Beautiful STOP beautiful STOP The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain STOP So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles STOP The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old STOP Now , this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new STOP Had this test been invented , there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes . STOP `` Indeed ! STOP I murmured STOP `` Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point STOP A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed STOP His linen or clothes are examined , and brownish stains discovered upon them STOP Are they blood stains , or mud stains , or rust stains , or fruit stains , or what are they STOP That is a question which has puzzled many an expert , and why STOP Because there was no reliable test STOP Now we have the Sherlock Holmes ' test , and there will no longer be any difficulty . STOP His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke , and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination STOP `` You are to be congratulated , '' I remarked , considerably surprised at his enthusiasm STOP `` There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year STOP He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence STOP Then there was Mason of Bradford , and the notorious Muller , and Lefevre of Montpellier , and Samson of New Orleans STOP I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive . STOP `` You seem to be a walking calendar of crime , '' said Stamford with a laugh STOP `` You might start a paper on those lines STOP Call it the 'Police News of the Past . ' STOP `` Very interesting reading it might be made , too , '' remarked Sherlock Holmes , sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger STOP `` I have to be careful , '' he continued , turning to me with a smile , `` for I dabble with poisons a good deal . STOP He held out his hand as he spoke , and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster , and discoloured with strong acids STOP `` We came here on business , '' said Stamford , sitting down on a high three-legged stool , and pushing another one in my direction with his foot STOP `` My friend here wants to take diggings , and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you , I thought that I had better bring you together . STOP Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me STOP `` I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street , '' he said , `` which would suit us down to the ground STOP You do n't mind the smell of strong tobacco , I hope ? STOP `` I always smoke 'ship 's ' myself , '' I answered STOP `` That 's good enough STOP I generally have chemicals about , and occasionally do experiments STOP Would that annoy you ? STOP `` By no means .

STOP I laughed at this cross-examination STOP `` I keep a bull pup , '' I said , `` and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken , and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours , and I am extremely lazy STOP I have another set of vices when I 'm well , but those are the principal ones at present . STOP `` Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows ? STOP he asked , anxiously STOP `` It depends on the player , '' I answered STOP `` A well-played violin is a treat for the gods -- a badly-played one -- -- '' '' Oh , that 's all right , '' he cried , with a merry laugh STOP `` I think we may consider the thing as settled -- that is , if the rooms are agreeable to you . STOP `` When shall we see them ? STOP `` Call for me here at noon to-morrow , and we 'll go together and settle everything , '' he answered STOP `` All right -- noon exactly , '' said I , shaking his hand STOP We left him working among his chemicals , and we walked together towards my hotel STOP `` By the way , '' I asked suddenly , stopping and turning upon Stamford , `` how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan ? STOP My companion smiled an enigmatical smile STOP `` That 's just his little peculiarity , '' he said STOP `` A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out . STOP `` Oh STOP a mystery is it ? STOP I cried , rubbing my hands STOP `` This is very piquant STOP I am much obliged to you for bringing us together STOP 'The proper study of mankind is man , ' you know . STOP `` You must study him , then , '' Stamford said , as he bade me good-bye STOP `` You 'll find him a knotty problem , though STOP I 'll wager he learns more about you than you about him STOP Good-bye . STOP `` Good-bye , '' I answered , and strolled on to my hotel , considerably interested in my new acquaintance STOP STOP THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION STOP WE met next day as he had arranged , and inspected the rooms at No STOP 221B , [ 5 ] Baker Street , of which he had spoken at our meeting STOP They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room , cheerfully furnished , and illuminated by two broad windows STOP So desirable in every way were the apartments , and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us , that the bargain was concluded upon the spot , and we at once entered into possession STOP That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel , and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus STOP For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage STOP That done , we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings STOP Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with STOP He was quiet in his ways , and his habits were regular STOP It was rare for him to be up after ten at night , and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning STOP Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory , sometimes in the dissecting-rooms , and occasionally in long walks , which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City STOP Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him ; but now and again a reaction would seize him , and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room , hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night STOP On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy , vacant expression in his eyes , that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic , had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion STOP As the weeks went by , my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life , gradually deepened and increased STOP His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer STOP In height he was rather over six feet , and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller STOP His eyes were sharp and piercing , save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded ; and his thin , hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision STOP His chin , too , had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination STOP His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals , yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch , as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments STOP The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody , when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity , and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself STOP Before pronouncing judgment , however , be it remembered , how objectless was my life , and how little there was to engage my attention STOP My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial , and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence STOP Under these circumstances , I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion , and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it STOP He was not studying medicine STOP He had himself , in reply to a question , confirmed Stamford 's opinion upon that point STOP Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world STOP Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable , and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me STOP Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view STOP Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning STOP No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so STOP His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge STOP Of contemporary literature , philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing STOP Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle , he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done STOP My surprise reached a climax , however , when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System STOP That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it STOP `` You appear to be astonished , '' he said , smiling at my expression of surprise STOP `` Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it . STOP `` To forget it ! STOP `` You see , '' he explained , `` I consider that a man 's brain originally is like a little empty attic , and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose STOP A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across , so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out , or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it STOP Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic STOP He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work , but of these he has a large assortment , and all in the most perfect order STOP It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent STOP Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before STOP It is of the highest importance , therefore , not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones . STOP `` But the Solar System ! STOP I protested STOP `` What the deuce is it to me ?

STOP Holmes took a note of the address STOP `` Come along , Doctor , '' he said ; `` we shall go and look him up STOP I 'll tell you one thing which may help you in the case , '' he continued , turning to the two detectives STOP `` There has been murder done , and the murderer was a man STOP He was more than six feet high , was in the prime of life , had small feet for his height , wore coarse , square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar STOP He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab , which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg STOP In all probability the murderer had a florid face , and the finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long STOP These are only a few indications , but they may assist you . STOP Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile STOP `` If this man was murdered , how was it done ? STOP asked the former STOP `` Poison , '' said Sherlock Holmes curtly , and strode off STOP `` One other thing , Lestrade , '' he added , turning round at the door : `` 'Rache , ' is the German for 'revenge ; ' so do n't lose your time looking for Miss Rachel . STOP With which Parthian shot he walked away , leaving the two rivals open-mouthed behind him STOP STOP WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL STOP IT was one o'clock when we left No STOP 3 , Lauriston Gardens STOP Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office , whence he dispatched a long telegram STOP He then hailed a cab , and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade STOP `` There is nothing like first hand evidence , '' he remarked ; `` as a matter of fact , my mind is entirely made up upon the case , but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned . STOP `` You amaze me , Holmes , '' said I STOP `` Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave . STOP `` There 's no room for a mistake , '' he answered STOP `` The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb STOP Now , up to last night , we have had no rain for a week , so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night STOP There were the marks of the horse's hoofs , too , the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three , showing that that was a new shoe STOP Since the cab was there after the rain began , and was not there at any time during the morning -- I have Gregson 's word for that -- it follows that it must have been there during the night , and , therefore , that it brought those two individuals to the house . STOP `` That seems simple enough , '' said I ; `` but how about the other man's height ? STOP `` Why , the height of a man , in nine cases out of ten , can be told from the length of his stride STOP It is a simple calculation enough , though there is no use my boring you with figures STOP I had this fellow 's stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within STOP Then I had a way of checking my calculation STOP When a man writes on a wall , his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes STOP Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground STOP It was child 's play . STOP `` And his age ? STOP I asked STOP `` Well , if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort , he ca n't be quite in the sere and yellow STOP That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across STOP Patent-leather boots had gone round , and Square-toes had hopped over STOP There is no mystery about it at all STOP I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article STOP Is there anything else that puzzles you ? STOP `` The finger nails and the Trichinopoly , '' I suggested STOP `` The writing on the wall was done with a man 's forefinger dipped in blood STOP My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it , which would not have been the case if the man's nail had been trimmed STOP I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor STOP It was dark in colour and flakey -- such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly STOP I have made a special study of cigar ashes -- in fact , I have written a monograph upon the subject STOP I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand , either of cigar or of tobacco STOP It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type . STOP `` And the florid face ? STOP I asked STOP `` Ah , that was a more daring shot , though I have no doubt that I was right STOP You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair . STOP I passed my hand over my brow STOP `` My head is in a whirl , '' I remarked ; `` the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows STOP How came these two men -- if there were two men -- into an empty house STOP What has become of the cabman who drove them STOP How could one man compel another to take poison STOP Where did the blood come from STOP What was the object of the murderer , since robbery had no part in it STOP How came the woman 's ring there STOP Above all , why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping STOP I confess that I can not see any possible way of reconciling all these facts . STOP My companion smiled approvingly STOP `` You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well , '' he said STOP `` There is much that is still obscure , though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts STOP As to poor Lestrade 's discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track , by suggesting Socialism and secret societies STOP It was not done by a German STOP The A , if you noticed , was printed somewhat after the German fashion STOP Now , a real German invariably prints in the Latin character , so that we may safely say that this was not written by one , but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part STOP It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel STOP I 'm not going to tell you much more of the case , Doctor STOP You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick , and if I show you too much of my method of working , you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all . STOP `` I shall never do that , '' I answered ; `` you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world . STOP My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words , and the earnest way in which I uttered them STOP I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty STOP `` I 'll tell you one other thing , '' he said STOP `` Patent leathers [ 10 ] and Square-toes came in the same cab , and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible -- arm-in-arm , in all probability STOP When they got inside they walked up and down the room -- or rather , Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down STOP I could read all that in the dust ; and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited STOP That is shown by the increased length of his strides STOP He was talking all the while , and working himself up , no doubt , into a fury STOP Then the tragedy occurred STOP I 've told you all I know myself now , for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture STOP We have a good working basis , however , on which to start STOP We must hurry up , for I want to go to Halle 's concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon . STOP This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways STOP In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand STOP `` That 's Audley Court in there , '' he said , pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick STOP `` You 'll find me here when you come back . STOP Audley Court was not an attractive locality STOP The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings STOP We picked our way among groups of dirty children , and through lines of discoloured linen , until we came to Number 46 , the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved STOP On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed , and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming STOP He appeared presently , looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers STOP `` I made my report at the office , '' he said STOP Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively STOP `` We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips , '' he said STOP `` I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can , '' the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk STOP `` Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred . STOP Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa , and knitted his brows as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative STOP `` I 'll tell it ye from the beginning , '' he said STOP `` My time is from ten at night to six in the morning STOP At eleven there was a fight at the 'White Hart ' ; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat STOP At one o'clock it began to rain , and I met Harry Murcher -- him who has the Holland Grove beat -- and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin ' STOP Presently -- maybe about two or a little after -- I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road STOP It was precious dirty and lonely STOP Not a soul did I meet all the way down , though a cab or two went past me STOP I was a strollin ' down , thinkin' between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be , when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house STOP Now , I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who wo n't have the drains seen to , though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o ' typhoid fever STOP I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window , and I suspected as something was wrong STOP When I got to the door -- -- '' '' You stopped , and then walked back to the garden gate , '' my companion interrupted STOP `` What did you do that for ? STOP Rance gave a violent jump , and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features STOP `` Why , that 's true , sir , '' he said ; `` though how you come to know it , Heaven only knows STOP Ye see , when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome , that I thought I 'd be none the worse for some one with me STOP I ai n't afeared of anything on this side o ' the grave ; but I thought that maybe it was him that died o ' the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him STOP The thought gave me a kind o ' turn , and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher 's lantern , but there was n't no sign of him nor of anyone else . STOP `` There was no one in the street ? STOP `` Not a livin ' soul , sir , nor as much as a dog STOP Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open STOP All was quiet inside , so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin ' STOP There was a candle flickerin ' on the mantelpiece -- a red wax one -- and by its light I saw -- -- '' '' Yes , I know all that you saw STOP You walked round the room several times , and you knelt down by the body , and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door , and then -- -- '' John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes STOP `` Where was you hid to see all that ? STOP he cried STOP `` It seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should . STOP Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable STOP `` Do n't get arresting me for the murder , '' he said STOP `` I am one of the hounds and not the wolf ; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that STOP Go on , though STOP What did you do next ? STOP Rance resumed his seat , without however losing his mystified expression STOP `` I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle STOP That brought Murcher and two more to the spot . STOP `` Was the street empty then ? STOP `` Well , it was , as far as anybody that could be of any good goes . STOP `` What do you mean ?

STOP `` His face -- his dress -- did n't you notice them ? STOP Holmes broke in impatiently STOP `` I should think I did notice them , seeing that I had to prop him up -- me and Murcher between us STOP He was a long chap , with a red face , the lower part muffled round -- -- '' '' That will do , '' cried Holmes STOP `` What became of him ?

STOP We started off for the cab together , leaving our informant incredulous , but obviously uncomfortable STOP `` The blundering fool , '' Holmes said , bitterly , as we drove back to our lodgings STOP `` Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck , and not taking advantage of it .

STOP He waved his hand , and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats , and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street STOP `` There 's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force , '' Holmes remarked STOP `` The mere sight of an official-looking person seals men 's lips STOP These youngsters , however , go everywhere and hear everything STOP They are as sharp as needles , too ; all they want is organisation . STOP `` Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them ? STOP I asked STOP `` Yes ; there is a point which I wish to ascertain STOP It is merely a matter of time STOP Hullo STOP we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance STOP Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face STOP Bound for us , I know STOP Yes , he is stopping STOP There he is ! STOP There was a violent peal at the bell , and in a few seconds the fair-haired detective came up the stairs , three steps at a time , and burst into our sitting-room STOP `` My dear fellow , '' he cried , wringing Holmes ' unresponsive hand , '' congratulate me STOP I have made the whole thing as clear as day . STOP A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion 's expressive face STOP `` Do you mean that you are on the right track ? STOP he asked STOP `` The right track STOP Why , sir , we have the man under lock and key . STOP `` And his name is ? STOP `` Arthur Charpentier , sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty 's navy , '' cried Gregson , pompously , rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest STOP Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief , and relaxed into a smile STOP `` Take a seat , and try one of these cigars , '' he said STOP `` We are anxious to know how you managed it STOP Will you have some whiskey and water ? STOP `` I do n't mind if I do , '' the detective answered STOP `` The tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out STOP Not so much bodily exertion , you understand , as the strain upon the mind STOP You will appreciate that , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , for we are both brain-workers . STOP `` You do me too much honour , '' said Holmes , gravely STOP `` Let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result . STOP The detective seated himself in the arm-chair , and puffed complacently at his cigar STOP Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement STOP `` The fun of it is , '' he cried , `` that that fool Lestrade , who thinks himself so smart , has gone off upon the wrong track altogether STOP He is after the secretary Stangerson , who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn STOP I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time . STOP The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked STOP `` And how did you get your clue ? STOP `` Ah , I 'll tell you all about it STOP Of course , Doctor Watson , this is strictly between ourselves STOP The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American 's antecedents STOP Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered , or until parties came forward and volunteered information STOP That is not Tobias Gregson's way of going to work STOP You remember the hat beside the dead man ? STOP `` Yes , '' said Holmes ; `` by John Underwood and Sons , 129 , Camberwell Road . STOP Gregson looked quite crest-fallen STOP `` I had no idea that you noticed that , '' he said STOP `` Have you been there ? STOP `` No . STOP `` Ha ! STOP cried Gregson , in a relieved voice ; `` you should never neglect a chance , however small it may seem . STOP `` To a great mind , nothing is little , '' remarked Holmes , sententiously STOP `` Well , I went to Underwood , and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description STOP He looked over his books , and came on it at once STOP He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber , residing at Charpentier 's Boarding Establishment , Torquay Terrace STOP Thus I got at his address . STOP `` Smart -- very smart ! STOP murmured Sherlock Holmes STOP `` I next called upon Madame Charpentier , '' continued the detective STOP `` I found her very pale and distressed STOP Her daughter was in the room , too -- an uncommonly fine girl she is , too ; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her STOP That did n't escape my notice STOP I began to smell a rat STOP You know the feeling , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , when you come upon the right scent -- a kind of thrill in your nerves STOP 'Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber , of Cleveland ? STOP I asked STOP `` The mother nodded STOP She did n't seem able to get out a word STOP The daughter burst into tears STOP I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter STOP `` 'At what o'clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train ? STOP I asked STOP `` 'At eight o'clock , ' she said , gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation STOP 'His secretary , Mr. Stangerson , said that there were two trains -- one at 9.15 and one at 11 STOP He was to catch the first STOP [ 14 ] '' 'And was that the last which you saw of him ? STOP `` A terrible change came over the woman 's face as I asked the question STOP Her features turned perfectly livid STOP It was some seconds before she could get out the single word 'Yes ' -- and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone STOP `` There was silence for a moment , and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice STOP `` 'No good can ever come of falsehood , mother , ' she said STOP 'Let us be frank with this gentleman STOP We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again . STOP `` 'God forgive you ! STOP cried Madame Charpentier , throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair STOP 'You have murdered your brother . STOP `` 'Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth , ' the girl answered firmly STOP `` 'You had best tell me all about it now , ' I said STOP 'Half-confidences are worse than none STOP Besides , you do not know how much we know of it . STOP `` 'On your head be it , Alice ! STOP cried her mother ; and then , turning to me , ' I will tell you all , sir STOP Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair STOP He is utterly innocent of it STOP My dread is , however , that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised STOP That however is surely impossible STOP His high character , his profession , his antecedents would all forbid it . STOP `` 'Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts , ' I answered STOP 'Depend upon it , if your son is innocent he will be none the worse . STOP `` 'Perhaps , Alice , you had better leave us together , ' she said , and her daughter withdrew STOP 'Now , sir , ' she continued , ' I had no intention of telling you all this , but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative STOP Having once decided to speak , I will tell you all without omitting any particular . STOP `` 'It is your wisest course , ' said I STOP `` 'Mr STOP Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks STOP He and his secretary , Mr. Stangerson , had been travelling on the Continent STOP I noticed a '' Copenhagen '' label upon each of their trunks , showing that that had been their last stopping place STOP Stangerson was a quiet reserved man , but his employer , I am sorry to say , was far otherwise STOP He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways STOP The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink , and , indeed , after twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober STOP His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar STOP Worst of all , he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter , Alice , and spoke to her more than once in a way which , fortunately , she is too innocent to understand STOP On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her -- an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct . STOP `` 'But why did you stand all this , ' I asked STOP ' I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish . STOP `` Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question STOP 'Would to God that I had given him notice on the very day that he came , ' she said STOP 'But it was a sore temptation STOP They were paying a pound a day each -- fourteen pounds a week , and this is the slack season STOP I am a widow , and my boy in the Navy has cost me much STOP I grudged to lose the money STOP I acted for the best STOP This last was too much , however , and I gave him notice to leave on account of it STOP That was the reason of his going . STOP `` 'Well ? STOP `` 'My heart grew light when I saw him drive away STOP My son is on leave just now , but I did not tell him anything of all this , for his temper is violent , and he is passionately fond of his sister STOP When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind STOP Alas , in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell , and I learned that Mr. Drebber had returned STOP He was much excited , and evidently the worse for drink STOP He forced his way into the room , where I was sitting with my daughter , and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train STOP He then turned to Alice , and before my very face , proposed to her that she should fly with him STOP `` You are of age , '' he said , `` and there is no law to stop you STOP I have money enough and to spare STOP Never mind the old girl here , but come along with me now straight away STOP You shall live like a princess . STOP Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him , but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door STOP I screamed , and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room STOP What happened then I do not know STOP I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle STOP I was too terrified to raise my head STOP When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing , with a stick in his hand STOP `` I do n't think that fine fellow will trouble us again , '' he said STOP `` I will just go after him and see what he does with himself . STOP With those words he took his hat and started off down the street STOP The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber 's mysterious death . STOP `` This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier 's lips with many gasps and pauses STOP At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words STOP I made shorthand notes of all that she said , however , so that there should be no possibility of a mistake . STOP `` It 's quite exciting , '' said Sherlock Holmes , with a yawn STOP `` What happened next ? STOP `` When Mrs. Charpentier paused , '' the detective continued , `` I saw that the whole case hung upon one point STOP Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women , I asked her at what hour her son returned STOP `` ' I do not know , ' she answered STOP `` 'Not know ? STOP `` 'No ; he has a latch-key , and he let himself in . STOP `` 'After you went to bed ? STOP `` 'Yes . STOP `` 'When did you go to bed ? STOP `` 'About eleven . STOP `` 'So your son was gone at least two hours ? STOP `` 'Yes . STOP `` 'Possibly four or five ? STOP `` 'Yes . STOP `` 'What was he doing during that time ? STOP `` ' I do not know , ' she answered , turning white to her very lips STOP `` Of course after that there was nothing more to be done STOP I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was , took two officers with me , and arrested him STOP When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us , he answered us as bold as brass , ' I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber , ' he said STOP We had said nothing to him about it , so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect . STOP `` Very , '' said Holmes STOP `` He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed Drebber STOP It was a stout oak cudgel . STOP `` What is your theory , then ? STOP `` Well , my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road STOP When there , a fresh altercation arose between them , in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick , in the pit of the stomach , perhaps , which killed him without leaving any mark STOP The night was so wet that no one was about , so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house STOP As to the candle , and the blood , and the writing on the wall , and the ring , they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent . STOP `` Well done ! STOP said Holmes in an encouraging voice STOP `` Really , Gregson , you are getting along STOP We shall make something of you yet . STOP `` I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly , '' the detective answered proudly STOP `` The young man volunteered a statement , in which he said that after following Drebber some time , the latter perceived him , and took a cab in order to get away from him STOP On his way home he met an old shipmate , and took a long walk with him STOP On being asked where this old shipmate lived , he was unable to give any satisfactory reply STOP I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well STOP What amuses me is to think of Lestrade , who had started off upon the wrong scent STOP I am afraid he wo n't make much of [ 15 ] Why , by Jove , here 's the very man himself ! STOP It was indeed Lestrade , who had ascended the stairs while we were talking , and who now entered the room STOP The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were , however , wanting STOP His face was disturbed and troubled , while his clothes were disarranged and untidy STOP He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes , for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out STOP He stood in the centre of the room , fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do STOP `` This is a most extraordinary case , '' he said at last -- '' a most incomprehensible affair . STOP `` Ah , you find it so , Mr STOP Lestrade ! STOP cried Gregson , triumphantly STOP `` I thought you would come to that conclusion STOP Have you managed to find the Secretary , Mr. Joseph Stangerson ? STOP `` The Secretary , Mr. Joseph Stangerson , '' said Lestrade gravely , `` was murdered at Halliday 's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning . STOP STOP LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS STOP THE intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected , that we were all three fairly dumfoundered STOP Gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water STOP I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes , whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes STOP `` Stangerson too ! STOP he muttered STOP `` The plot thickens . STOP `` It was quite thick enough before , '' grumbled Lestrade , taking a chair STOP `` I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war . STOP `` Are you -- are you sure of this piece of intelligence ? STOP stammered Gregson STOP `` I have just come from his room , '' said Lestrade STOP `` I was the first to discover what had occurred . STOP `` We have been hearing Gregson 's view of the matter , '' Holmes observed STOP `` Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done ? STOP `` I have no objection , '' Lestrade answered , seating himself STOP `` I freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber STOP This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken STOP Full of the one idea , I set myself to find out what had become of the Secretary STOP They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third STOP At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road STOP The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime , and what had become of him afterwards STOP I telegraphed to Liverpool , giving a description of the man , and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats STOP I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston STOP You see , I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated , the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night , and then to hang about the station again next morning . STOP `` They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand , '' remarked Holmes STOP `` So it proved STOP I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail STOP This morning I began very early , and at eight o'clock I reached Halliday 's Private Hotel , in Little George Street STOP On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there , they at once answered me in the affirmative STOP `` 'No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting , ' they said STOP 'He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days . STOP `` 'Where is he now ? STOP I asked STOP `` 'He is upstairs in bed STOP He wished to be called at nine . STOP `` ' I will go up and see him at once , ' I said STOP `` It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded STOP The Boots volunteered to show me the room : it was on the second floor , and there was a small corridor leading up to it STOP The Boots pointed out the door to me , and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish , in spite of my twenty years ' experience STOP From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood , which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side STOP I gave a cry , which brought the Boots back STOP He nearly fainted when he saw it STOP The door was locked on the inside , but we put our shoulders to it , and knocked it in STOP The window of the room was open , and beside the window , all huddled up , lay the body of a man in his nightdress STOP He was quite dead , and had been for some time , for his limbs were rigid and cold STOP When we turned him over , the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson STOP The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side , which must have penetrated the heart STOP And now comes the strangest part of the affair STOP What do you suppose was above the murdered man ? STOP I felt a creeping of the flesh , and a presentiment of coming horror , even before Sherlock Holmes answered STOP `` The word RACHE , written in letters of blood , '' he said STOP `` That was it , '' said Lestrade , in an awe-struck voice ; and we were all silent for a while STOP There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin , that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes STOP My nerves , which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought of it STOP `` The man was seen , '' continued Lestrade STOP `` A milk boy , passing on his way to the dairy , happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel STOP He noticed that a ladder , which usually lay there , was raised against one of the windows of the second floor , which was wide open STOP After passing , he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder STOP He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel STOP He took no particular notice of him , beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work STOP He has an impression that the man was tall , had a reddish face , and was dressed in a long , brownish coat STOP He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder , for we found blood-stained water in the basin , where he had washed his hands , and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife . STOP I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer , which tallied so exactly with his own STOP There was , however , no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face STOP `` Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer ? STOP he asked STOP `` Nothing STOP Stangerson had Drebber 's purse in his pocket , but it seems that this was usual , as he did all the paying STOP There was eighty odd pounds in it , but nothing had been taken STOP Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes , robbery is certainly not one of them STOP There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man 's pocket , except a single telegram , dated from Cleveland about a month ago , and containing the words , ' J STOP H. is in Europe . STOP There was no name appended to this message . STOP `` And there was nothing else ? STOP Holmes asked STOP `` Nothing of any importance STOP The man 's novel , with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed , and his pipe was on a chair beside him STOP There was a glass of water on the table , and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills . STOP Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight STOP `` The last link , '' he cried , exultantly STOP `` My case is complete . STOP The two detectives stared at him in amazement STOP `` I have now in my hands , '' my companion said , confidently , `` all the threads which have formed such a tangle STOP There are , of course , details to be filled in , but I am as certain of all the main facts , from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station , up to the discovery of the body of the latter , as if I had seen them with my own eyes STOP I will give you a proof of my knowledge STOP Could you lay your hand upon those pills ? STOP `` I have them , '' said Lestrade , producing a small white box ; `` I took them and the purse and the telegram , intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station STOP It was the merest chance my taking these pills , for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to them . STOP `` Give them here , '' said Holmes STOP `` Now , Doctor , '' turning to me , `` are those ordinary pills ? STOP They certainly were not STOP They were of a pearly grey colour , small , round , and almost transparent against the light STOP `` From their lightness and transparency , I should imagine that they are soluble in water , '' I remarked STOP `` Precisely so , '' answered Holmes STOP `` Now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long , and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday . STOP I went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms STOP It 's laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end STOP Indeed , its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence STOP I placed it upon a cushion on the rug STOP `` I will now cut one of these pills in two , '' said Holmes , and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word STOP `` One half we return into the box for future purposes STOP The other half I will place in this wine glass , in which is a teaspoonful of water STOP You perceive that our friend , the Doctor , is right , and that it readily dissolves . STOP `` This may be very interesting , '' said Lestrade , in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at , `` I can not see , however , what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson . STOP `` Patience , my friend , patience STOP You will find in time that it has everything to do with it STOP I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable , and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough . STOP As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier , who speedily licked it dry STOP Sherlock Holmes ' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence , watching the animal intently , and expecting some startling effect STOP None such appeared , however STOP The dog continued to lie stretched upon tho [ 16 ] cushion , breathing in a laboured way , but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught STOP Holmes had taken out his watch , and as minute followed minute without result , an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features STOP He gnawed his lip , drummed his fingers upon the table , and showed every other symptom of acute impatience STOP So great was his emotion , that I felt sincerely sorry for him , while the two detectives smiled derisively , by no means displeased at this check which he had met STOP `` It ca n't be a coincidence , '' he cried , at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room ; `` it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence STOP The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson STOP And yet they are inert STOP What can it mean STOP Surely my whole chain of reasoning can not have been false STOP It is impossible STOP And yet this wretched dog is none the worse STOP Ah , I have it STOP I have it ! STOP With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box , cut the other pill in two , dissolved it , added milk , and presented it to the terrier STOP The unfortunate creature 's tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb , and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning STOP Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath , and wiped the perspiration from his forehead STOP `` I should have more faith , '' he said ; `` I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions , it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation STOP Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison , and the other was entirely harmless STOP I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all . STOP This last statement appeared to me to be so startling , that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses STOP There was the dead dog , however , to prove that his conjecture had been correct STOP It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away , and I began to have a dim , vague perception of the truth STOP `` All this seems strange to you , '' continued Holmes , `` because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you STOP I had the good fortune to seize upon that , and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition , and , indeed , was the logical sequence of it STOP Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure , have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions STOP It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery STOP The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn STOP This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _outre_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable STOP These strange details , far from making the case more difficult , have really had the effect of making it less so . STOP Mr. Gregson , who had listened to this address with considerable impatience , could contain himself no longer STOP `` Look here , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , '' he said , `` we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man , and that you have your own methods of working STOP We want something more than mere theory and preaching now , though STOP It is a case of taking the man STOP I have made my case out , and it seems I was wrong STOP Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair STOP Lestrade went after his man , Stangerson , and it appears that he was wrong too STOP You have thrown out hints here , and hints there , and seem to know more than we do , but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business STOP Can you name the man who did it ? STOP `` I can not help feeling that Gregson is right , sir , '' remarked Lestrade STOP `` We have both tried , and we have both failed STOP You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require STOP Surely you will not withhold it any longer . STOP `` Any delay in arresting the assassin , '' I observed , `` might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity . STOP Thus pressed by us all , Holmes showed signs of irresolution STOP He continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down , as was his habit when lost in thought STOP `` There will be no more murders , '' he said at last , stopping abruptly and facing us STOP `` You can put that consideration out of the question STOP You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin STOP I do STOP The mere knowing of his name is a small thing , however , compared with the power of laying our hands upon him STOP This I expect very shortly to do STOP I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements ; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling , for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with , who is supported , as I have had occasion to prove , by another who is as clever as himself STOP As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him ; but if he had the slightest suspicion , he would change his name , and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city STOP Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings , I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force , and that is why I have not asked your assistance STOP If I fail I shall , of course , incur all the blame due to this omission ; but that I am prepared for STOP At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations , I shall do so . STOP Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance , or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police STOP The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair , while the other 's beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment STOP Neither of them had time to speak , however , before there was a tap at the door , and the spokesman of the street Arabs , young Wiggins , introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person STOP `` Please , sir , '' he said , touching his forelock , `` I have the cab downstairs . STOP `` Good boy , '' said Holmes , blandly STOP `` Why do n't you introduce this pattern at Scotland Yard ? STOP he continued , taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer STOP `` See how beautifully the spring works STOP They fasten in an instant . STOP `` The old pattern is good enough , '' remarked Lestrade , `` if we can only find the man to put them on . STOP `` Very good , very good , '' said Holmes , smiling STOP `` The cabman may as well help me with my boxes STOP Just ask him to step up , Wiggins . STOP I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey , since he had not said anything to me about it STOP There was a small portmanteau in the room , and this he pulled out and began to strap STOP He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room STOP `` Just give me a help with this buckle , cabman , '' he said , kneeling over his task , and never turning his head STOP The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen , defiant air , and put down his hands to assist STOP At that instant there was a sharp click , the jangling of metal , and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again STOP `` Gentlemen , '' he cried , with flashing eyes , `` let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope , the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson . STOP The whole thing occurred in a moment -- so quickly that I had no time to realize it STOP I have a vivid recollection of that instant , of Holmes' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice , of the cabman's dazed , savage face , as he glared at the glittering handcuffs , which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists STOP For a second or two we might have been a group of statues STOP Then , with an inarticulate roar of fury , the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes 's grasp , and hurled himself through the window STOP Woodwork and glass gave way before him ; but before he got quite through , Gregson , Lestrade , and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds STOP He was dragged back into the room , and then commenced a terrific conflict STOP So powerful and so fierce was he , that the four of us were shaken off again and again STOP He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit STOP His face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass , but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance STOP It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail ; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands STOP That done , we rose to our feet breathless and panting STOP `` We have his cab , '' said Sherlock Holmes STOP `` It will serve to take him to Scotland Yard STOP And now , gentlemen , '' he continued , with a pleasant smile , '' we have reached the end of our little mystery STOP You are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now , and there is no danger that I will refuse to answer them .

nothing but silence -- complete and heart-subduing silence STOP It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain STOP That is hardly true STOP Looking down from the Sierra Blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance STOP It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers STOP Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali STOP Approach , and examine them STOP They are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate STOP The former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men STOP For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside STOP Looking down on this very scene , there stood upon the fourth of May , eighteen hundred and forty-seven , a solitary traveller STOP His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region STOP An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty STOP His face was lean and haggard , and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones ; his long , brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white ; his eyes were sunken in his head , and burned with an unnatural lustre ; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton STOP As he stood , he leaned upon his weapon for support , and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution STOP His gaunt face , however , and his clothes , which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs , proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance STOP The man was dying -- dying from hunger and from thirst STOP He had toiled painfully down the ravine , and on to this little elevation , in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water STOP Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes , and the distant belt of savage mountains , without a sign anywhere of plant or tree , which might indicate the presence of moisture STOP In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope STOP North , and east , and west he looked with wild questioning eyes , and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end , and that there , on that barren crag , he was about to die STOP `` Why not here , as well as in a feather bed , twenty years hence , '' he muttered , as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder STOP Before sitting down , he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle , and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl , which he had carried slung over his right shoulder STOP It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength , for in lowering it , it came down on the ground with some little violence STOP Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry , and from it there protruded a small , scared face , with very bright brown eyes , and two little speckled , dimpled fists STOP `` You 've hurt me ! STOP said a childish voice reproachfully STOP `` Have I though , '' the man answered penitently , `` I did n't go for to do it . STOP As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age , whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother 's care STOP The child was pale and wan , but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion STOP `` How is it now ? STOP he answered anxiously , for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head STOP `` Kiss it and make it well , '' she said , with perfect gravity , shoving [ 19 ] the injured part up to him STOP `` That 's what mother used to do STOP Where's mother ? STOP `` Mother 's gone STOP I guess you 'll see her before long . STOP `` Gone , eh ! STOP said the little girl STOP `` Funny , she did n't say good-bye ; she 'most always did if she was just goin ' over to Auntie 's for tea , and now she 's been away three days STOP Say , it 's awful dry , ai n't it STOP Ai n't there no water , nor nothing to eat ? STOP `` No , there ai n't nothing , dearie STOP You 'll just need to be patient awhile , and then you 'll be all right STOP Put your head up agin me like that , and then you 'll feel bullier STOP It ai n't easy to talk when your lips is like leather , but I guess I 'd best let you know how the cards lie STOP What's that you 've got ? STOP `` Pretty things STOP fine things ! STOP cried the little girl enthusiastically , holding up two glittering fragments of mica STOP `` When we goes back to home I 'll give them to brother Bob . STOP `` You 'll see prettier things than them soon , '' said the man confidently STOP `` You just wait a bit STOP I was going to tell you though -- you remember when we left the river ? STOP `` Oh , yes . STOP `` Well , we reckoned we 'd strike another river soon , d 'ye see STOP But there was somethin ' wrong ; compasses , or map , or somethin ' , and it didn't turn up STOP Water ran out STOP Just except a little drop for the likes of you and -- and -- -- '' '' And you could n't wash yourself , '' interrupted his companion gravely , staring up at his grimy visage STOP `` No , nor drink STOP And Mr. Bender , he was the fust to go , and then Indian Pete , and then Mrs. McGregor , and then Johnny Hones , and then , dearie , your mother . STOP `` Then mother 's a deader too , '' cried the little girl dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly STOP `` Yes , they all went except you and me STOP Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction , so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together STOP It do n't seem as though we 've improved matters STOP There 's an almighty small chance for us now ! STOP `` Do you mean that we are going to die too ? STOP asked the child , checking her sobs , and raising her tear-stained face STOP `` I guess that 's about the size of it . STOP `` Why did n't you say so before ? STOP she said , laughing gleefully STOP `` You gave me such a fright STOP Why , of course , now as long as we die we 'll be with mother again . STOP `` Yes , you will , dearie . STOP `` And you too STOP I 'll tell her how awful good you 've been STOP I 'll bet she meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water , and a lot of buckwheat cakes , hot , and toasted on both sides , like Bob and me was fond of STOP How long will it be first ? STOP `` I do n't know -- not very long . STOP The man 's eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon STOP In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment , so rapidly did they approach STOP They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds , which circled over the heads of the two wanderers , and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them STOP They were buzzards , the vultures of the west , whose coming is the forerunner of death STOP `` Cocks and hens , '' cried the little girl gleefully , pointing at their ill-omened forms , and clapping her hands to make them rise STOP `` Say , did God make this country ? STOP `` In course He did , '' said her companion , rather startled by this unexpected question STOP `` He made the country down in Illinois , and He made the Missouri , '' the little girl continued STOP `` I guess somebody else made the country in these parts STOP It 's not nearly so well done STOP They forgot the water and the trees . STOP `` What would ye think of offering up prayer ? STOP the man asked diffidently STOP `` It ai n't night yet , '' she answered STOP `` It do n't matter STOP It ai n't quite regular , but He wo n't mind that , you bet STOP You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the Plains . STOP `` Why do n't you say some yourself ? STOP the child asked , with wondering eyes STOP `` I disremember them , '' he answered STOP `` I hai n't said none since I was half the height o ' that gun STOP I guess it 's never too late STOP You say them out , and I 'll stand by and come in on the choruses . STOP `` Then you 'll need to kneel down , and me too , '' she said , laying the shawl out for that purpose STOP `` You 've got to put your hands up like this STOP It makes you feel kind o ' good . STOP It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it STOP Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers , the little prattling child and the reckless , hardened adventurer STOP Her chubby face , and his haggard , angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face , while the two voices -- the one thin and clear , the other deep and harsh -- united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness STOP The prayer finished , they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep , nestling upon the broad breast of her protector STOP He watched over her slumber for some time , but Nature proved to be too strong for him STOP For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose STOP Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes , and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast , until the man 's grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion , and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber STOP Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes STOP Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust , very slight at first , and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance , but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid , well-defined cloud STOP This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures STOP In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him STOP This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds STOP As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing , the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze , and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West STOP But what a caravan STOP When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains , the rear was not yet visible on the horizon STOP Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array , waggons and carts , men on horseback , and men on foot STOP Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens , and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings STOP This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants , but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country STOP There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity , with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses STOP Loud as it was , it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them STOP At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men , clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles STOP On reaching the base of the bluff they halted , and held a short council among themselves STOP `` The wells are to the right , my brothers , '' said one , a hard-lipped , clean-shaven man with grizzly hair STOP `` To the right of the Sierra Blanco -- so we shall reach the Rio Grande , '' said another STOP `` Fear not for water , '' cried a third STOP `` He who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people . STOP `` Amen STOP Amen ! STOP responded the whole party STOP They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them STOP From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink , showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind STOP At the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns , while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard STOP The word 'Redskins ' was on every lip STOP `` There ca n't be any number of Injuns here , '' said the elderly man who appeared to be in command STOP `` We have passed the Pawnees , and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains . STOP `` Shall I go forward and see , Brother Stangerson , '' asked one of the band STOP `` And I , '' `` and I , '' cried a dozen voices STOP `` Leave your horses below and we will await you here , '' the Elder answered STOP In a moment the young fellows had dismounted , fastened their horses , and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity STOP They advanced rapidly and noiselessly , with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts STOP The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline STOP The young man who had first given the alarm was leading them STOP Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands , as though overcome with astonishment , and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes STOP On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder , and against this boulder there lay a tall man , long-bearded and hard-featured , but of an excessive thinness STOP His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep STOP Beside him lay a little child , with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck , and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic STOP Her rosy lips were parted , showing the regular line of snow-white teeth within , and a playful smile played over her infantile features STOP Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles , offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion STOP On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards , who , at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away STOP The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about [ 20 ] them in bewilderment STOP The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him , and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts STOP His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed , and he passed his boney hand over his eyes STOP `` This is what they call delirium , I guess , '' he muttered STOP The child stood beside him , holding on to the skirt of his coat , and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood STOP The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion STOP One of them seized the little girl , and hoisted her upon his shoulder , while two others supported her gaunt companion , and assisted him towards the waggons STOP `` My name is John Ferrier , '' the wanderer explained ; `` me and that little un are all that 's left o ' twenty-one people STOP The rest is all dead o' thirst and hunger away down in the south . STOP `` Is she your child ? STOP asked someone STOP `` I guess she is now , '' the other cried , defiantly ; `` she 's mine 'cause I saved her STOP No man will take her from me STOP She 's Lucy Ferrier from this day on STOP Who are you , though ? STOP he continued , glancing with curiosity at his stalwart , sunburned rescuers ; `` there seems to be a powerful lot of ye . STOP `` Nigh upon ten thousand , '' said one of the young men ; `` we are the persecuted children of God -- the chosen of the Angel Merona . STOP `` I never heard tell on him , '' said the wanderer STOP `` He appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye . STOP `` Do not jest at that which is sacred , '' said the other sternly STOP `` We are of those who believe in those sacred writings , drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold , which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at Palmyra STOP We have come from Nauvoo , in the State of Illinois , where we had founded our temple STOP We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless , even though it be the heart of the desert . STOP The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier STOP `` I see , '' he said , `` you are the Mormons . STOP `` We are the Mormons , '' answered his companions with one voice STOP `` And where are you going ? STOP `` We do not know STOP The hand of God is leading us under the person of our Prophet STOP You must come before him STOP He shall say what is to be done with you . STOP They had reached the base of the hill by this time , and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims -- pale-faced meek-looking women , strong laughing children , and anxious earnest-eyed men STOP Many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other STOP Their escort did not halt , however , but pushed on , followed by a great crowd of Mormons , until they reached a waggon , which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance STOP Six horses were yoked to it , whereas the others were furnished with two , or , at most , four a-piece STOP Beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age , but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader STOP He was reading a brown-backed volume , but as the crowd approached he laid it aside , and listened attentively to an account of the episode STOP Then he turned to the two castaways STOP `` If we take you with us , '' he said , in solemn words , `` it can only be as believers in our own creed STOP We shall have no wolves in our fold STOP Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit STOP Will you come with us on these terms ? STOP `` Guess I 'll come with you on any terms , '' said Ferrier , with such emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile STOP The leader alone retained his stern , impressive expression STOP `` Take him , Brother Stangerson , '' he said , `` give him food and drink , and the child likewise STOP Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed STOP We have delayed long enough STOP Forward STOP On , on to Zion ! STOP `` On , on to Zion ! STOP cried the crowd of Mormons , and the words rippled down the long caravan , passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance STOP With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion , and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more STOP The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed , led them to his waggon , where a meal was already awaiting them STOP `` You shall remain here , '' he said STOP `` In a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues STOP In the meantime , remember that now and for ever you are of our religion STOP Brigham Young has said it , and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith , which is the voice of God . STOP STOP THE FLOWER OF UTAH STOP THIS is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven STOP From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history STOP The savage man , and the savage beast , hunger , thirst , fatigue , and disease -- every impediment which Nature could place in the way , had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity STOP Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them STOP There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them , and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land , and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore STOP Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief STOP Maps were drawn and charts prepared , in which the future city was sketched out STOP All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual STOP The tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling STOP In the town streets and squares sprang up , as if by magic STOP In the country there was draining and hedging , planting and clearing , until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop STOP Everything prospered in the strange settlement STOP Above all , the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger STOP From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight , the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers STOP The two castaways , John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter , accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage STOP Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson 's waggon , a retreat which she shared with the Mormon 's three wives and with his son , a headstrong forward boy of twelve STOP Having rallied , with the elasticity of childhood , from the shock caused by her mother 's death , she soon became a pet with the women , and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered home STOP In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations , distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter STOP So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions , that when they reached the end of their wanderings , it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers , with the exception of Young himself , and of Stangerson , Kemball , Johnston , and Drebber , who were the four principal Elders STOP On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house , which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa STOP He was a man of a practical turn of mind , keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands STOP His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands STOP Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly STOP In three years he was better off than his neighbours , in six he was well-to-do , in nine he was rich , and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him STOP From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier STOP There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his co-religionists STOP No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions STOP He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal , but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination STOP There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion , and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense STOP Others , again , spoke of some early love affair , and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic STOP Whatever the reason , Ferrier remained strictly celibate STOP In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement , and gained the name of being an orthodox and straight-walking man STOP Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house , and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings STOP The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl STOP As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger , her cheek more rudy , and her step more elastic STOP Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier 's farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields , or met her mounted upon her father 's mustang , and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West STOP So the bud blossomed into a flower , and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope STOP It was not the father , however , who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman STOP It seldom is in such cases STOP That mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates STOP Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her , and she learns , with a mixture of pride and of fear , that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her STOP There are few who can not recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life STOP In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself , apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides STOP It was a warm June morning , and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem STOP In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry STOP Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules , all heading to the west , for the gold fever had broken out in California , and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect STOP There , too , were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands , and trains of tired immigrants , men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey STOP Through all this motley assemblage , threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider , there galloped Lucy Ferrier , her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her STOP She had a commission from her father in the City , and was dashing in as she had done many a time before , with all the fearlessness of youth , thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed STOP The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment , and even the unemotional Indians , journeying in with their pelties , relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden STOP She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle , driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains STOP In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap STOP Scarcely had she got fairly into it , however , before the beasts closed in behind her , and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed , long-horned bullocks STOP Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle , she was not alarmed at her situation , but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade STOP Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures , either by accident or design , came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang , and excited it to madness STOP In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage , and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider STOP The situation was full of peril STOP Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again , and goaded it to fresh madness STOP It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle , yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals STOP Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies , her head began to swim , and her grip upon the bridle to relax STOP Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures , she might have abandoned her efforts in despair , but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance STOP At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb , and forcing a way through the drove , soon brought her to the outskirts STOP `` You 're not hurt , I hope , miss , '' said her preserver , respectfully STOP She looked up at his dark , fierce face , and laughed saucily STOP `` I 'm awful frightened , '' she said , naively ; `` whoever would have thought that Poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows ? STOP `` Thank God you kept your seat , '' the other said earnestly STOP He was a tall , savage-looking young fellow , mounted on a powerful roan horse , and clad in the rough dress of a hunter , with a long rifle slung over his shoulders STOP `` I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier , '' he remarked , '' I saw you ride down from his house STOP When you see him , ask him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis STOP If he 's the same Ferrier , my father and he were pretty thick . STOP `` Had n't you better come and ask yourself ? STOP she asked , demurely STOP The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion , and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure STOP `` I 'll do so , '' he said , `` we 've been in the mountains for two months , and are not over and above in visiting condition STOP He must take us as he finds us . STOP `` He has a good deal to thank you for , and so have I , '' she answered , '' he 's awful fond of me STOP If those cows had jumped on me he 'd have never got over it . STOP `` Neither would I , '' said her companion STOP `` You STOP Well , I do n't see that it would make much matter to you , anyhow STOP You ai n't even a friend of ours . STOP The young hunter 's dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud STOP `` There , I did n't mean that , '' she said ; `` of course , you are a friend now STOP You must come and see us STOP Now I must push along , or father wo n't trust me with his business any more STOP Good-bye ! STOP `` Good-bye , '' he answered , raising his broad sombrero , and bending over her little hand STOP She wheeled her mustang round , gave it a cut with her riding-whip , and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust STOP Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions , gloomy and taciturn STOP He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver , and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered STOP He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel STOP The sight of the fair young girl , as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes , had stirred his volcanic , untamed heart to its very depths STOP When she had vanished from his sight , he realized that a crisis had come in his life , and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one STOP The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden , changeable fancy of a boy , but rather the wild , fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper STOP He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook STOP He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful STOP He called on John Ferrier that night , and many times again , until his face was a familiar one at the farm-house STOP John , cooped up in the valley , and absorbed in his work , had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years STOP All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him , and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father STOP He had been a pioneer in California , and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild , halcyon days STOP He had been a scout too , and a trapper , a silver explorer , and a ranchman STOP Wherever stirring adventures were to be had , Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them STOP He soon became a favourite with the old farmer , who spoke eloquently of his virtues STOP On such occasions , Lucy was silent , but her blushing cheek and her bright , happy eyes , showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own STOP Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms , but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections STOP It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate STOP She was at the doorway , and came down to meet him STOP He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway STOP `` I am off , Lucy , '' he said , taking her two hands in his , and gazing tenderly down into her face ; `` I wo n't ask you to come with me now , but will you be ready to come when I am here again ? STOP `` And when will that be ? STOP she asked , blushing and laughing STOP `` A couple of months at the outside STOP I will come and claim you then , my darling STOP There 's no one who can stand between us . STOP `` And how about father ? STOP she asked STOP `` He has given his consent , provided we get these mines working all right STOP I have no fear on that head . STOP `` Oh , well ; of course , if you and father have arranged it all , there's no more to be said , '' she whispered , with her cheek against his broad breast STOP `` Thank God ! STOP he said , hoarsely , stooping and kissing her STOP `` It is settled , then STOP The longer I stay , the harder it will be to go STOP They are waiting for me at the canon STOP Good-bye , my own darling -- good-bye STOP In two months you shall see me . STOP He tore himself from her as he spoke , and , flinging himself upon his horse , galloped furiously away , never even looking round , as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving STOP She stood at the gate , gazing after him until he vanished from her sight STOP Then she walked back into the house , the happiest girl in all Utah STOP STOP JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET STOP THREE weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had departed from Salt Lake City STOP John Ferrier 's heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man 's return , and of the impending loss of his adopted child STOP Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done STOP He had always determined , deep down in his resolute heart , that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon STOP Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all , but as a shame and a disgrace STOP Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines , upon that one point he was inflexible STOP He had to seal his mouth on the subject , however , for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints STOP Yes , a dangerous matter -- so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath , lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued , and bring down a swift retribution upon them STOP The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account , and persecutors of the most terrible description STOP Not the Inquisition of Seville , nor the German Vehm-gericht , nor the Secret Societies of Italy , were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of Utah STOP Its invisibility , and the mystery which was attached to it , made this organization doubly terrible STOP It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent , and yet was neither seen nor heard STOP The man who held out against the Church vanished away , and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him STOP His wife and his children awaited him at home , but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges STOP A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation , and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them STOP No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling , and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them STOP At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who , having embraced the Mormon faith , wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it STOP Soon , however , it took a wider range STOP The supply of adult women was running short , and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed STOP Strange rumours began to be bandied about -- rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen STOP Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders -- women who pined and wept , and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror STOP Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men , masked , stealthy , and noiseless , who flitted by them in the darkness STOP These tales and rumours took substance and shape , and were corroborated and re-corroborated , until they resolved themselves into a definite name STOP To this day , in the lonely ranches of the West , the name of the Danite Band , or the Avenging Angels , is a sinister and an ill-omened one STOP Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men STOP None knew who belonged to this ruthless society STOP The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret STOP The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission , might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation STOP Hence every man feared his neighbour , and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart STOP One fine morning , John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields , when he heard the click of the latch , and , looking through the window , saw a stout , sandy-haired , middle-aged man coming up the pathway STOP His heart leapt to his mouth , for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself STOP Full of trepidation -- for he knew that such a visit boded him little good -- Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief STOP The latter , however , received his salutations coldly , and followed him with a stern face into the sitting-room STOP `` Brother Ferrier , '' he said , taking a seat , and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his light-coloured eyelashes , `` the true believers have been good friends to you STOP We picked you up when you were starving in the desert , we shared our food with you , led you safe to the Chosen Valley , gave you a goodly share of land , and allowed you to wax rich under our protection STOP Is not this so ? STOP `` It is so , '' answered John Ferrier STOP `` In return for all this we asked but one condition : that was , that you should embrace the true faith , and conform in every way to its usages STOP This you promised to do , and this , if common report says truly , you have neglected . STOP `` And how have I neglected it ? STOP asked Ferrier , throwing out his hands in expostulation STOP `` Have I not given to the common fund STOP Have I not attended at the Temple STOP Have I not -- -- ? STOP `` Where are your wives ? STOP asked Young , looking round him STOP `` Call them in , that I may greet them . STOP `` It is true that I have not married , '' Ferrier answered STOP `` But women were few , and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man : I had my daughter to attend to my wants . STOP `` It is of that daughter that I would speak to you , '' said the leader of the Mormons STOP `` She has grown to be the flower of Utah , and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land . STOP John Ferrier groaned internally STOP `` There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve -- stories that she is sealed to some Gentile STOP This must be the gossip of idle tongues STOP What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith STOP 'Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect ; for if she wed a Gentile , she commits a grievous sin . STOP This being so , it is impossible that you , who profess the holy creed , should suffer your daughter to violate it . STOP John Ferrier made no answer , but he played nervously with his riding-whip STOP `` Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested -- so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four STOP The girl is young , and we would not have her wed grey hairs , neither would we deprive her of all choice STOP We Elders have many heifers , [ 29 ] but our children must also be provided STOP Stangerson has a son , and Drebber has a son , and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house STOP Let her choose between them STOP They are young and rich , and of the true faith STOP What say you to that ? STOP Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted STOP `` You will give us time , '' he said at last STOP `` My daughter is very young -- she is scarce of an age to marry . STOP `` She shall have a month to choose , '' said Young , rising from his seat STOP `` At the end of that time she shall give her answer . STOP He was passing through the door , when he turned , with flushed face and flashing eyes STOP `` It were better for you , John Ferrier , '' he thundered , '' that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco , than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four ! STOP With a threatening gesture of his hand , he turned from the door , and Ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path STOP He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees , considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his , and looking up , he saw her standing beside him STOP One glance at her pale , frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed STOP `` I could not help it , '' she said , in answer to his look STOP `` His voice rang through the house STOP Oh , father , father , what shall we do ? STOP `` Do n't you scare yourself , '' he answered , drawing her to him , and passing his broad , rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair STOP `` We 'll fix it up somehow or another STOP You do n't find your fancy kind o ' lessening for this chap , do you ? STOP A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer STOP `` No ; of course not STOP I should n't care to hear you say you did STOP He 's a likely lad , and he 's a Christian , which is more than these folk here , in spite o ' all their praying and preaching STOP There 's a party starting for Nevada to-morrow , and I 'll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in STOP If I know anything o ' that young man , he 'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs . STOP Lucy laughed through her tears at her father 's description STOP `` When he comes , he will advise us for the best STOP But it is for you that I am frightened , dear STOP One hears -- one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet : something terrible always happens to them . STOP `` But we have n't opposed him yet , '' her father answered STOP `` It will be time to look out for squalls when we do STOP We have a clear month before us ; at the end of that , I guess we had best shin out of Utah . STOP `` Leave Utah ! STOP `` That 's about the size of it . STOP `` But the farm ? STOP `` We will raise as much as we can in money , and let the rest go STOP To tell the truth , Lucy , it is n't the first time I have thought of doing it STOP I do n't care about knuckling under to any man , as these folk do to their darned prophet STOP I 'm a free-born American , and it 's all new to me STOP Guess I 'm too old to learn STOP If he comes browsing about this farm , he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction . STOP `` But they wo n't let us leave , '' his daughter objected STOP `` Wait till Jefferson comes , and we 'll soon manage that STOP In the meantime , do n't you fret yourself , my dearie , and do n't get your eyes swelled up , else he 'll be walking into me when he sees you STOP There 's nothing to be afeared about , and there 's no danger at all . STOP John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone , but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night , and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom STOP STOP A FLIGHT FOR LIFE STOP ON the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet , John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City , and having found his acquaintance , who was bound for the Nevada Mountains , he entrusted him with his message to Jefferson Hope STOP In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them , and how necessary it was that he should return STOP Having done thus he felt easier in his mind , and returned home with a lighter heart STOP As he approached his farm , he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate STOP Still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room STOP One , with a long pale face , was leaning back in the rocking-chair , with his feet cocked up upon the stove STOP The other , a bull-necked youth with coarse bloated features , was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pocket , whistling a popular hymn STOP Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered , and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation STOP `` Maybe you do n't know us , '' he said STOP `` This here is the son of Elder Drebber , and I 'm Joseph Stangerson , who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold . STOP `` As He will all the nations in His own good time , '' said the other in a nasal voice ; `` He grindeth slowly but exceeding small . STOP John Ferrier bowed coldly STOP He had guessed who his visitors were STOP `` We have come , '' continued Stangerson , `` at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her STOP As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven , it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one . STOP `` Nay , nay , Brother Stangerson , '' cried the other ; `` the question is not how many wives we have , but how many we can keep STOP My father has now given over his mills to me , and I am the richer man . STOP `` But my prospects are better , '' said the other , warmly STOP `` When the Lord removes my father , I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory STOP Then I am your elder , and am higher in the Church . STOP `` It will be for the maiden to decide , '' rejoined young Drebber , smirking at his own reflection in the glass STOP `` We will leave it all to her decision . STOP During this dialogue , John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway , hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors STOP `` Look here , '' he said at last , striding up to them , `` when my daughter summons you , you can come , but until then I do n't want to see your faces again . STOP The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement STOP In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden 's hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father STOP `` There are two ways out of the room , '' cried Ferrier ; `` there is the door , and there is the window STOP Which do you care to use ? STOP His brown face looked so savage , and his gaunt hands so threatening , that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat STOP The old farmer followed them to the door STOP `` Let me know when you have settled which it is to be , '' he said , sardonically STOP `` You shall smart for this ! STOP Stangerson cried , white with rage STOP `` You have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four STOP You shall rue it to the end of your days . STOP `` The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you , '' cried young Drebber ; `` He will arise and smite you ! STOP `` Then I 'll start the smiting , '' exclaimed Ferrier furiously , and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him STOP Before he could escape from her , the clatter of horses' hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach STOP `` The young canting rascals ! STOP he exclaimed , wiping the perspiration from his forehead ; `` I would sooner see you in your grave , my girl , than the wife of either of them . STOP `` And so should I , father , '' she answered , with spirit ; `` but Jefferson will soon be here . STOP `` Yes STOP It will not be long before he comes STOP The sooner the better , for we do not know what their next move may be . STOP It was , indeed , high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter STOP In the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders STOP If minor errors were punished so sternly , what would be the fate of this arch rebel STOP Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him STOP Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now , and their goods given over to the Church STOP He was a brave man , but he trembled at the vague , shadowy terrors which hung over him STOP Any known danger he could face with a firm lip , but this suspense was unnerving STOP He concealed his fears from his daughter , however , and affected to make light of the whole matter , though she , with the keen eye of love , saw plainly that he was ill at ease STOP He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct , and he was not mistaken , though it came in an unlooked-for manner STOP Upon rising next morning he found , to his surprise , a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest STOP On it was printed , in bold straggling letters : -- '' Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment , and then -- -- '' The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been STOP How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely , for his servants slept in an outhouse , and the doors and windows had all been secured STOP He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter , but the incident struck a chill into his heart STOP The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised STOP What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers STOP The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart , and he could never have known who had slain him STOP Still more shaken was he next morning STOP They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards STOP In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled , with a burned stick apparently , the number 28 STOP To his daughter it was unintelligible , and he did not enlighten her STOP That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward STOP He saw and he heard nothing , and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door STOP Thus day followed day ; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register , and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace STOP Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls , sometimes upon the floors , occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings STOP With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded STOP A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them STOP He became haggard and restless , and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature STOP He had but one hope in life now , and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada STOP Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten , but there was no news of the absentee STOP One by one the numbers dwindled down , and still there came no sign of him STOP Whenever a horseman clattered down the road , or a driver shouted at his team , the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last STOP At last , when he saw five give way to four and that again to three , he lost heart , and abandoned all hope of escape STOP Single-handed , and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement , he knew that he was powerless STOP The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded , and none could pass along them without an order from the Council STOP Turn which way he would , there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him STOP Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter 's dishonour STOP He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles , and searching vainly for some way out of them STOP That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house , and the next day would be the last of the allotted time STOP What was to happen then STOP All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination STOP And his daughter -- what was to become of her after he was gone STOP Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them STOP He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence STOP What was that STOP In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound -- low , but very distinct in the quiet of the night STOP It came from the door of the house STOP Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently STOP There was a pause for a few moments , and then the low insidious sound was repeated STOP Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door STOP Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal STOP Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived STOP John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart STOP Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open STOP Outside all was calm and quiet STOP The night was fine , and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead STOP The little front garden lay before the farmer 's eyes bounded by the fence and gate , but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen STOP With a sigh of relief , Ferrier looked to right and to left , until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground , with arms and legs all asprawl STOP So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out STOP His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man , but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent STOP Once within the house the man sprang to his feet , closed the door , and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope STOP `` Good God ! STOP gasped John Ferrier STOP `` How you scared me STOP Whatever made you come in like that . STOP `` Give me food , '' the other said , hoarsely STOP `` I have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours . STOP He flung himself upon the [ 21 ] cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host's supper , and devoured it voraciously STOP `` Does Lucy bear up well ? STOP he asked , when he had satisfied his hunger STOP `` Yes STOP She does not know the danger , '' her father answered STOP `` That is well STOP The house is watched on every side STOP That is why I crawled my way up to it STOP They may be darned sharp , but they 're not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter . STOP John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally STOP He seized the young man 's leathery hand and wrung it cordially STOP `` You 're a man to be proud of , '' he said STOP `` There are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles . STOP `` You 've hit it there , pard , '' the young hunter answered STOP `` I have a respect for you , but if you were alone in this business I 'd think twice before I put my head into such a hornet 's nest STOP It 's Lucy that brings me here , and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o ' the Hope family in Utah . STOP `` What are we to do ? STOP `` To-morrow is your last day , and unless you act to-night you are lost STOP I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine STOP How much money have you ? STOP `` Two thousand dollars in gold , and five in notes . STOP `` That will do STOP I have as much more to add to it STOP We must push for Carson City through the mountains STOP You had best wake Lucy STOP It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house . STOP While Ferrier was absent , preparing his daughter for the approaching journey , Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel , and filled a stoneware jar with water , for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between STOP He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start STOP The greeting between the lovers was warm , but brief , for minutes were precious , and there was much to be done STOP `` We must make our start at once , '' said Jefferson Hope , speaking in a low but resolute voice , like one who realizes the greatness of the peril , but has steeled his heart to meet it STOP `` The front and back entrances are watched , but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields STOP Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting STOP By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains . STOP `` What if we are stopped , '' asked Ferrier STOP Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic STOP `` If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us , '' he said with a sinister smile STOP The lights inside the house had all been extinguished , and from the darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own , and which he was now about to abandon for ever STOP He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice , however , and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes STOP All looked so peaceful and happy , the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land , that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all STOP Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head STOP Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes , Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water , while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions STOP Opening the window very slowly and carefully , they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night , and then one by one passed through into the little garden STOP With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it , and gained the shelter of the hedge , which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields STOP They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow , where they lay silent and trembling STOP It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx STOP He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them , which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance STOP At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making , and uttered the plaintive signal cry again , on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity STOP `` To-morrow at midnight , '' said the first who appeared to be in authority STOP `` When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times . STOP `` It is well , '' returned the other STOP `` Shall I tell Brother Drebber ? STOP `` Pass it on to him , and from him to the others STOP Nine to seven ! STOP `` Seven to five ! STOP repeated the other , and the two figures flitted away in different directions STOP Their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign STOP The instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance , Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet , and helping his companions through the gap , led the way across the fields at the top of his speed , supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her STOP `` Hurry on STOP hurry on ! STOP he gasped from time to time STOP `` We are through the line of sentinels STOP Everything depends on speed STOP Hurry on ! STOP Once on the high road they made rapid progress STOP Only once did they meet anyone , and then they managed to slip into a field , and so avoid recognition STOP Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains STOP Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness , and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Canon in which the horses were awaiting them STOP With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse , until he came to the retired corner , screened with rocks , where the faithful animals had been picketed STOP The girl was placed upon the mule , and old Ferrier upon one of the horses , with his money-bag , while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path STOP It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest moods STOP On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more , black , stern , and menacing , with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster STOP On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible STOP Between the two ran the irregular track , so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file , and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all STOP Yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties , the hearts of the fugitives were light within them , for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying STOP They soon had a proof , however , that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints STOP They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry , and pointed upwards STOP On a rock which overlooked the track , showing out dark and plain against the sky , there stood a solitary sentinel STOP He saw them as soon as they perceived him , and his military challenge of `` Who goes there ? STOP rang through the silent ravine STOP `` Travellers for Nevada , '' said Jefferson Hope , with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle STOP They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun , and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply STOP `` By whose permission ? STOP he asked STOP `` The Holy Four , '' answered Ferrier STOP His Mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer STOP `` Nine from seven , '' cried the sentinel STOP `` Seven from five , '' returned Jefferson Hope promptly , remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden STOP `` Pass , and the Lord go with you , '' said the voice from above STOP Beyond his post the path broadened out , and the horses were able to break into a trot STOP Looking back , they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun , and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people , and that freedom lay before them STOP STOP THE AVENGING ANGELS STOP ALL night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and rock-strewn paths STOP More than once they lost their way , but Hope's intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more STOP When morning broke , a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them STOP In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in , peeping over each other 's shoulders to the far horizon STOP So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them , that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads , and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them STOP Nor was the fear entirely an illusion , for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner STOP Even as they passed , a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges , and startled the weary horses into a gallop STOP As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon , the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other , like lamps at a festival , until they were all ruddy and glowing STOP The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy STOP At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses , while they partook of a hasty breakfast STOP Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer , but Jefferson Hope was inexorable STOP `` They will be upon our track by this time , '' he said STOP `` Everything depends upon our speed STOP Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives . STOP During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles , and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies STOP At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag , where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind , and there huddled together for warmth , they enjoyed a few hours ' sleep STOP Before daybreak , however , they were up and on their way once more STOP They had seen no signs of any pursuers , and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred STOP He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach , or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them STOP About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out STOP This gave the hunter little uneasiness , however , for there was game to be had among the mountains , and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life STOP Choosing a sheltered nook , he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire , at which his companions might warm themselves , for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level , and the air was bitter and keen STOP Having tethered the horses , and bade Lucy adieu , he threw his gun over his shoulder , and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way STOP Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire , while the three animals stood motionless in the back-ground STOP Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view STOP He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success , though from the marks upon the bark of the trees , and other indications , he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity STOP At last , after two or three hours ' fruitless search , he was thinking of turning back in despair , when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart STOP On the edge of a jutting pinnacle , three or four hundred feet above him , there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance , but armed with a pair of gigantic horns STOP The big-horn -- for so it is called -- was acting , probably , as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter ; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction , and had not perceived him STOP Lying on his face , he rested his rifle upon a rock , and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger STOP The animal sprang into the air , tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice , and then came crashing down into the valley beneath STOP The creature was too unwieldy to lift , so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank STOP With this trophy over his shoulder , he hastened to retrace his steps , for the evening was already drawing in STOP He had hardly started , however , before he realized the difficulty which faced him STOP In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him , and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken STOP The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges , which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other STOP He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before STOP Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn , he tried another , but with the same result STOP Night was coming on rapidly , and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him STOP Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track , for the moon had not yet risen , and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound STOP Weighed down with his burden , and weary from his exertions , he stumbled along , keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy , and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey STOP He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them STOP Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it STOP They must , he reflected , be awaiting him anxiously , for he had been absent nearly five hours STOP In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming STOP He paused and listened for an answer STOP None came save his own cry , which clattered up the dreary silent ravines , and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions STOP Again he shouted , even louder than before , and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago STOP A vague , nameless dread came over him , and he hurried onwards frantically , dropping the precious food in his agitation STOP When he turned the corner , he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit STOP There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there , but it had evidently not been tended since his departure STOP The same dead silence still reigned all round STOP With his fears all changed to convictions , he hurried on STOP There was no living creature near the remains of the fire : animals , man , maiden , all were gone STOP It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence -- a disaster which had embraced them all , and yet had left no traces behind it STOP Bewildered and stunned by this blow , Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round , and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling STOP He was essentially a man of action , however , and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence STOP Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire , he blew it into a flame , and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp STOP The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses , showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives , and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City STOP Had they carried back both of his companions with them STOP Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so , when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him STOP A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil , which had assuredly not been there before STOP There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave STOP As the young hunter approached it , he perceived that a stick had been planted on it , with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it STOP The inscription upon the paper was brief , but to the point : JOHN FERRIER , FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY , [ 22 ] Died August 4th , 1860 STOP The sturdy old man , whom he had left so short a time before , was gone , then , and this was all his epitaph STOP Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave , but there was no sign of one STOP Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny , by becoming one of the harem of the Elder 's son STOP As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate , and his own powerlessness to prevent it , he wished that he , too , was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place STOP Again , however , his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair STOP If there was nothing else left to him , he could at least devote his life to revenge STOP With indomitable patience and perseverance , Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness , which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived STOP As he stood by the desolate fire , he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution , brought by his own hand upon his enemies STOP His strong will and untiring energy should , he determined , be devoted to that one end STOP With a grim , white face , he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food , and having stirred up the smouldering fire , he cooked enough to last him for a few days STOP This he made up into a bundle , and , tired as he was , he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels STOP For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback STOP At night he flung himself down among the rocks , and snatched a few hours of sleep ; but before daybreak he was always well on his way STOP On the sixth day , he reached the Eagle Canon , from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight STOP Thence he could look down upon the home of the saints STOP Worn and exhausted , he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him STOP As he looked at it , he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets , and other signs of festivity STOP He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse 's hoofs , and saw a mounted man riding towards him STOP As he approached , he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper , to whom he had rendered services at different times STOP He therefore accosted him when he got up to him , with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier 's fate had been STOP `` I am Jefferson Hope , '' he said STOP `` You remember me . STOP The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment -- indeed , it was difficult to recognize in this tattered , unkempt wanderer , with ghastly white face and fierce , wild eyes , the spruce young hunter of former days STOP Having , however , at last , satisfied himself as to his identity , the man 's surprise changed to consternation STOP `` You are mad to come here , '' he cried STOP `` It is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you STOP There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away . STOP `` I do n't fear them , or their warrant , '' Hope said , earnestly STOP `` You must know something of this matter , Cowper STOP I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions STOP We have always been friends STOP For God 's sake , do n't refuse to answer me . STOP `` What is it ? STOP the Mormon asked uneasily STOP `` Be quick STOP The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes . STOP `` What has become of Lucy Ferrier ? STOP `` She was married yesterday to young Drebber STOP Hold up , man , hold up , you have no life left in you . STOP `` Do n't mind me , '' said Hope faintly STOP He was white to the very lips , and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning STOP `` Married , you say ? STOP `` Married yesterday -- that 's what those flags are for on the Endowment House STOP There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her STOP They 'd both been in the party that followed them , and Stangerson had shot her father , which seemed to give him the best claim ; but when they argued it out in council , Drebber 's party was the stronger , so the Prophet gave her over to him STOP No one wo n't have her very long though , for I saw death in her face yesterday STOP She is more like a ghost than a woman STOP Are you off , then ? STOP `` Yes , I am off , '' said Jefferson Hope , who had risen from his seat STOP His face might have been chiselled out of marble , so hard and set was its expression , while its eyes glowed with a baleful light STOP `` Where are you going ? STOP `` Never mind , '' he answered ; and , slinging his weapon over his shoulder , strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts STOP Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself STOP The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled STOP Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced , poor Lucy never held up her head again , but pined away and died within a month STOP Her sottish husband , who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier 's property , did not affect any great grief at his bereavement ; but his other wives mourned over her , and sat up with her the night before the burial , as is the Mormon custom STOP They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning , when , to their inexpressible fear and astonishment , the door was flung open , and a savage-looking , weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room STOP Without a glance or a word to the cowering women , he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier STOP Stooping over her , he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead , and then , snatching up her hand , he took the wedding-ring from her finger STOP `` She shall not be buried in that , '' he cried with a fierce snarl , and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone STOP So strange and so brief was the episode , that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it , had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared STOP For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains , leading a strange wild life , and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him STOP Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs , and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges STOP Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him STOP On another occasion , as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him , and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face STOP The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives , and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy , but always without success STOP Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall , and of having their houses guarded STOP After a time they were able to relax these measures , for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent , and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness STOP Far from doing so , it had , if anything , augmented it STOP The hunter 's mind was of a hard , unyielding nature , and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion STOP He was , however , above all things practical STOP He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it STOP Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out STOP If he died like a dog among the mountains , what was to become of his revenge then STOP And yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted STOP He felt that that was to play his enemy's game , so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines , there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation STOP His intention had been to be absent a year at the most , but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five STOP At the end of that time , however , his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier 's grave STOP Disguised , and under an assumed name , he returned to Salt Lake City , careless what became of his own life , as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice STOP There he found evil tidings awaiting him STOP There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before , some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders , and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents , who had left Utah and become Gentiles STOP Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson ; and no one knew whither they had gone STOP Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money , and that he had departed a wealthy man , while his companion , Stangerson , was comparatively poor STOP There was no clue at all , however , as to their whereabouts STOP Many a man , however vindictive , would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty , but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment STOP With the small competence he possessed , eked out by such employment as he could pick up , he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies STOP Year passed into year , his black hair turned grizzled , but still he wandered on , a human bloodhound , with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life STOP At last his perseverance was rewarded STOP It was but a glance of a face in a window , but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of STOP He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged STOP It chanced , however , that Drebber , looking from his window , had recognized the vagrant in the street , and had read murder in his eyes STOP He hurried before a justice of the peace , accompanied by Stangerson , who had become his private secretary , and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival STOP That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody , and not being able to find sureties , was detained for some weeks STOP When at last he was liberated , it was only to find that Drebber 's house was deserted , and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe STOP Again the avenger had been foiled , and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit STOP Funds were wanting , however , and for some time he had to return to work , saving every dollar for his approaching journey STOP At last , having collected enough to keep life in him , he departed for Europe , and tracked his enemies from city to city , working his way in any menial capacity , but never overtaking the fugitives STOP When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris ; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen STOP At the Danish capital he was again a few days late , for they had journeyed on to London , where he at last succeeded in running them to earth STOP As to what occurred there , we can not do better than quote the old hunter 's own account , as duly recorded in Dr. Watson 's Journal , to which we are already under such obligations STOP STOP A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON , M.D STOP OUR prisoner 's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves , for on finding himself powerless , he smiled in an affable manner , and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle STOP `` I guess you 're going to take me to the police-station , '' he remarked to Sherlock Holmes STOP `` My cab 's at the door STOP If you 'll loose my legs I 'll walk down to it STOP I 'm not so light to lift as I used to be . STOP Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one ; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word , and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles STOP [ 23 ] He rose and stretched his legs , as though to assure himself that they were free once more STOP I remember that I thought to myself , as I eyed him , that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man ; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength STOP `` If there 's a vacant place for a chief of the police , I reckon you are the man for it , '' he said , gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger STOP `` The way you kept on my trail was a caution . STOP `` You had better come with me , '' said Holmes to the two detectives STOP `` I can drive you , '' said Lestrade STOP `` Good STOP and Gregson can come inside with me STOP You too , Doctor , you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us . STOP I assented gladly , and we all descended together STOP Our prisoner made no attempt at escape , but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his , and we followed him STOP Lestrade mounted the box , whipped up the horse , and brought us in a very short time to our destination STOP We were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner 's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged STOP The official was a white-faced unemotional man , who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way STOP `` The prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week , '' he said ; `` in the mean time , Mr. Jefferson Hope , have you anything that you wish to say STOP I must warn you that your words will be taken down , and may be used against you . STOP `` I 've got a good deal to say , '' our prisoner said slowly STOP `` I want to tell you gentlemen all about it . STOP `` Had n't you better reserve that for your trial ? STOP asked the Inspector STOP `` I may never be tried , '' he answered STOP `` You need n't look startled STOP It is n't suicide I am thinking of STOP Are you a Doctor ? STOP He turned his fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question STOP `` Yes ; I am , '' I answered STOP `` Then put your hand here , '' he said , with a smile , motioning with his manacled wrists towards his chest STOP I did so ; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside STOP The walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work STOP In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source STOP `` Why , '' I cried , `` you have an aortic aneurism ! STOP `` That 's what they call it , '' he said , placidly STOP `` I went to a Doctor last week about it , and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed STOP It has been getting worse for years STOP I got it from over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains STOP I 've done my work now , and I do n't care how soon I go , but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me STOP I do n't want to be remembered as a common cut-throat . STOP The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him to tell his story STOP `` Do you consider , Doctor , that there is immediate danger ? STOP the former asked , [ 24 ] '' Most certainly there is , '' I answered STOP `` In that case it is clearly our duty , in the interests of justice , to take his statement , '' said the Inspector STOP `` You are at liberty , sir , to give your account , which I again warn you will be taken down . STOP `` I 'll sit down , with your leave , '' the prisoner said , suiting the action to the word STOP `` This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired , and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters STOP I 'm on the brink of the grave , and I am not likely to lie to you STOP Every word I say is the absolute truth , and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me . STOP With these words , Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement STOP He spoke in a calm and methodical manner , as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough STOP I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account , for I have had access to Lestrade 's note-book , in which the prisoner 's words were taken down exactly as they were uttered STOP `` It do n't much matter to you why I hated these men , '' he said ; `` it's enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings -- a father and a daughter -- and that they had , therefore , forfeited their own lives STOP After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime , it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court STOP I knew of their guilt though , and I determined that I should be judge , jury , and executioner all rolled into one STOP You 'd have done the same , if you have any manhood in you , if you had been in my place STOP `` That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago STOP She was forced into marrying that same Drebber , and broke her heart over it STOP I took the marriage ring from her dead finger , and I vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring , and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished STOP I have carried it about with me , and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until I caught them STOP They thought to tire me out , but they could not do it STOP If I die to-morrow , as is likely enough , I die knowing that my work in this world is done , and well done STOP They have perished , and by my hand STOP There is nothing left for me to hope for , or to desire STOP `` They were rich and I was poor , so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them STOP When I got to London my pocket was about empty , and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living STOP Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking , so I applied at a cabowner 's office , and soon got employment STOP I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner , and whatever was over that I might keep for myself STOP There was seldom much over , but I managed to scrape along somehow STOP The hardest job was to learn my way about , for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived , this city is the most confusing STOP I had a map beside me though , and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations , I got on pretty well STOP `` It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living ; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them STOP They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell , over on the other side of the river STOP When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy STOP I had grown my beard , and there was no chance of their recognizing me STOP I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity STOP I was determined that they should not escape me again STOP `` They were very near doing it for all that STOP Go where they would about London , I was always at their heels STOP Sometimes I followed them on my cab , and sometimes on foot , but the former was the best , for then they could not get away from me STOP It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything , so that I began to get behind hand with my employer STOP I did not mind that , however , as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted STOP `` They were very cunning , though STOP They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed , for they would never go out alone , and never after nightfall STOP During two weeks I drove behind them every day , and never once saw them separate STOP Drebber himself was drunk half the time , but Stangerson was not to be caught napping STOP I watched them late and early , but never saw the ghost of a chance ; but I was not discouraged , for something told me that the hour had almost come STOP My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone STOP `` At last , one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace , as the street was called in which they boarded , when I saw a cab drive up to their door STOP Presently some luggage was brought out , and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it , and drove off STOP I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them , feeling very ill at ease , for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters STOP At Euston Station they got out , and I left a boy to hold my horse , and followed them on to the platform STOP I heard them ask for the Liverpool train , and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours STOP Stangerson seemed to be put out at that , but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise STOP I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them STOP Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do , and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him STOP His companion remonstrated with him , and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together STOP Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one , and that he must go alone STOP I could not catch what Stangerson said to that , but the other burst out swearing , and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant , and that he must not presume to dictate to him STOP On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job , and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday 's Private Hotel ; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven , and made his way out of the station STOP `` The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come STOP I had my enemies within my power STOP Together they could protect each other , but singly they were at my mercy STOP I did not act , however , with undue precipitation STOP My plans were already formed STOP There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him , and why retribution has come upon him STOP I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out STOP It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage STOP It was claimed that same evening , and returned ; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it , and had a duplicate constructed STOP By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption STOP How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve STOP `` He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops , staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them STOP When he came out he staggered in his walk , and was evidently pretty well on STOP There was a hansom just in front of me , and he hailed it STOP I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way STOP We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets , until , to my astonishment , we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded STOP I could not imagine what his intention was in returning there ; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house STOP He entered it , and his hansom drove away STOP Give me a glass of water , if you please STOP My mouth gets dry with the talking . STOP I handed him the glass , and he drank it down STOP `` That 's better , '' he said STOP `` Well , I waited for a quarter of an hour , or more , when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house STOP Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared , one of whom was Drebber , and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before STOP This fellow had Drebber by the collar , and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road STOP 'You hound , ' he cried , shaking his stick at him ; ' I'll teach you to insult an honest girl ! STOP He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel , only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him STOP He ran as far as the corner , and then , seeing my cab , he hailed me and jumped in STOP 'Drive me to Halliday 's Private Hotel , ' said he STOP `` When I had him fairly inside my cab , my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong STOP I drove along slowly , weighing in my own mind what it was best to do STOP I might take him right out into the country , and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him STOP I had almost decided upon this , when he solved the problem for me STOP The craze for drink had seized him again , and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace STOP He went in , leaving word that I should wait for him STOP There he remained until closing time , and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands STOP `` Do n't imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood STOP It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so , but I could not bring myself to do it STOP I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it STOP Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life , I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College STOP One day the professor was lecturing on poisions , [ 25 ] and he showed his students some alkaloid , as he called it , which he had extracted from some South American arrow poison , and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death STOP I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept , and when they were all gone , I helped myself to a little of it STOP I was a fairly good dispenser , so I worked this alkaloid into small , soluble pills , and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison STOP I determined at the time that when I had my chance , my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes , while I ate the pill that remained STOP It would be quite as deadly , and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief STOP From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me , and the time had now come when I was to use them STOP `` It was nearer one than twelve , and a wild , bleak night , blowing hard and raining in torrents STOP Dismal as it was outside , I was glad within -- so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation STOP If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing , and longed for it during twenty long years , and then suddenly found it within your reach , you would understand my feelings STOP I lit a cigar , and puffed at it to steady my nerves , but my hands were trembling , and my temples throbbing with excitement STOP As I drove , I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me , just as plain as I see you all in this room STOP All the way they were ahead of me , one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road STOP `` There was not a soul to be seen , nor a sound to be heard , except the dripping of the rain STOP When I looked in at the window , I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep STOP I shook him by the arm , 'It's time to get out , ' I said STOP `` 'All right , cabby , ' said he STOP `` I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned , for he got out without another word , and followed me down the garden STOP I had to walk beside him to keep him steady , for he was still a little top-heavy STOP When we came to the door , I opened it , and led him into the front room STOP I give you my word that all the way , the father and the daughter were walking in front of us STOP `` 'It 's infernally dark , ' said he , stamping about STOP `` 'We 'll soon have a light , ' I said , striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me STOP 'Now , Enoch Drebber , ' I continued , turning to him , and holding the light to my own face , 'who am I ?

STOP `` He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy , but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me STOP Then I swallowed the other , and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more , waiting to see which was to live and which was to die STOP Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system STOP I laughed as I saw it , and held Lucy 's marriage ring in front of his eyes STOP It was but for a moment , for the action of the alkaloid is rapid STOP A spasm of pain contorted his features ; he threw his hands out in front of him , staggered , and then , with a hoarse cry , fell heavily upon the floor STOP I turned him over with my foot , and placed my hand upon his heart STOP There was no movement STOP He was dead STOP `` The blood had been streaming from my nose , but I had taken no notice of it STOP I do n't know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it STOP Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track , for I felt light-hearted and cheerful STOP I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him , and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it STOP I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners , so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall STOP Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about , and that the night was still very wild STOP I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy 's ring , and found that it was not there STOP I was thunderstruck at this , for it was the only memento that I had of her STOP Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber's body , I drove back , and leaving my cab in a side street , I went boldly up to the house -- for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring STOP When I arrived there , I walked right into the arms of a police-officer who was coming out , and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk STOP `` That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end STOP All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson , and so pay off John Ferrier 's debt STOP I knew that he was staying at Halliday 's Private Hotel , and I hung about all day , but he never came out STOP [ 26 ] fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance STOP He was cunning , was Stangerson , and always on his guard STOP If he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken STOP I soon found out which was the window of his bedroom , and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel , and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn STOP I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before STOP I described Drebber 's death to him , and I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills STOP Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him , he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat STOP In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart STOP It would have been the same in any case , for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison STOP `` I have little more to say , and it 's as well , for I am about done up STOP I went on cabbing it for a day or so , intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America STOP I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope , and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B , Baker Street STOP I went round , suspecting no harm , and the next thing I knew , this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists , and as neatly snackled [ 27 ] as ever I saw in my life STOP That 's the whole of my story , gentlemen STOP You may consider me to be a murderer ; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are . STOP So thrilling had the man 's narrative been , and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed STOP Even the professional detectives , _blase_ as they were in every detail of crime , appeared to be keenly interested in the man 's story STOP When he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of Lestrade 's pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account STOP `` There is only one point on which I should like a little more information , '' Sherlock Holmes said at last STOP `` Who was your accomplice who came for the ring which I advertised ? STOP The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely STOP `` I can tell my own secrets , '' he said , `` but I do n't get other people into trouble STOP I saw your advertisement , and I thought it might be a plant , or it might be the ring which I wanted STOP My friend volunteered to go and see STOP I think you'll own he did it smartly . STOP `` Not a doubt of that , '' said Holmes heartily STOP `` Now , gentlemen , '' the Inspector remarked gravely , `` the forms of the law must be complied with STOP On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates , and your attendance will be required STOP Until then I will be responsible for him . STOP He rang the bell as he spoke , and Jefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders , while my friend and I made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street STOP STOP THE CONCLUSION STOP WE had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the Thursday ; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony STOP A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand , and Jefferson Hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him STOP On the very night after his capture the aneurism burst , and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell , with a placid smile upon his face , as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life , and on work well done STOP `` Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death , '' Holmes remarked , as we chatted it over next evening STOP `` Where will their grand advertisement be now ? STOP `` I do n't see that they had very much to do with his capture , '' I answered STOP `` What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence , '' returned my companion , bitterly STOP `` The question is , what can you make people believe that you have done STOP Never mind , '' he continued , more brightly , after a pause STOP `` I would not have missed the investigation for anything STOP There has been no better case within my recollection STOP Simple as it was , there were several most instructive points about it . STOP `` Simple ! STOP I ejaculated STOP `` Well , really , it can hardly be described as otherwise , '' said Sherlock Holmes , smiling at my surprise STOP `` The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is , that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days . STOP `` That is true , '' said I STOP `` I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance STOP In solving a problem of this sort , the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards STOP That is a very useful accomplishment , and a very easy one , but people do not practise it much STOP In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards , and so the other comes to be neglected STOP There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically . STOP `` I confess , '' said I , `` that I do not quite follow you . STOP `` I hardly expected that you would STOP Let me see if I can make it clearer STOP Most people , if you describe a train of events to them , will tell you what the result would be STOP They can put those events together in their minds , and argue from them that something will come to pass STOP There are few people , however , who , if you told them a result , would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result STOP This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards , or analytically . STOP `` I understand , '' said I STOP `` Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself STOP Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning STOP To begin at the beginning STOP I approached the house , as you know , on foot , and with my mind entirely free from all impressions STOP I naturally began by examining the roadway , and there , as I have already explained to you , I saw clearly the marks of a cab , which , I ascertained by inquiry , must have been there during the night STOP I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels STOP The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman 's brougham STOP `` This was the first point gained STOP I then walked slowly down the garden path , which happened to be composed of a clay soil , peculiarly suitable for taking impressions STOP No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush , but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning STOP There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps STOP Happily , I have always laid great stress upon it , and much practice has made it second nature to me STOP I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables , but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden STOP It was easy to tell that they had been before the others , because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them STOP In this way my second link was formed , which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number , one remarkable for his height ( as I calculated from the length of his stride ) , and the other fashionably dressed , to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots STOP `` On entering the house this last inference was confirmed STOP My well-booted man lay before me STOP The tall one , then , had done the murder , if murder there was STOP There was no wound upon the dead man 's person , but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him STOP Men who die from heart disease , or any sudden natural cause , never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features STOP Having sniffed the dead man 's lips I detected a slightly sour smell , and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him STOP Again , I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face STOP By the method of exclusion , I had arrived at this result , for no other hypothesis would meet the facts STOP Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea STOP The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals STOP The cases of Dolsky in Odessa , and of Leturier in Montpellier , will occur at once to any toxicologist STOP `` And now came the great question as to the reason why STOP Robbery had not been the object of the murder , for nothing was taken STOP Was it politics , then , or was it a woman STOP That was the question which confronted me STOP I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition STOP Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly STOP This murder had , on the contrary , been done most deliberately , and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room , showing that he had been there all the time STOP It must have been a private wrong , and not a political one , which called for such a methodical revenge STOP When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion STOP The thing was too evidently a blind STOP When the ring was found , however , it settled the question STOP Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman STOP It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber 's former career STOP He answered , you remember , in the negative STOP `` I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room , which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer 's height , and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails STOP I had already come to the conclusion , since there were no signs of a struggle , that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer 's nose in his excitement STOP I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet STOP It is seldom that any man , unless he is very full-blooded , breaks out in this way through emotion , so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man STOP Events proved that I had judged correctly STOP `` Having left the house , I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected STOP I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland , limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber STOP The answer was conclusive STOP It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love , named Jefferson Hope , and that this same Hope was at present in Europe STOP I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand , and all that remained was to secure the murderer STOP `` I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber , was none other than the man who had driven the cab STOP The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it STOP Where , then , could the driver be , unless he were inside the house STOP Again , it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes , as it were , of a third person , who was sure to betray him STOP Lastly , supposing one man wished to dog another through London , what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver STOP All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis STOP `` If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be STOP On the contrary , from his point of view , any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself STOP He would , probably , for a time at least , continue to perform his duties STOP There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name STOP Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one STOP I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps , and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted STOP How well they succeeded , and how quickly I took advantage of it , are still fresh in your recollection STOP The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected , but which could hardly in any case have been prevented STOP Through it , as you know , I came into possession of the pills , the existence of which I had already surmised STOP You see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw . STOP `` It is wonderful ! STOP I cried STOP `` Your merits should be publicly recognized STOP You should publish an account of the case STOP If you wo n't , I will for you . STOP `` You may do what you like , Doctor , '' he answered STOP `` See here ! STOP he continued , handing a paper over to me , `` look at this ! STOP It was the _Echo_ for the day , and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question STOP `` The public , '' it said , `` have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man Hope , who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson STOP The details of the case will probably be never known now , though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud , in which love and Mormonism bore a part STOP It seems that both the victims belonged , in their younger days , to the Latter Day Saints , and Hope , the deceased prisoner , hails also from Salt Lake City STOP If the case has had no other effect , it , at least , brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force , and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home , and not to carry them on to British soil STOP It is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard officials , Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson STOP The man was apprehended , it appears , in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes , who has himself , as an amateur , shown some talent in the detective line , and who , with such instructors , may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill STOP It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services . STOP `` Did n't I tell you so when we started ? STOP cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh STOP `` That 's the result of all our Study in Scarlet : to get them a testimonial ! STOP `` Never mind , '' I answered , `` I have all the facts in my journal , and the public shall know them STOP In the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success , like the Roman miser -- `` 'Populus me sibilat , at mihi plaudo Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca .

but painstakingly , and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech STOP I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding STOP THE AUTHOR STOP HUCKLEBERRY FINN Scene : The Mississippi Valley Time : Forty to fifty years ago STOP YOU do n't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ; but that ai n't no matter STOP That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain , and he told the truth , mainly STOP There was things which he stretched , but mainly he told the truth STOP That is nothing STOP I never seen anybody but lied one time or another , without it was Aunt Polly , or the widow , or maybe Mary STOP Aunt Polly -- Tom 's Aunt Polly , she is -- and Mary , and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book , which is mostly a true book , with some stretchers , as I said before STOP Now the way that the book winds up is this : Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave , and it made us rich STOP We got six thousand dollars apiece -- all gold STOP It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up STOP Well , Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest , and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round -- more than a body could tell what to do with STOP The Widow Douglas she took me for her son , and allowed she would sivilize me ; but it was rough living in the house all the time , considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways ; and so when I could n't stand it no longer I lit out STOP I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again , and was free and satisfied STOP But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers , and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable STOP So I went back STOP The widow she cried over me , and called me a poor lost lamb , and she called me a lot of other names , too , but she never meant no harm by it STOP She put me in them new clothes again , and I could n't do nothing but sweat and sweat , and feel all cramped up STOP Well , then , the old thing commenced again STOP The widow rung a bell for supper , and you had to come to time STOP When you got to the table you could n't go right to eating , but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals , though there war n't really anything the matter with them , -- that is , nothing only everything was cooked by itself STOP In a barrel of odds and ends it is different ; things get mixed up , and the juice kind of swaps around , and the things go better STOP After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers , and I was in a sweat to find out all about him ; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time ; so then I did n't care no more about him , because I do n't take no stock in dead people STOP Pretty soon I wanted to smoke , and asked the widow to let me STOP But she would n't STOP She said it was a mean practice and was n't clean , and I must try to not do it any more STOP That is just the way with some people STOP They get down on a thing when they do n't know nothing about it STOP Here she was a-bothering about Moses , which was no kin to her , and no use to anybody , being gone , you see , yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it STOP And she took snuff , too ; of course that was all right , because she done it herself STOP Her sister , Miss Watson , a tolerable slim old maid , with goggles on , had just come to live with her , and took a set at me now with a spelling-book STOP She worked me middling hard for about an hour , and then the widow made her ease up STOP I could n't stood it much longer STOP Then for an hour it was deadly dull , and I was fidgety STOP Miss Watson would say , Do n't put your feet up there , Huckleberry ; and Do n't scrunch up like that , Huckleberry -- set up straight ; and pretty soon she would say , Do n't gap and stretch like that , Huckleberry -- why do n't you try to behave STOP Then she told me all about the bad place , and I said I wished I was there STOP She got mad then , but I did n't mean no harm STOP All I wanted was to go somewheres ; all I wanted was a change , I war n't particular STOP She said it was wicked to say what I said ; said she would n't say it for the whole world ; she was going to live so as to go to the good place STOP Well , I could n't see no advantage in going where she was going , so I made up my mind I would n't try for it STOP But I never said so , because it would only make trouble , and would n't do no good STOP Now she had got a start , and she went on and told me all about the good place STOP She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing , forever and ever STOP So I did n't think much of it STOP But I never said so STOP I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there , and she said not by a considerable sight STOP I was glad about that , because I wanted him and me to be together STOP Miss Watson she kept pecking at me , and it got tiresome and lonesome STOP By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers , and then everybody was off to bed STOP I went up to my room with a piece of candle , and put it on the table STOP Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful , but it war n't no use STOP I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead STOP The stars were shining , and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful ; and I heard an owl , away off , who-whooing about somebody that was dead , and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die ; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me , and I could n't make out what it was , and so it made the cold shivers run over me STOP Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that 's on its mind and ca n't make itself understood , and so ca n't rest easy in its grave , and has to go about that way every night grieving STOP I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company STOP Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder , and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle ; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up STOP I did n't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck , so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me STOP I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time ; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away STOP But I had n't no confidence STOP You do that when you 've lost a horseshoe that you 've found , instead of nailing it up over the door , but I had n't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you 'd killed a spider STOP I set down again , a-shaking all over , and got out my pipe for a smoke ; for the house was all as still as death now , and so the widow wouldn't know STOP Well , after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom -- boom -- boom -- twelve licks ; and all still again -- stiller than ever STOP Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees -- something was a stirring STOP I set still and listened STOP Directly I could just barely hear a me-yow STOP me-yow STOP down there STOP That was good STOP Says I , me-yow STOP me-yow STOP as soft as I could , and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed STOP Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees , and , sure enough , there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me STOP STOP WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow 's garden , stooping down so as the branches would n't scrape our heads STOP When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise STOP We scrouched down and laid still STOP Miss Watson 's big nigger , named Jim , was setting in the kitchen door ; we could see him pretty clear , because there was a light behind him STOP He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute , listening STOP Then he says : Who dah STOP He listened some more ; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us ; we could a touched him , nearly STOP Well , likely it was minutes and minutes that there war n't a sound , and we all there so close together STOP There was a place on my ankle that got to itching , but I das n't scratch it ; and then my ear begun to itch ; and next my back , right between my shoulders STOP Seemed like I 'd die if I could n't scratch STOP Well , I 've noticed that thing plenty times since STOP If you are with the quality , or at a funeral , or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy -- if you are anywheres where it wo n't do for you to scratch , why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places STOP Pretty soon Jim says : Say , who is you STOP Whar is you STOP Dog my cats ef I didn ' hear sumf ' n STOP Well , I know what I 's gwyne to do : I 's gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin STOP So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom STOP He leaned his back up against a tree , and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine STOP My nose begun to itch STOP It itched till the tears come into my eyes STOP But I das n't scratch STOP Then it begun to itch on the inside STOP Next I got to itching underneath STOP I did n't know how I was going to set still STOP This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes ; but it seemed a sight longer than that STOP I was itching in eleven different places now STOP I reckoned I could n't stand it more ' n a minute longer , but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try STOP Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy ; next he begun to snore -- and then I was pretty soon comfortable again STOP Tom he made a sign to me -- kind of a little noise with his mouth -- and we went creeping away on our hands and knees STOP When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me , and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun STOP But I said no ; he might wake and make a disturbance , and then they 'd find out I war n't in STOP Then Tom said he had n't got candles enough , and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more STOP I did n't want him to try STOP I said Jim might wake up and come STOP But Tom wanted to resk it ; so we slid in there and got three candles , and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay STOP Then we got out , and I was in a sweat to get away ; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was , on his hands and knees , and play something on him STOP I waited , and it seemed a good while , everything was so still and lonesome STOP As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path , around the garden fence , and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house STOP Tom said he slipped Jim 's hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him , and Jim stirred a little , but he did n't wake STOP Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance , and rode him all over the State , and then set him under the trees again , and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it STOP And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans ; and , after that , every time he told it he spread it more and more , till by and by he said they rode him all over the world , and tired him most to death , and his back was all over saddle-boils STOP Jim was monstrous proud about it , and he got so he would n't hardly notice the other niggers STOP Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it , and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country STOP Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over , same as if he was a wonder STOP Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire ; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things , Jim would happen in and say , Hm STOP What you know 'bout witches STOP and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat STOP Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string , and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands , and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it ; but he never told what it was he said to it STOP Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had , just for a sight of that five-center piece ; but they would n't touch it , because the devil had had his hands on it STOP Jim was most ruined for a servant , because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches STOP Well , when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling , where there was sick folks , maybe ; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine ; and down by the village was the river , a whole mile broad , and awful still and grand STOP We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers , and two or three more of the boys , hid in the old tanyard STOP So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half , to the big scar on the hillside , and went ashore STOP We went to a clump of bushes , and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret , and then showed them a hole in the hill , right in the thickest part of the bushes STOP Then we lit the candles , and crawled in on our hands and knees STOP We went about two hundred yards , and then the cave opened up STOP Tom poked about amongst the passages , and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you would n't a noticed that there was a hole STOP We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room , all damp and sweaty and cold , and there we stopped STOP Tom says : Now , we 'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer 's Gang STOP Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath , and write his name in blood STOP Everybody was willing STOP So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on , and read it STOP It swore every boy to stick to the band , and never tell any of the secrets ; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band , whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it , and he must n't eat and he must n't sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts , which was the sign of the band STOP And nobody that did n't belong to the band could use that mark , and if he did he must be sued ; and if he done it again he must be killed STOP And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets , he must have his throat cut , and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around , and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang , but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever STOP Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath , and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head STOP He said , some of it , but the rest was out of pirate-books and robber-books , and every gang that was high-toned had it STOP Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told the secrets STOP Tom said it was a good idea , so he took a pencil and wrote it in STOP Then Ben Rogers says : Here 's Huck Finn , he hai n't got no family ; what you going to do 'bout him STOP Well , hai n't he got a father STOP says Tom Sawyer STOP Yes , he 's got a father , but you ca n't never find him these days STOP He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard , but he hai n't been seen in these parts for a year or more STOP They talked it over , and they was going to rule me out , because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill , or else it would n't be fair and square for the others STOP Well , nobody could think of anything to do -- everybody was stumped , and set still STOP I was most ready to cry ; but all at once I thought of a way , and so I offered them Miss Watson -- they could kill her STOP Everybody said : Oh , she 'll do STOP That 's all right STOP Huck can come in STOP Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with , and I made my mark on the paper STOP Now , says Ben Rogers , what 's the line of business of this Gang STOP Nothing only robbery and murder , Tom said STOP But who are we going to rob ? -- houses , or cattle , or -- Stuff STOP stealing cattle and such things ai n't robbery ; it 's burglary , says Tom Sawyer STOP We ai n't burglars STOP That ai n't no sort of style STOP We are highwaymen STOP We stop stages and carriages on the road , with masks on , and kill the people and take their watches and money STOP Must we always kill the people STOP Oh , certainly STOP It 's best STOP Some authorities think different , but mostly it 's considered best to kill them -- except some that you bring to the cave here , and keep them till they 're ransomed STOP Ransomed STOP What 's that STOP I do n't know STOP But that 's what they do STOP I 've seen it in books ; and so of course that 's what we 've got to do STOP But how can we do it if we do n't know what it is STOP Why , blame it all , we 've _got_ to do it STOP Do n't I tell you it 's in the books STOP Do you want to go to doing different from what 's in the books , and get things all muddled up STOP Oh , that 's all very fine to _say_ , Tom Sawyer , but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we do n't know how to do it to them ? -- that 's the thing I want to get at STOP Now , what do you reckon it is STOP Well , I do n't know STOP But per'aps if we keep them till they 're ransomed , it means that we keep them till they 're dead STOP Now , that 's something _like_ STOP That 'll answer STOP Why could n't you said that before STOP We 'll keep them till they 're ransomed to death ; and a bothersome lot they 'll be , too -- eating up everything , and always trying to get loose STOP How you talk , Ben Rogers STOP How can they get loose when there 's a guard over them , ready to shoot them down if they move a peg STOP A guard STOP Well , that _is_ good STOP So somebody 's got to set up all night and never get any sleep , just so as to watch them STOP I think that's foolishness STOP Why ca n't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here STOP Because it ai n't in the books so -- that 's why STOP Now , Ben Rogers , do you want to do things regular , or do n't you ? -- that 's the idea STOP Do n't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what 's the correct thing to do STOP Do you reckon _you_ can learn 'em anything STOP Not by a good deal STOP No , sir , we 'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way STOP All right STOP I do n't mind ; but I say it 's a fool way , anyhow STOP Say , do we kill the women , too STOP Well , Ben Rogers , if I was as ignorant as you I would n't let on STOP Kill the women STOP No ; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that STOP You fetch them to the cave , and you 're always as polite as pie to them ; and by and by they fall in love with you , and never want to go home any more STOP Well , if that 's the way I 'm agreed , but I do n't take no stock in it STOP Mighty soon we 'll have the cave so cluttered up with women , and fellows waiting to be ransomed , that there wo n't be no place for the robbers STOP But go ahead , I ai n't got nothing to say STOP Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now , and when they waked him up he was scared , and cried , and said he wanted to go home to his ma , and didn't want to be a robber any more STOP So they all made fun of him , and called him cry-baby , and that made him mad , and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets STOP But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet , and said we would all go home and meet next week , and rob somebody and kill some people STOP Ben Rogers said he could n't get out much , only Sundays , and so he wanted to begin next Sunday ; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday , and that settled the thing STOP They agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could , and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang , and so started home STOP I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking STOP My new clothes was all greased up and clayey , and I was dog-tired STOP STOP WELL , I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes ; but the widow she did n't scold , but only cleaned off the grease and clay , and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could STOP Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed , but nothing come of it STOP She told me to pray every day , and whatever I asked for I would get it STOP But it war n't so STOP I tried it STOP Once I got a fish-line , but no hooks STOP It war n't any good to me without hooks STOP I tried for the hooks three or four times , but somehow I could n't make it work STOP By and by , one day , I asked Miss Watson to try for me , but she said I was a fool STOP She never told me why , and I could n't make it out no way STOP I set down one time back in the woods , and had a long think about it STOP I says to myself , if a body can get anything they pray for , why don't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork STOP Why ca n't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole STOP Why ca n't Miss Watson fat up STOP No , says I to my self , there ai n't nothing in it STOP I went and told the widow about it , and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was spiritual gifts STOP This was too many for me , but she told me what she meant -- I must help other people , and do everything I could for other people , and look out for them all the time , and never think about myself STOP This was including Miss Watson , as I took it STOP I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time , but I could n't see no advantage about it -- except for the other people ; so at last I reckoned I would n't worry about it any more , but just let it go STOP Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body 's mouth water ; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again STOP I judged I could see that there was two Providences , and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow 's Providence , but if Miss Watson 's got him there war n't no help for him any more STOP I thought it all out , and reckoned I would belong to the widow 's if he wanted me , though I could n't make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before , seeing I was so ignorant , and so kind of low-down and ornery STOP Pap he had n't been seen for more than a year , and that was comfortable for me ; I did n't want to see him no more STOP He used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me ; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around STOP Well , about this time he was found in the river drownded , about twelve mile above town , so people said STOP They judged it was him , anyway ; said this drownded man was just his size , and was ragged , and had uncommon long hair , which was all like pap ; but they could n't make nothing out of the face , because it had been in the water so long it war n't much like a face at all STOP They said he was floating on his back in the water STOP They took him and buried him on the bank STOP But I war n't comfortable long , because I happened to think of something STOP I knowed mighty well that a drownded man do n't float on his back , but on his face STOP So I knowed , then , that this war n't pap , but a woman dressed up in a man 's clothes STOP So I was uncomfortable again STOP I judged the old man would turn up again by and by , though I wished he would n't STOP We played robber now and then about a month , and then I resigned STOP All the boys did STOP We had n't robbed nobody , had n't killed any people , but only just pretended STOP We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market , but we never hived any of them STOP Tom Sawyer called the hogs ingots , and he called the turnips and stuff julery , and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done , and how many people we had killed and marked STOP But I could n't see no profit in it STOP One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick , which he called a slogan ( which was the sign for the Gang to get together ) , and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants , and six hundred camels , and over a thousand sumter mules , all loaded down with di'monds , and they did n't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers , and so we would lay in ambuscade , as he called it , and kill the lot and scoop the things STOP He said we must slick up our swords and guns , and get ready STOP He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it , though they was only lath and broomsticks , and you might scour at them till you rotted , and then they war n't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before STOP I did n't believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs , but I wanted to see the camels and elephants , so I was on hand next day , Saturday , in the ambuscade ; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill STOP But there warn't no Spaniards and A-rabs , and there war n't no camels nor no elephants STOP It war n't anything but a Sunday-school picnic , and only a primer-class at that STOP We busted it up , and chased the children up the hollow ; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam , though Ben Rogers got a rag doll , and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract ; and then the teacher charged in , and made us drop everything and cut STOP I did n't see no di'monds , and I told Tom Sawyer so STOP He said there was loads of them there , anyway ; and he said there was A-rabs there , too , and elephants and things STOP I said , why could n't we see them , then STOP He said if I war n't so ignorant , but had read a book called Don Quixote , I would know without asking STOP He said it was all done by enchantment STOP He said there was hundreds of soldiers there , and elephants and treasure , and so on , but we had enemies which he called magicians ; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school , just out of spite STOP I said , all right ; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians STOP Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull STOP Why , said he , a magician could call up a lot of genies , and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson STOP They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church STOP Well , I says , s'pose we got some genies to help _us_ -- ca n't we lick the other crowd then STOP How you going to get them STOP I do n't know STOP How do _they_ get them STOP Why , they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring , and then the genies come tearing in , with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the smoke a-rolling , and everything they 're told to do they up and do it STOP They do n't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots , and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it -- or any other man STOP Who makes them tear around so STOP Why , whoever rubs the lamp or the ring STOP They belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring , and they 've got to do whatever he says STOP If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds , and fill it full of chewing-gum , or whatever you want , and fetch an emperor's daughter from China for you to marry , they 've got to do it -- and they've got to do it before sun-up next morning , too STOP And more : they 've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it , you understand STOP Well , says I , I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping the palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that STOP And what's more -- if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp STOP How you talk , Huck Finn STOP Why , you 'd _have_ to come when he rubbed it , whether you wanted to or not STOP What STOP and I as high as a tree and as big as a church STOP All right , then ; I _would_ come ; but I lay I 'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country STOP Shucks , it ai n't no use to talk to you , Huck Finn STOP You do n't seem to know anything , somehow -- perfect saphead STOP I thought all this over for two or three days , and then I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it STOP I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring , and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun , calculating to build a palace and sell it ; but it warn't no use , none of the genies come STOP So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer 's lies STOP I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the elephants , but as for me I think different STOP It had all the marks of a Sunday-school STOP STOP WELL , three or four months run along , and it was well into the winter now STOP I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little , and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five , and I do n't reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever STOP I do n't take no stock in mathematics , anyway STOP At first I hated the school , but by and by I got so I could stand it STOP Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey , and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up STOP So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be STOP I was getting sort of used to the widow 's ways , too , and they war n't so raspy on me STOP Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly , but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes , and so that was a rest to me STOP I liked the old ways best , but I was getting so I liked the new ones , too , a little bit STOP The widow said I was coming along slow but sure , and doing very satisfactory STOP She said she war n't ashamed of me STOP One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast STOP I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck , but Miss Watson was in ahead of me , and crossed me off STOP She says , Take your hands away , Huckleberry ; what a mess you are always making STOP The widow put in a good word for me , but that war n't going to keep off the bad luck , I knowed that well enough STOP I started out , after breakfast , feeling worried and shaky , and wondering where it was going to fall on me , and what it was going to be STOP There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck , but this was n't one of them kind ; so I never tried to do anything , but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out STOP I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence STOP There was an inch of new snow on the ground , and I seen somebody 's tracks STOP They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while , and then went on around the garden fence STOP It was funny they had n't come in , after standing around so STOP I could n't make it out STOP It was very curious , somehow STOP I was going to follow around , but I stooped down to look at the tracks first STOP I didn't notice anything at first , but next I did STOP There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails , to keep off the devil STOP I was up in a second and shinning down the hill STOP I looked over my shoulder every now and then , but I did n't see nobody STOP I was at Judge Thatcher 's as quick as I could get there STOP He said : Why , my boy , you are all out of breath STOP Did you come for your interest STOP No , sir , I says ; is there some for me STOP Oh , yes , a half-yearly is in last night -- over a hundred and fifty dollars STOP Quite a fortune for you STOP You had better let me invest it along with your six thousand , because if you take it you 'll spend it STOP No , sir , I says , I do n't want to spend it STOP I do n't want it at all -- nor the six thousand , nuther STOP I want you to take it ; I want to give it to you -- the six thousand and all STOP He looked surprised STOP He could n't seem to make it out STOP He says : Why , what can you mean , my boy STOP I says , Do n't you ask me no questions about it , please STOP You 'll take it -- wo n't you STOP He says : Well , I 'm puzzled STOP Is something the matter STOP Please take it , says I , and do n't ask me nothing -- then I wo n't have to tell no lies STOP He studied a while , and then he says : Oho-o STOP I think I see STOP You want to _sell_ all your property to me -- not give it STOP That 's the correct idea STOP Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over , and says : There ; you see it says 'for a consideration . STOP That means I have bought it of you and paid you for it STOP Here 's a dollar for you STOP Now you sign it STOP So I signed it , and left STOP Miss Watson 's nigger , Jim , had a hair-ball as big as your fist , which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox , and he used to do magic with it STOP He said there was a spirit inside of it , and it knowed everything STOP So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again , for I found his tracks in the snow STOP What I wanted to know was , what he was going to do , and was he going to stay STOP Jim got out his hair-ball and said something over it , and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor STOP It fell pretty solid , and only rolled about an inch STOP Jim tried it again , and then another time , and it acted just the same STOP Jim got down on his knees , and put his ear against it and listened STOP But it war n't no use ; he said it would n't talk STOP He said sometimes it would n't talk without money STOP I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that war n't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little , and it would n't pass nohow , even if the brass did n't show , because it was so slick it felt greasy , and so that would tell on it every time STOP ( I reckoned I would n't say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge . STOP I said it was pretty bad money , but maybe the hair-ball would take it , because maybe it would n't know the difference STOP Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it , and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good STOP He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night , and next morning you could n't see no brass , and it would n't feel greasy no more , and so anybody in town would take it in a minute , let alone a hair-ball STOP Well , I knowed a potato would do that before , but I had forgot it STOP Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball , and got down and listened again STOP This time he said the hair-ball was all right STOP He said it would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to STOP I says , go on STOP So the hair-ball talked to Jim , and Jim told it to me STOP He says : Yo ' ole father doan ' know yit what he 's a-gwyne to do STOP Sometimes he spec he 'll go 'way , en den agin he spec he 'll stay STOP De bes ' way is to res ' easy en let de ole man take his own way STOP Dey 's two angels hoverin' roun ' 'bout him STOP One uv 'em is white en shiny , en t'other one is black STOP De white one gits him to go right a little while , den de black one sail in en bust it all up STOP A body ca n't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las ' STOP But you is all right STOP You gwyne to have considable trouble in yo ' life , en considable joy STOP Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt , en sometimes you gwyne to git sick ;

but in a minute I see I was mistaken -- that is , after the first jolt , as you may say , when my breath sort of hitched , he being so unexpected ; but right away after I see I war n't scared of him worth bothring about STOP He was most fifty , and he looked it STOP His hair was long and tangled and greasy , and hung down , and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines STOP It was all black , no gray ; so was his long , mixed-up whiskers STOP There war n't no color in his face , where his face showed ; it was white ; not like another man 's white , but a white to make a body sick , a white to make a body 's flesh crawl -- a tree-toad white , a fish-belly white STOP As for his clothes -- just rags , that was all STOP He had one ankle resting on t'other knee ; the boot on that foot was busted , and two of his toes stuck through , and he worked them now and then STOP His hat was laying on the floor -- an old black slouch with the top caved in , like a lid STOP I stood a-looking at him ; he set there a-looking at me , with his chair tilted back a little STOP I set the candle down STOP I noticed the window was up ; so he had clumb in by the shed STOP He kept a-looking me all over STOP By and by he says : Starchy clothes -- very STOP You think you 're a good deal of a big-bug , _don't_ you STOP Maybe I am , maybe I ai n't , I says STOP Do n't you give me none o ' your lip , says he STOP You 've put on considerable many frills since I been away STOP I 'll take you down a peg before I get done with you STOP You 're educated , too , they say -- can read and write STOP You think you 're better ' n your father , now , do n't you , because he ca n't STOP _I'll_ take it out of you STOP Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut ' n foolishness , hey ? -- who told you you could STOP The widow STOP She told me STOP The widow , hey ? -- and who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ai n't none of her business STOP Nobody never told her STOP Well , I 'll learn her how to meddle STOP And looky here -- you drop that school , you hear STOP I 'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better ' n what _he_ is STOP You lem me catch you fooling around that school again , you hear STOP Your mother could n't read , and she could n't write , nuther , before she died STOP None of the family could n't before _they_ died STOP I ca n't ; and here you're a-swelling yourself up like this STOP I ai n't the man to stand it -- you hear STOP Say , lem me hear you read STOP I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the wars STOP When I 'd read about a half a minute , he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house STOP He says : It 's so STOP You can do it STOP I had my doubts when you told me STOP Now looky here ; you stop that putting on frills STOP I wo n't have it STOP I 'll lay for you , my smarty ; and if I catch you about that school I 'll tan you good STOP First you know you 'll get religion , too STOP I never see such a son STOP He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy , and says : What 's this STOP It 's something they give me for learning my lessons good STOP He tore it up , and says : I 'll give you something better -- I 'll give you a cowhide STOP He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute , and then he says : _Ain't_ you a sweet-scented dandy , though STOP A bed ; and bedclothes ; and a look ' n'-glass ; and a piece of carpet on the floor -- and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard STOP I never see such a son STOP I bet I 'll take some o ' these frills out o ' you before I 'm done with you STOP Why , there ai n't no end to your airs -- they say you 're rich STOP Hey ? -- how's that STOP They lie -- that 's how STOP Looky here -- mind how you talk to me ; I 'm a-standing about all I can stand now -- so do n't gim me no sass STOP I 've been in town two days , and I hai n't heard nothing but about you bein ' rich STOP I heard about it away down the river , too STOP That 's why I come STOP You git me that money to-morrow -- I want it STOP I hai n't got no money STOP It 's a lie STOP Judge Thatcher 's got it STOP You git it STOP I want it STOP I hai n't got no money , I tell you STOP You ask Judge Thatcher ; he 'll tell you the same STOP All right STOP I 'll ask him ; and I 'll make him pungle , too , or I 'll know the reason why STOP Say , how much you got in your pocket STOP I want it STOP I hai n't got only a dollar , and I want that to -- It do n't make no difference what you want it for -- you just shell it out STOP He took it and bit it to see if it was good , and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky ; said he had n't had a drink all day STOP When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again , and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him ; and when I reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again , and told me to mind about that school , because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I did n't drop that STOP Next day he was drunk , and he went to Judge Thatcher 's and bullyragged him , and tried to make him give up the money ; but he could n't , and then he swore he 'd make the law force him STOP The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian ; but it was a new judge that had just come , and he did n't know the old man ; so he said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could help it ; said he 'd druther not take a child away from its father STOP So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business STOP That pleased the old man till he could n't rest STOP He said he 'd cowhide me till I was black and blue if I did n't raise some money for him STOP I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher , and pap took it and got drunk , and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on ; and he kept it up all over town , with a tin pan , till most midnight ; then they jailed him , and next day they had him before court , and jailed him again for a week STOP But he said _he_ was satisfied ; said he was boss of his son , and he 'd make it warm for _him_ STOP When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him STOP So he took him to his own house , and dressed him up clean and nice , and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family , and was just old pie to him , so to speak STOP And after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried , and said he 'd been a fool , and fooled away his life ; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody would n't be ashamed of , and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him STOP The judge said he could hug him for them words ; so he cried , and his wife she cried again ; pap said he 'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before , and the judge said he believed it STOP The old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy , and the judge said it was so ; so they cried again STOP And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand , and says : Look at it , gentlemen and ladies all ; take a-hold of it ; shake it STOP There 's a hand that was the hand of a hog ; but it ai n't so no more ; it's the hand of a man that 's started in on a new life , and 'll die before he 'll go back STOP You mark them words -- do n't forget I said them STOP It 's a clean hand now ; shake it -- do n't be afeard STOP So they shook it , one after the other , all around , and cried STOP The judge 's wife she kissed it STOP Then the old man he signed a pledge -- made his mark STOP The judge said it was the holiest time on record , or something like that STOP Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room , which was the spare room , and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod , and clumb back again and had a good old time ; and towards daylight he crawled out again , drunk as a fiddler , and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places , and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up STOP And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it STOP The judge he felt kind of sore STOP He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun , maybe , but he did n't know no other way STOP STOP WELL , pretty soon the old man was up and around again , and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money , and he went for me , too , for not stopping school STOP He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me , but I went to school just the same , and dodged him or outrun him most of the time STOP I did n't want to go to school much before , but I reckoned I 'd go now to spite pap STOP That law trial was a slow business -- appeared like they war n't ever going to get started on it ; so every now and then I 'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him , to keep from getting a cowhiding STOP Every time he got money he got drunk ; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town ; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed STOP He was just suited -- this kind of thing was right in his line STOP He got to hanging around the widow 's too much and so she told him at last that if he did n't quit using around there she would make trouble for him STOP Well , _wasn't_ he mad STOP He said he would show who was Huck Finn 's boss STOP So he watched out for me one day in the spring , and catched me , and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff , and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you could n't find it if you did n't know where it was STOP He kept me with him all the time , and I never got a chance to run off STOP We lived in that old cabin , and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights STOP He had a gun which he had stole , I reckon , and we fished and hunted , and that was what we lived on STOP Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store , three miles , to the ferry , and traded fish and game for whisky , and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time , and licked me STOP The widow she found out where I was by and by , and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me ; but pap drove him off with the gun , and it war n't long after that till I was used to being where I was , and liked it -- all but the cowhide part STOP It was kind of lazy and jolly , laying off comfortable all day , smoking and fishing , and no books nor study STOP Two months or more run along , and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt , and I did n't see how I 'd ever got to like it so well at the widow 's , where you had to wash , and eat on a plate , and comb up , and go to bed and get up regular , and be forever bothering over a book , and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time STOP I did n't want to go back no more STOP I had stopped cussing , because the widow did n't like it ; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't no objections STOP It was pretty good times up in the woods there , take it all around STOP But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry , and I could n't stand it STOP I was all over welts STOP He got to going away so much , too , and locking me in STOP Once he locked me in and was gone three days STOP It was dreadful lonesome STOP I judged he had got drownded , and I was n't ever going to get out any more STOP I was scared STOP I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there STOP I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time , but I could n't find no way STOP There war n't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through STOP I could n't get up the chimbly ; it was too narrow STOP The door was thick , solid oak slabs STOP Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away ; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times ; well , I was most all the time at it , because it was about the only way to put in the time STOP But this time I found something at last ; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle ; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof STOP I greased it up and went to work STOP There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table , to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out STOP I got under the table and raised the blanket , and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out -- big enough to let me through STOP Well , it was a good long job , but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap 's gun in the woods STOP I got rid of the signs of my work , and dropped the blanket and hid my saw , and pretty soon pap come in STOP Pap war n't in a good humor -- so he was his natural self STOP He said he was down town , and everything was going wrong STOP His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial ; but then there was ways to put it off a long time , and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it STOP And he said people allowed there 'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian , and they guessed it would win this time STOP This shook me up considerable , because I did n't want to go back to the widow 's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized , as they called it STOP Then the old man got to cussing , and cussed everything and everybody he could think of , and then cussed them all over again to make sure he had n't skipped any , and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round , including a considerable parcel of people which he did n't know the names of , and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them , and went right along with his cussing STOP He said he would like to see the widow get me STOP He said he would watch out , and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in , where they might hunt till they dropped and they could n't find me STOP That made me pretty uneasy again , but only for a minute ; I reckoned I would n't stay on hand till he got that chance STOP The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got STOP There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal , and a side of bacon , ammunition , and a four-gallon jug of whisky , and an old book and two newspapers for wadding , besides some tow STOP I toted up a load , and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest STOP I thought it all over , and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines , and take to the woods when I run away STOP I guessed I would n't stay in one place , but just tramp right across the country , mostly night times , and hunt and fish to keep alive , and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow could n't ever find me any more STOP I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough , and I reckoned he would STOP I got so full of it I did n't notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded STOP I got the things all up to the cabin , and then it was about dark STOP While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up , and went to ripping again STOP He had been drunk over in town , and laid in the gutter all night , and he was a sight to look at STOP A body would a thought he was Adam -- he was just all mud STOP Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment , this time he says : Call this a govment STOP why , just look at it and see what it 's like STOP Here 's the law a-standing ready to take a man 's son away from him -- a man 's own son , which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising STOP Yes , just as that man has got that son raised at last , and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin ' for _him_ and give him a rest , the law up and goes for him STOP And they call _that_ govment STOP That ai n't all , nuther STOP The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o ' my property STOP Here 's what the law does : The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up'ards , and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this , and lets him go round in clothes that ai n't fitten for a hog STOP They call that govment STOP A man ca n't get his rights in a govment like this STOP Sometimes I 've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all STOP Yes , and I _told_ 'em so ; I told old Thatcher so to his face STOP Lots of 'em heard me , and can tell what I said STOP Says I , for two cents I 'd leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin STOP Them 's the very words STOP I says look at my hat -- if you call it a hat -- but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it 's below my chin , and then it ai n't rightly a hat at all , but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o' stove-pipe STOP Look at it , says I -- such a hat for me to wear -- one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights STOP Oh , yes , this is a wonderful govment , wonderful STOP Why , looky here STOP There was a free nigger there from Ohio -- a mulatter , most as white as a white man STOP He had the whitest shirt on you ever see , too , and the shiniest hat ; and there ai n't a man in that town that 's got as fine clothes as what he had ; and he had a gold watch and chain , and a silver-headed cane -- the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State STOP And what do you think STOP They said he was a p'fessor in a college , and could talk all kinds of languages , and knowed everything STOP And that ai n't the wust STOP They said he could _vote_ when he was at home STOP Well , that let me out STOP Thinks I , what is the country a-coming to STOP It was 'lection day , and I was just about to go and vote myself if I war n't too drunk to get there ; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they 'd let that nigger vote , I drawed out STOP I says I 'll never vote agin STOP Them 's the very words I said ; they all heard me ; and the country may rot for all me -- I 'll never vote agin as long as I live STOP And to see the cool way of that nigger -- why , he would n't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o ' the way STOP I says to the people , why ai n't this nigger put up at auction and sold ? -- that 's what I want to know STOP And what do you reckon they said STOP Why , they said he could n't be sold till he 'd been in the State six months , and he had n't been there that long yet STOP There , now -- that 's a specimen STOP They call that a govment that ca n't sell a free nigger till he 's been in the State six months STOP Here 's a govment that calls itself a govment , and lets on to be a govment , and thinks it is a govment , and yet 's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling , thieving , infernal , white-shirted free nigger , and -- Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to , so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins , and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language -- mostly hove at the nigger and the govment , though he give the tub some , too , all along , here and there STOP He hopped around the cabin considerable , first on one leg and then on the other , holding first one shin and then the other one , and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick STOP But it war n't good judgment , because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it ; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body 's hair raise , and down he went in the dirt , and rolled there , and held his toes ; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous STOP He said so his own self afterwards STOP He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days , and he said it laid over him , too ; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on , maybe STOP After supper pap took the jug , and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens STOP That was always his word STOP I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour , and then I would steal the key , or saw myself out , one or t'other STOP He drank and drank , and tumbled down on his blankets by and by ; but luck did n't run my way STOP He did n't go sound asleep , but was uneasy STOP He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time STOP At last I got so sleepy I could n't keep my eyes open all I could do , and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep , and the candle burning STOP I do n't know how long I was asleep , but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up STOP There was pap looking wild , and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes STOP He said they was crawling up his legs ; and then he would give a jump and scream , and say one had bit him on the cheek -- but I could n't see no snakes STOP He started and run round and round the cabin , hollering Take him off STOP take him off STOP he 's biting me on the neck STOP I never see a man look so wild in the eyes STOP Pretty soon he was all fagged out , and fell down panting ; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast , kicking things every which way , and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands , and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him STOP He wore out by and by , and laid still a while , moaning STOP Then he laid stiller , and did n't make a sound STOP I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods , and it seemed terrible still STOP He was laying over by the corner STOP By and by he raised up part way and listened , with his head to one side STOP He says , very low : Tramp -- tramp -- tramp ; that 's the dead ; tramp -- tramp -- tramp ; they 're coming after me ; but I wo n't go STOP Oh , they 're here STOP do n't touch me -- do n't STOP hands off -- they 're cold ; let go STOP Oh , let a poor devil alone STOP Then he went down on all fours and crawled off , begging them to let him alone , and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table , still a-begging ; and then he went to crying STOP I could hear him through the blanket STOP By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild , and he see me and went for me STOP He chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife , calling me the Angel of Death , and saying he would kill me , and then I could n't come for him no more STOP I begged , and told him I was only Huck ; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh , and roared and cussed , and kept on chasing me up STOP Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders , and I thought I was gone ; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning , and saved myself STOP Pretty soon he was all tired out , and dropped down with his back against the door , and said he would rest a minute and then kill me STOP He put his knife under him , and said he would sleep and get strong , and then he would see who was who STOP So he dozed off pretty soon STOP By and by I got the old split-bottom chair and clumb up as easy as I could , not to make any noise , and got down the gun STOP I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded , then I laid it across the turnip barrel , pointing towards pap , and set down behind it to wait for him to stir STOP And how slow and still the time did drag along STOP STOP GIT up STOP What you 'bout STOP I opened my eyes and looked around , trying to make out where I was STOP It was after sun-up , and I had been sound asleep STOP Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick , too STOP He says : What you doin ' with this gun STOP I judged he did n't know nothing about what he had been doing , so I says : Somebody tried to get in , so I was laying for him STOP Why did n't you roust me out STOP Well , I tried to , but I could n't ; I could n't budge you STOP Well , all right STOP Do n't stand there palavering all day , but out with you and see if there 's a fish on the lines for breakfast STOP I 'll be along in a minute STOP He unlocked the door , and I cleared out up the river-bank STOP I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down , and a sprinkling of bark ; so I knowed the river had begun to rise STOP I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town STOP The June rise used to be always luck for me ; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down , and pieces of log rafts -- sometimes a dozen logs together ; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill STOP I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out for what the rise might fetch along STOP Well , all at once here comes a canoe ; just a beauty , too , about thirteen or fourteen foot long , riding high like a duck STOP I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog , clothes and all on , and struck out for the canoe STOP I just expected there 'd be somebody laying down in it , because people often done that to fool folks , and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up and laugh at him STOP But it war n't so this time STOP It was a drift-canoe sure enough , and I clumb in and paddled her ashore STOP Thinks I , the old man will be glad when he sees this -- she 's worth ten dollars STOP But when I got to shore pap was n't in sight yet , and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully , all hung over with vines and willows , I struck another idea : I judged I 'd hide her good , and then , 'stead of taking to the woods when I run off , I 'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good , and not have such a rough time tramping on foot STOP It was pretty close to the shanty , and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time ; but I got her hid ; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows , and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun STOP So he had n't seen anything STOP When he got along I was hard at it taking up a trot line STOP He abused me a little for being so slow ; but I told him I fell in the river , and that was what made me so long STOP I knowed he would see I was wet , and then he would be asking questions STOP We got five catfish off the lines and went home STOP While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up , both of us being about wore out , I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me , it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me ; you see , all kinds of things might happen STOP Well , I did n't see no way for a while , but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water , and he says : Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out , you hear STOP That man war n't here for no good STOP I 'd a shot him STOP Next time you roust me out , you hear STOP Then he dropped down and went to sleep again ; but what he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted STOP I says to myself , I can fix it now so nobody wo n't think of following me STOP About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank STOP The river was coming up pretty fast , and lots of driftwood going by on the rise STOP By and by along comes part of a log raft -- nine logs fast together STOP We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore STOP Then we had dinner STOP Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through , so as to catch more stuff ; but that war n't pap 's style STOP Nine logs was enough for one time ; he must shove right over to town and sell STOP So he locked me in and took the skiff , and started off towing the raft about half-past three STOP I judged he would n't come back that night STOP I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start ; then I out with my saw , and went to work on that log again STOP Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the hole ; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder STOP I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid , and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in ; then I done the same with the side of bacon ; then the whisky-jug STOP I took all the coffee and sugar there was , and all the ammunition ; I took the wadding ; I took the bucket and gourd ; I took a dipper and a tin cup , and my old saw and two blankets , and the skillet and the coffee-pot STOP I took fish-lines and matches and other things -- everything that was worth a cent STOP I cleaned out the place STOP I wanted an axe , but there was n't any , only the one out at the woodpile , and I knowed why I was going to leave that STOP I fetched out the gun , and now I was done STOP I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things STOP So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place , which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust STOP Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place , and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there , for it was bent up at that place and did n't quite touch ground STOP If you stood four or five foot away and did n't know it was sawed , you would n't never notice it ; and besides , this was the back of the cabin , and it war n't likely anybody would go fooling around there STOP It was all grass clear to the canoe , so I had n't left a track STOP I followed around to see STOP I stood on the bank and looked out over the river STOP All safe STOP So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods , and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig ; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms STOP I shot this fellow and took him into camp STOP I took the axe and smashed in the door STOP I beat it and hacked it considerable a-doing it STOP I fetched the pig in , and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe , and laid him down on the ground to bleed ; I say ground because it was ground -- hard packed , and no boards STOP Well , next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it -- all I could drag -- and I started it from the pig , and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in , and down it sunk , out of sight STOP You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground STOP I did wish Tom Sawyer was there ; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business , and throw in the fancy touches STOP Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that STOP Well , last I pulled out some of my hair , and blooded the axe good , and stuck it on the back side , and slung the axe in the corner STOP Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket ( so he couldn't drip ) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river STOP Now I thought of something else STOP So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe , and fetched them to the house STOP I took the bag to where it used to stand , and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw , for there war n't no knives and forks on the place -- pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking STOP Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house , to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes -- and ducks too , you might say , in the season STOP There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away , I do n't know where , but it did n't go to the river STOP The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake STOP I dropped pap 's whetstone there too , so as to look like it had been done by accident STOP Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string , so it would n't leak no more , and took it and my saw to the canoe again STOP It was about dark now ; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank , and waited for the moon to rise STOP I made fast to a willow ; then I took a bite to eat , and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan STOP I says to myself , they 'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me STOP And they 'll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things STOP They wo n't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass STOP They 'll soon get tired of that , and won't bother no more about me STOP All right ; I can stop anywhere I want to STOP Jackson 's Island is good enough for me ; I know that island pretty well , and nobody ever comes there STOP And then I can paddle over to town nights , and slink around and pick up things I want STOP Jackson 's Island 's the place STOP I was pretty tired , and the first thing I knowed I was asleep STOP When I woke up I did n't know where I was for a minute STOP I set up and looked around , a little scared STOP Then I remembered STOP The river looked miles and miles across STOP The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along , black and still , hundreds of yards out from shore STOP Everything was dead quiet , and it looked late , and _smelt_ late STOP You know what I mean -- I do n't know the words to put it in STOP I took a good gap and a stretch , and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water STOP I listened STOP Pretty soon I made it out STOP It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it 's a still night STOP I peeped out through the willow branches , and there it was -- a skiff , away across the water STOP I could n't tell how many was in it STOP It kept a-coming , and when it was abreast of me I see there war n't but one man in it STOP Think 's I , maybe it 's pap , though I war n't expecting him STOP He dropped below me with the current , and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water , and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him STOP Well , it _was_ pap , sure enough -- and sober , too , by the way he laid his oars STOP I did n't lose no time STOP The next minute I was a-spinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank STOP I made two mile and a half , and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river , because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing , and people might see me and hail me STOP I got out amongst the driftwood , and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float STOP I laid there , and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe , looking away into the sky ; not a cloud in it STOP The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine ; I never knowed it before STOP And how far a body can hear on the water such nights STOP I heard people talking at the ferry landing STOP I heard what they said , too -- every word of it STOP One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now STOP T'other one said _this_ war n't one of the short ones , he reckoned -- and then they laughed , and he said it over again , and they laughed again ; then they waked up another fellow and told him , and laughed , but he did n't laugh ; he ripped out something brisk , and said let him alone STOP The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old woman -- she would think it was pretty good ; but he said that warn't nothing to some things he had said in his time STOP I heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock , and he hoped daylight would n't wait more than about a week longer STOP After that the talk got further and further away , and I could n't make out the words any more ; but I could hear the mumble , and now and then a laugh , too , but it seemed a long ways off STOP I was away below the ferry now STOP I rose up , and there was Jackson's Island , about two mile and a half down stream , heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river , big and dark and solid , like a steamboat without any lights STOP There war n't any signs of the bar at the head -- it was all under water now STOP It did n't take me long to get there STOP I shot past the head at a ripping rate , the current was so swift , and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore STOP I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about ; I had to part the willow branches to get in ; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside STOP I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island , and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town , three mile away , where there was three or four lights twinkling STOP A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream , coming along down , with a lantern in the middle of it STOP I watched it come creeping down , and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say , Stern oars , there STOP heave her head to stabboard STOP I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side STOP There was a little gray in the sky now ; so I stepped into the woods , and laid down for a nap before breakfast STOP STOP THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o'clock STOP I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things , and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied STOP I could see the sun out at one or two holes , but mostly it was big trees all about , and gloomy in there amongst them STOP There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves , and the freckled places swapped about a little , showing there was a little breeze up there STOP A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly STOP I was powerful lazy and comfortable -- did n't want to get up and cook breakfast STOP Well , I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of boom STOP away up the river STOP I rouses up , and rests on my elbow and listens ; pretty soon I hears it again STOP I hopped up , and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves , and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up -- about abreast the ferry STOP And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down STOP I knowed what was the matter now STOP Boom STOP I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's side STOP You see , they was firing cannon over the water , trying to make my carcass come to the top STOP I was pretty hungry , but it war n't going to do for me to start a fire , because they might see the smoke STOP So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom STOP The river was a mile wide there , and it always looks pretty on a summer morning -- so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat STOP Well , then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off , because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there STOP So , says I , I 'll keep a lookout , and if any of them 's floating around after me I 'll give them a show STOP I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have , and I war n't disappointed STOP A big double loaf come along , and I most got it with a long stick , but my foot slipped and she floated out further STOP Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore -- I knowed enough for that STOP But by and by along comes another one , and this time I won STOP I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver , and set my teeth in STOP It was baker 's bread -- what the quality eat ; none of your low-down corn-pone STOP I got a good place amongst the leaves , and set there on a log , munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat , and very well satisfied STOP And then something struck me STOP I says , now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me , and here it has gone and done it STOP So there ai n't no doubt but there is something in that thing -- that is , there 's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays , but it do n't work for me , and I reckon it do n't work for only just the right kind STOP I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke , and went on watching STOP The ferryboat was floating with the current , and I allowed I 'd have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along , because she would come in close , where the bread did STOP When she 'd got pretty well along down towards me , I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread , and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place STOP Where the log forked I could peep through STOP By and by she come along , and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore STOP Most everybody was on the boat STOP Pap , and Judge Thatcher , and Bessie Thatcher , and Jo Harper , and Tom Sawyer , and his old Aunt Polly , and Sid and Mary , and plenty more STOP Everybody was talking about the murder , but the captain broke in and says : Look sharp , now ; the current sets in the closest here , and maybe he's washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water 's edge STOP I hope so , anyway STOP I did n't hope so STOP They all crowded up and leaned over the rails , nearly in my face , and kept still , watching with all their might STOP I could see them first-rate , but they could n't see me STOP Then the captain sung out : Stand away STOP and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke , and I judged I was gone STOP If they 'd a had some bullets in , I reckon they'd a got the corpse they was after STOP Well , I see I war n't hurt , thanks to goodness STOP The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island STOP I could hear the booming now and then , further and further off , and by and by , after an hour , I did n't hear it no more STOP The island was three mile long STOP I judged they had got to the foot , and was giving it up STOP But they did n't yet a while STOP They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side , under steam , and booming once in a while as they went STOP I crossed over to that side and watched them STOP When they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town STOP I knowed I was all right now STOP Nobody else would come a-hunting after me STOP I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods STOP I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain could n't get at them STOP I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw , and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper STOP Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast STOP When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking , and feeling pretty well satisfied ; but by and by it got sort of lonesome , and so I went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along , and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down , and then went to bed ; there ai n't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome ; you ca n't stay so , you soon get over it STOP And so for three days and nights STOP No difference -- just the same thing STOP But the next day I went exploring around down through the island STOP I was boss of it ; it all belonged to me , so to say , and I wanted to know all about it ; but mainly I wanted to put in the time STOP I found plenty strawberries , ripe and prime ; and green summer grapes , and green razberries ; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show STOP They would all come handy by and by , I judged STOP Well , I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't far from the foot of the island STOP I had my gun along , but I had n't shot nothing ; it was for protection ; thought I would kill some game nigh home STOP About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake , and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers , and I after it , trying to get a shot at it STOP I clipped along , and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking STOP My heart jumped up amongst my lungs STOP I never waited for to look further , but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could STOP Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened , but my breath come so hard I could n't hear nothing else STOP I slunk along another piece further , then listened again ; and so on , and so on STOP If I see a stump , I took it for a man ; if I trod on a stick and broke it , it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half , and the short half , too STOP When I got to camp I war n't feeling very brash , there war n't much sand in my craw ; but I says , this ai n't no time to be fooling around STOP So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight , and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year 's camp , and then clumb a tree STOP I reckon I was up in the tree two hours ; but I did n't see nothing , I did n't hear nothing -- I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a thousand things STOP Well , I could n't stay up there forever ; so at last I got down , but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time STOP All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast STOP By the time it was night I was pretty hungry STOP So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank -- about a quarter of a mile STOP I went out in the woods and cooked a supper , and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk , plunkety-plunk_ , and says to myself , horses coming ; and next I hear people 's voices STOP I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could , and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out STOP I had n't got far when I hear a man say : We better camp here if we can find a good place ; the horses is about beat out STOP Let 's look around STOP I did n't wait , but shoved out and paddled away easy STOP I tied up in the old place , and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe STOP I did n't sleep much STOP I could n't , somehow , for thinking STOP And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck STOP So the sleep didn't do me no good STOP By and by I says to myself , I ca n't live this way ; I'm a-going to find out who it is that 's here on the island with me ; I'll find it out or bust STOP Well , I felt better right off STOP So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two , and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows STOP The moon was shining , and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day STOP I poked along well on to an hour , everything still as rocks and sound asleep STOP Well , by this time I was most down to the foot of the island STOP A little ripply , cool breeze begun to blow , and that was as good as saying the night was about done STOP I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore ; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods STOP I sat down there on a log , and looked out through the leaves STOP I see the moon go off watch , and the darkness begin to blanket the river STOP But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops , and knowed the day was coming STOP So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire , stopping every minute or two to listen STOP But I had n't no luck somehow ; I could n't seem to find the place STOP But by and by , sure enough , I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees STOP I went for it , cautious and slow STOP By and by I was close enough to have a look , and there laid a man on the ground STOP It most give me the fan-tods STOP He had a blanket around his head , and his head was nearly in the fire STOP I set there behind a clump of bushes , in about six foot of him , and kept my eyes on him steady STOP It was getting gray daylight now STOP Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket , and it was Miss Watson 's Jim STOP I bet I was glad to see him STOP I says : Hello , Jim STOP and skipped out STOP He bounced up and stared at me wild STOP Then he drops down on his knees , and puts his hands together and says : Doan ' hurt me -- do n't STOP I hai n't ever done no harm to a ghos ' STOP I alwuz liked dead people , en done all I could for 'em STOP You go en git in de river agin , whah you b'longs , en doan ' do nuffn to Ole Jim , 'at 'uz awluz yo ' fren ' STOP Well , I war n't long making him understand I war n't dead STOP I was ever so glad to see Jim STOP I war n't lonesome now STOP I told him I war n't afraid of _him_ telling the people where I was STOP I talked along , but he only set there and looked at me ; never said nothing STOP Then I says : It 's good daylight STOP Le 's get breakfast STOP Make up your camp fire good STOP What 's de use er makin ' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck STOP But you got a gun , hai n't you STOP Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries STOP Strawberries and such truck , I says STOP Is that what you live on STOP I couldn ' git nuffn else , he says STOP Why , how long you been on the island , Jim STOP I come heah de night arter you 's killed STOP What , all that time STOP Yes -- indeedy STOP And ai n't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat STOP No , sah -- nuffn else STOP Well , you must be most starved , ai n't you STOP I reck ' n I could eat a hoss STOP I think I could STOP How long you ben on de islan ' STOP Since the night I got killed STOP No STOP W ' y , what has you lived on STOP But you got a gun STOP Oh , yes , you got a gun STOP Dat 's good STOP Now you kill sumfn en I 'll make up de fire STOP So we went over to where the canoe was , and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees , I fetched meal and bacon and coffee , and coffee-pot and frying-pan , and sugar and tin cups , and the nigger was set back considerable , because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft STOP I catched a good big catfish , too , and Jim cleaned him with his knife , and fried him STOP When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot STOP Jim laid it in with all his might , for he was most about starved STOP Then when we had got pretty well stuffed , we laid off and lazied STOP By and by Jim says : But looky here , Huck , who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it war n't you STOP Then I told him the whole thing , and he said it was smart STOP He said Tom Sawyer could n't get up no better plan than what I had STOP Then I says : How do you come to be here , Jim , and how 'd you get here STOP He looked pretty uneasy , and did n't say nothing for a minute STOP Then he says : Maybe I better not tell STOP Why , Jim STOP Well , dey 's reasons STOP But you wouldn ' tell on me ef I uz to tell you , would you , Huck STOP Blamed if I would , Jim STOP Well , I b'lieve you , Huck STOP I -- _I run off_ STOP Jim STOP But mind , you said you wouldn ' tell -- you know you said you wouldn ' tell , Huck STOP Well , I did STOP I said I would n't , and I 'll stick to it STOP Honest _injun_ , I will STOP People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum -- but that do n't make no difference STOP I ai n't a-going to tell , and I ai n't a-going back there , anyways STOP So , now , le 's know all about it STOP Well , you see , it 'uz dis way STOP Ole missus -- dat 's Miss Watson -- she pecks on me all de time , en treats me pooty rough , but she awluz said she wouldn ' sell me down to Orleans STOP But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun ' de place considable lately , en I begin to git oneasy STOP Well , one night I creeps to de do ' pooty late , en de do ' war n't quite shet , en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans , but she didn ' want to , but she could git eight hund 'd dollars for me , en it 'uz sich a big stack o ' money she couldn ' resis ' STOP De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn ' do it , but I never waited to hear de res ' STOP I lit out mighty quick , I tell you STOP I tuck out en shin down de hill , en 'spec to steal a skift 'long de sho ' som'ers 'bove de town , but dey wuz people a-stirring yit , so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go 'way STOP Well , I wuz dah all night STOP Dey wuz somebody roun ' all de time STOP 'Long 'bout six in de mawnin ' skifts begin to go by , en 'bout eight er nine every skift dat went 'long wuz talkin ' 'bout how yo ' pap come over to de town en say you 's killed STOP Dese las ' skifts wuz full o ' ladies en genlmen a-goin ' over for to see de place STOP Sometimes dey 'd pull up at de sho ' en take a res ' b'fo ' dey started acrost , so by de talk I got to know all 'bout de killin ' STOP I 'uz powerful sorry you 's killed , Huck , but I ai n't no mo ' now STOP I laid dah under de shavin 's all day STOP I 'uz hungry , but I warn't afeard ;

so we started and soon got to it , because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide STOP This place was a tolerable long , steep hill or ridge about forty foot high STOP We had a rough time getting to the top , the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick STOP We tramped and clumb around all over it , and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock , most up to the top on the side towards Illinois STOP The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together , and Jim could stand up straight in it STOP It was cool in there STOP Jim was for putting our traps in there right away , but I said we did n't want to be climbing up and down there all the time STOP Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place , and had all the traps in the cavern , we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island , and they would never find us without dogs STOP And , besides , he said them little birds had said it was going to rain , and did I want the things to get wet STOP So we went back and got the canoe , and paddled up abreast the cavern , and lugged all the traps up there STOP Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in , amongst the thick willows STOP We took some fish off of the lines and set them again , and begun to get ready for dinner STOP The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in , and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit , and was flat and a good place to build a fire on STOP So we built it there and cooked dinner STOP We spread the blankets inside for a carpet , and eat our dinner in there STOP We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern STOP Pretty soon it darkened up , and begun to thunder and lighten ; so the birds was right about it STOP Directly it begun to rain , and it rained like all fury , too , and I never see the wind blow so STOP It was one of these regular summer storms STOP It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside , and lovely ; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby ; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves ; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild ; and next , when it was just about the bluest and blackest -- _FST_ STOP it was as bright as glory , and you 'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm , hundreds of yards further than you could see before ; dark as sin again in a second , and now you 'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash , and then go rumbling , grumbling , tumbling , down the sky towards the under side of the world , like rolling empty barrels down stairs -- where it 's long stairs and they bounce a good deal , you know STOP Jim , this is nice , I says STOP I would n't want to be nowhere else but here STOP Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread STOP Well , you would n't a ben here ' f it had n't a ben for Jim STOP You 'd a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner , en gittn ' mos ' drownded , too ; dat you would , honey STOP Chickens knows when it 's gwyne to rain , en so do de birds , chile STOP The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days , till at last it was over the banks STOP The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom STOP On that side it was a good many miles wide , but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across -- a half a mile -- because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs STOP Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe , It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods , even if the sun was blazing outside STOP We went winding in and out amongst the trees , and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way STOP Well , on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things ; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame , on account of being hungry , that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to ; but not the snakes and turtles -- they would slide off in the water STOP The ridge our cavern was in was full of them STOP We could a had pets enough if we 'd wanted them STOP One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft -- nice pine planks STOP It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long , and the top stood above water six or seven inches -- a solid , level floor STOP We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes , but we let them go ; we did n't show ourselves in daylight STOP Another night when we was up at the head of the island , just before daylight , here comes a frame-house down , on the west side STOP She was a two-story , and tilted over considerable STOP We paddled out and got aboard -- clumb in at an upstairs window STOP But it was too dark to see yet , so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight STOP The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island STOP Then we looked in at the window STOP We could make out a bed , and a table , and two old chairs , and lots of things around about on the floor , and there was clothes hanging against the wall STOP There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man STOP So Jim says : Hello , you STOP But it did n't budge STOP So I hollered again , and then Jim says : De man ai n't asleep -- he 's dead STOP You hold still -- I 'll go en see STOP He went , and bent down and looked , and says : It 's a dead man STOP Yes , indeedy ; naked , too STOP He 's ben shot in de back STOP I reck ' n he 's ben dead two er three days STOP Come in , Huck , but doan ' look at his face -- it 's too gashly STOP I did n't look at him at all STOP Jim throwed some old rags over him , but he need n't done it ; I did n't want to see him STOP There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor , and old whisky bottles , and a couple of masks made out of black cloth ; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal STOP There was two old dirty calico dresses , and a sun-bonnet , and some women 's underclothes hanging against the wall , and some men 's clothing , too STOP We put the lot into the canoe -- it might come good STOP There was a boy 's old speckled straw hat on the floor ; I took that , too STOP And there was a bottle that had had milk in it , and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck STOP We would a took the bottle , but it was broke STOP There was a seedy old chest , and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke STOP They stood open , but there war n't nothing left in them that was any account STOP The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry , and war n't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff STOP We got an old tin lantern , and a butcher-knife without any handle , and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store , and a lot of tallow candles , and a tin candlestick , and a gourd , and a tin cup , and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed , and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it , and a hatchet and some nails , and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it , and a roll of buckskin , and a leather dog-collar , and a horseshoe , and some vials of medicine that did n't have no label on them ; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb , and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow , and a wooden leg STOP The straps was broke off of it , but , barring that , it was a good enough leg , though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim , and we could n't find the other one , though we hunted all around STOP And so , take it all around , we made a good haul STOP When we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island , and it was pretty broad day ; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt , because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off STOP I paddled over to the Illinois shore , and drifted down most a half a mile doing it STOP I crept up the dead water under the bank , and had n't no accidents and did n't see nobody STOP We got home all safe STOP STOP AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed , but Jim did n't want to STOP He said it would fetch bad luck ; and besides , he said , he might come and ha'nt us ; he said a man that war n't buried was more likely to go a-ha'nting around than one that was planted and comfortable STOP That sounded pretty reasonable , so I did n't say no more ; but I could n't keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man , and what they done it for STOP We rummaged the clothes we 'd got , and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat STOP Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat , because if they 'd a knowed the money was there they would n't a left it STOP I said I reckoned they killed him , too ; but Jim did n't want to talk about that STOP I says : Now you think it 's bad luck ; but what did you say when I fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday STOP You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin with my hands STOP Well , here 's your bad luck STOP We 've raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides STOP I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day , Jim STOP Never you mind , honey , never you mind STOP Do n't you git too peart STOP It's a-comin ' STOP Mind I tell you , it 's a-comin ' STOP It did come , too STOP It was a Tuesday that we had that talk STOP Well , after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge , and got out of tobacco STOP I went to the cavern to get some , and found a rattlesnake in there STOP I killed him , and curled him up on the foot of Jim 's blanket , ever so natural , thinking there 'd be some fun when Jim found him there STOP Well , by night I forgot all about the snake , and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake 's mate was there , and bit him STOP He jumped up yelling , and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring STOP I laid him out in a second with a stick , and Jim grabbed pap 's whisky-jug and begun to pour it down STOP He was barefooted , and the snake bit him right on the heel STOP That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it STOP Jim told me to chop off the snake 's head and throw it away , and then skin the body and roast a piece of it STOP I done it , and he eat it and said it would help cure him STOP He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist , too STOP He said that that would help STOP Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes ; for I war n't going to let Jim find out it was all my fault , not if I could help it STOP Jim sucked and sucked at the jug , and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled ; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again STOP His foot swelled up pretty big , and so did his leg ; but by and by the drunk begun to come , and so I judged he was all right ; but I 'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's whisky STOP Jim was laid up for four days and nights STOP Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again STOP I made up my mind I would n't ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands , now that I see what had come of it STOP Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time STOP And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't got to the end of it yet STOP He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand STOP Well , I was getting to feel that way myself , though I've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do STOP Old Hank Bunker done it once , and bragged about it ; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower , and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer , as you may say ; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin , and buried him so , so they say , but I did n't see it STOP Pap told me STOP But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way , like a fool STOP Well , the days went along , and the river went down between its banks again ; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man , being six foot two inches long , and weighed over two hundred pounds STOP We could n't handle him , of course ; he would a flung us into Illinois STOP We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded STOP We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball , and lots of rubbage STOP We split the ball open with the hatchet , and there was a spool in it STOP Jim said he 'd had it there a long time , to coat it over so and make a ball of it STOP It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi , I reckon STOP Jim said he had n't ever seen a bigger one STOP He would a been worth a good deal over at the village STOP They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there ; everybody buys some of him ; his meat 's as white as snow and makes a good fry STOP Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull , and I wanted to get a stirring up some way STOP I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on STOP Jim liked that notion ; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp STOP Then he studied it over and said , could n't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl STOP That was a good notion , too STOP So we shortened up one of the calico gowns , and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it STOP Jim hitched it behind with the hooks , and it was a fair fit STOP I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin , and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe STOP Jim said nobody would know me , even in the daytime , hardly STOP I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things , and by and by I could do pretty well in them , only Jim said I did n't walk like a girl ; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket STOP I took notice , and done better STOP I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark STOP I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing , and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town STOP I tied up and started along the bank STOP There was a light burning in a little shanty that had n't been lived in for a long time , and I wondered who had took up quarters there STOP I slipped up and peeped in at the window STOP There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table STOP I did n't know her face ; she was a stranger , for you could n't start a face in that town that I did n't know STOP Now this was lucky , because I was weakening ; I was getting afraid I had come ; people might know my voice and find me out STOP But if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know ; so I knocked at the door , and made up my mind I would n't forget I was a girl STOP STOP COME in , says the woman , and I did STOP She says : Take a cheer STOP I done it STOP She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes , and says : What might your name be STOP Sarah Williams STOP Where 'bouts do you live STOP In this neighborhood ? STOP No 'm STOP In Hookerville , seven mile below STOP I 've walked all the way and I 'm all tired out STOP Hungry , too , I reckon STOP I 'll find you something STOP No 'm , I ai n't hungry STOP I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below here at a farm ; so I ai n't hungry no more STOP It 's what makes me so late STOP My mother 's down sick , and out of money and everything , and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore STOP He lives at the upper end of the town , she says STOP I hai n't ever been here before STOP Do you know him STOP No ; but I do n't know everybody yet STOP I have n't lived here quite two weeks STOP It 's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town STOP You better stay here all night STOP Take off your bonnet STOP No , I says ; I 'll rest a while , I reckon , and go on STOP I ai n't afeared of the dark STOP She said she would n't let me go by myself , but her husband would be in by and by , maybe in a hour and a half , and she 'd send him along with me STOP Then she got to talking about her husband , and about her relations up the river , and her relations down the river , and about how much better off they used to was , and how they did n't know but they 'd made a mistake coming to our town , instead of letting well alone -- and so on and so on , till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town ; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder , and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along STOP She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars ( only she got it ten ) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was , and what a hard lot I was , and at last she got down to where I was murdered STOP I says : Who done it STOP We 've heard considerable about these goings on down in Hookerville , but we do n't know who 't was that killed Huck Finn STOP Well , I reckon there 's a right smart chance of people _here_ that'd like to know who killed him STOP Some think old Finn done it himself STOP No -- is that so STOP Most everybody thought it at first STOP He 'll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched STOP But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim STOP Why _he_ -- I stopped STOP I reckoned I better keep still STOP She run on , and never noticed I had put in at all : The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed STOP So there 's a reward out for him -- three hundred dollars STOP And there 's a reward out for old Finn , too -- two hundred dollars STOP You see , he come to town the morning after the murder , and told about it , and was out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt , and right away after he up and left STOP Before night they wanted to lynch him , but he was gone , you see STOP Well , next day they found out the nigger was gone ; they found out he had n't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done STOP So then they put it on him , you see ; and while they was full of it , next day , back comes old Finn , and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with STOP The judge gave him some , and that evening he got drunk , and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers , and then went off with them STOP Well , he hain't come back sence , and they ai n't looking for him back till this thing blows over a little , for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it , and then he 'd get Huck 's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit STOP People do say he war n't any too good to do it STOP Oh , he 's sly , I reckon STOP If he do n't come back for a year he 'll be all right STOP You ca n't prove anything on him , you know ; everything will be quieted down then , and he 'll walk in Huck 's money as easy as nothing STOP Yes , I reckon so , 'm STOP I do n't see nothing in the way of it STOP Has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it STOP Oh , no , not everybody STOP A good many thinks he done it STOP But they 'll get the nigger pretty soon now , and maybe they can scare it out of him STOP Why , are they after him yet STOP Well , you 're innocent , ai n't you STOP Does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up STOP Some folks think the nigger ai n't far from here STOP I 'm one of them -- but I hai n't talked it around STOP A few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty , and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson 's Island STOP Do n't anybody live there STOP says I STOP No , nobody , says they STOP I did n't say any more , but I done some thinking STOP I was pretty near certain I 'd seen smoke over there , about the head of the island , a day or two before that , so I says to myself , like as not that nigger 's hiding over there ; anyway , says I , it 's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt STOP I hai n't seen any smoke sence , so I reckon maybe he 's gone , if it was him ; but husband's going over to see -- him and another man STOP He was gone up the river ; but he got back to-day , and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago STOP I had got so uneasy I could n't set still STOP I had to do something with my hands ; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it STOP My hands shook , and I was making a bad job of it STOP When the woman stopped talking I looked up , and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little STOP I put down the needle and thread , and let on to be interested -- and I was , too -- and says : Three hundred dollars is a power of money STOP I wish my mother could get it STOP Is your husband going over there to-night STOP Oh , yes STOP He went up-town with the man I was telling you of , to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun STOP They 'll go over after midnight STOP Could n't they see better if they was to wait till daytime STOP Yes STOP And could n't the nigger see better , too STOP After midnight he'll likely be asleep , and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark , if he 's got one STOP I did n't think of that STOP The woman kept looking at me pretty curious , and I did n't feel a bit comfortable STOP Pretty soon she says , What did you say your name was , honey STOP M -- Mary Williams STOP Somehow it did n't seem to me that I said it was Mary before , so I didn't look up -- seemed to me I said it was Sarah ; so I felt sort of cornered , and was afeared maybe I was looking it , too STOP I wished the woman would say something more ; the longer she set still the uneasier I was STOP But now she says : Honey , I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in STOP Oh , yes 'm , I did STOP Sarah Mary Williams STOP Sarah 's my first name STOP Some calls me Sarah , some calls me Mary STOP Oh , that 's the way of it STOP Yes 'm STOP I was feeling better then , but I wished I was out of there , anyway STOP I could n't look up yet STOP Well , the woman fell to talking about how hard times was , and how poor they had to live , and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place , and so forth and so on , and then I got easy again STOP She was right about the rats STOP You 'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while STOP She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone , or they would n't give her no peace STOP She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot , and said she was a good shot with it generly , but she 'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago , and didn't know whether she could throw true now STOP But she watched for a chance , and directly banged away at a rat ; but she missed him wide , and said Ouch STOP it hurt her arm so STOP Then she told me to try for the next one STOP I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back , but of course I did n't let on STOP I got the thing , and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive , and if he 'd a stayed where he was he 'd a been a tolerable sick rat STOP She said that was first-rate , and she reckoned I would hive the next one STOP She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back , and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with STOP I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them , and went on talking about her and her husband 's matters STOP But she broke off to say : Keep your eye on the rats STOP You better have the lead in your lap , handy STOP So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment , and I clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking STOP But only about a minute STOP Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face , and very pleasant , and says : Come , now , what 's your real name STOP Wh -- what , mum STOP What 's your real name STOP Is it Bill , or Tom , or Bob ? -- or what is it STOP I reckon I shook like a leaf , and I did n't know hardly what to do STOP But I says : Please to do n't poke fun at a poor girl like me , mum STOP If I 'm in the way here , I 'll -- No , you wo n't STOP Set down and stay where you are STOP I ai n't going to hurt you , and I ai n't going to tell on you , nuther STOP You just tell me your secret , and trust me STOP I 'll keep it ; and , what 's more , I 'll help you STOP So 'll my old man if you want him to STOP You see , you 're a runaway 'prentice , that 's all STOP It ai n't anything STOP There ai n't no harm in it STOP You 've been treated bad , and you made up your mind to cut STOP Bless you , child , I would n't tell on you STOP Tell me all about it now , that 's a good boy STOP So I said it would n't be no use to try to play it any longer , and I would just make a clean breast and tell her everything , but she musn't go back on her promise STOP Then I told her my father and mother was dead , and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river , and he treated me so bad I could n't stand it no longer ; he went away to be gone a couple of days , and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter 's old clothes and cleared out , and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles STOP I traveled nights , and hid daytimes and slept , and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way , and I had a-plenty STOP I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me , and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen STOP Goshen , child STOP This ai n't Goshen STOP This is St. Petersburg STOP Goshen's ten mile further up the river STOP Who told you this was Goshen STOP Why , a man I met at daybreak this morning , just as I was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep STOP He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand , and five mile would fetch me to Goshen STOP He was drunk , I reckon STOP He told you just exactly wrong STOP Well , he did act like he was drunk , but it ai n't no matter now STOP I got to be moving along STOP I 'll fetch Goshen before daylight STOP Hold on a minute STOP I 'll put you up a snack to eat STOP You might want it STOP So she put me up a snack , and says : Say , when a cow 's laying down , which end of her gets up first STOP Answer up prompt now -- do n't stop to study over it STOP Which end gets up first STOP The hind end , mum STOP Well , then , a horse STOP The for'rard end , mum STOP Which side of a tree does the moss grow on STOP North side STOP If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside , how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction STOP The whole fifteen , mum STOP Well , I reckon you _have_ lived in the country STOP I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again STOP What 's your real name , now STOP George Peters , mum STOP Well , try to remember it , George STOP Do n't forget and tell me it's Elexander before you go , and then get out by saying it 's George Elexander when I catch you STOP And do n't go about women in that old calico STOP You do a girl tolerable poor , but you might fool men , maybe STOP Bless you , child , when you set out to thread a needle do n't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it ; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it ; that 's the way a woman most always does , but a man always does t'other way STOP And when you throw at a rat or anything , hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can , and miss your rat about six or seven foot STOP Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder , like there was a pivot there for it to turn on , like a girl ; not from the wrist and elbow , with your arm out to one side , like a boy STOP And , mind you , when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart ; she do n't clap them together , the way you did when you catched the lump of lead STOP Why , I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle ; and I contrived the other things just to make certain STOP Now trot along to your uncle , Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters , and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus , which is me , and I 'll do what I can to get you out of it STOP Keep the river road all the way , and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you STOP The river road 's a rocky one , and your feet 'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen , I reckon STOP I went up the bank about fifty yards , and then I doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was , a good piece below the house STOP I jumped in , and was off in a hurry STOP I went up-stream far enough to make the head of the island , and then started across STOP I took off the sun-bonnet , for I did n't want no blinders on then STOP When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike , so I stops and listens ; the sound come faint over the water but clear -- eleven STOP When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow , though I was most winded , but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be , and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot STOP Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place , a mile and a half below , as hard as I could go STOP I landed , and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern STOP There Jim laid , sound asleep on the ground STOP I roused him out and says : Git up and hump yourself , Jim STOP There ai n't a minute to lose STOP They're after us STOP Jim never asked no questions , he never said a word ; but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared STOP By that time everything we had in the world was on our raft , and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid STOP We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing , and did n't show a candle outside after that STOP I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece , and took a look ; but if there was a boat around I could n't see it , for stars and shadows ai n't good to see by STOP Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade , past the foot of the island dead still -- never saying a word STOP STOP IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at last , and the raft did seem to go mighty slow STOP If a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore ; and it was well a boat did n't come , for we had n't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe , or a fishing-line , or anything to eat STOP We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things STOP It warn't good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft STOP If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I built , and watched it all night for Jim to come STOP Anyways , they stayed away from us , and if my building the fire never fooled them it war n't no fault of mine STOP I played it as low down on them as I could STOP When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side , and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet , and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there STOP A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth STOP We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side , and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place , so we war n't afraid of anybody running across us STOP We laid there all day , and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore , and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle STOP I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman ; and Jim said she was a smart one , and if she was to start after us herself she would n't set down and watch a camp fire -- no , sir , she 'd fetch a dog STOP Well , then , I said , why could n't she tell her husband to fetch a dog STOP Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start , and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that time , or else we would n't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village -- no , indeedy , we would be in that same old town again STOP So I said I did n't care what was the reason they did n't get us as long as they did n't STOP When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket , and looked up and down and across ; nothing in sight ; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy , and to keep the things dry STOP Jim made a floor for the wigwam , and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft , so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves STOP Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place ; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly ; the wigwam would keep it from being seen STOP We made an extra steering-oar , too , because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something STOP We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on , because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream , to keep from getting run over ; but we would n't have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a crossing ; for the river was pretty high yet , very low banks being still a little under water ; so up-bound boats did n't always run the channel , but hunted easy water STOP This second night we run between seven and eight hours , with a current that was making over four mile an hour STOP We catched fish and talked , and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness STOP It was kind of solemn , drifting down the big , still river , laying on our backs looking up at the stars , and we did n't ever feel like talking loud , and it war n't often that we laughed -- only a little kind of a low chuckle STOP We had mighty good weather as a general thing , and nothing ever happened to us at all -- that night , nor the next , nor the next STOP Every night we passed towns , some of them away up on black hillsides , nothing but just a shiny bed of lights ; not a house could you see STOP The fifth night we passed St. Louis , and it was like the whole world lit up STOP In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis , but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still night STOP There war n't a sound there ; everybody was asleep STOP Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little village , and buy ten or fifteen cents ' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat ; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that war n't roosting comfortable , and took him along STOP Pap always said , take a chicken when you get a chance , because if you do n't want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does , and a good deed ai n't ever forgot STOP I never see pap when he did n't want the chicken himself , but that is what he used to say , anyway STOP Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon , or a mushmelon , or a punkin , or some new corn , or things of that kind STOP Pap always said it war n't no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time ; but the widow said it warn't anything but a soft name for stealing , and no decent body would do it STOP Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right ; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we would n't borrow them any more -- then he reckoned it would n't be no harm to borrow the others STOP So we talked it over all one night , drifting along down the river , trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons , or the cantelopes , or the mushmelons , or what STOP But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory , and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons STOP We war n't feeling just right before that , but it was all comfortable now STOP I was glad the way it come out , too , because crabapples ai n't ever good , and the p'simmons would n't be ripe for two or three months yet STOP We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or did n't go to bed early enough in the evening STOP Take it all round , we lived pretty high STOP The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight , with a power of thunder and lightning , and the rain poured down in a solid sheet STOP We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself STOP When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead , and high , rocky bluffs on both sides STOP By and by says I , Hel-_lo_ , Jim , looky yonder STOP It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock STOP We was drifting straight down for her STOP The lightning showed her very distinct STOP She was leaning over , with part of her upper deck above water , and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear , and a chair by the big bell , with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it , when the flashes come STOP Well , it being away in the night and stormy , and all so mysterious-like , I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river STOP I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little , and see what there was there STOP So I says : Le 's land on her , Jim STOP But Jim was dead against it at first STOP He says : I doan ' want to go fool ' n 'long er no wrack STOP We 's doin ' blame ' well , en we better let blame ' well alone , as de good book says STOP Like as not dey 's a watchman on dat wrack STOP Watchman your grandmother , I says ; there ai n't nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house ; and do you reckon anybody 's going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this , when it 's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute STOP Jim could n't say nothing to that , so he did n't try STOP And besides , I says , we might borrow something worth having out of the captain 's stateroom STOP Seegars , I bet you -- and cost five cents apiece , solid cash STOP Steamboat captains is always rich , and get sixty dollars a month , and _they_ don't care a cent what a thing costs , you know , long as they want it STOP Stick a candle in your pocket ; I ca n't rest , Jim , till we give her a rummaging STOP Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing STOP Not for pie , he would n't STOP He 'd call it an adventure -- that 's what he 'd call it ; and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act STOP And would n't he throw style into it ? -- would n't he spread himself , nor nothing STOP Why , you 'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come STOP I wish Tom Sawyer _was_ here STOP Jim he grumbled a little , but give in STOP He said we must n't talk any more than we could help , and then talk mighty low STOP The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time , and we fetched the stabboard derrick , and made fast there STOP The deck was high out here STOP We went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard , in the dark , towards the texas , feeling our way slow with our feet , and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys , for it was so dark we could n't see no sign of them STOP Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight , and clumb on to it ; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain 's door , which was open , and by Jimminy , away down through the texas-hall we see a light STOP and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder STOP Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick , and told me to come along STOP I says , all right , and was going to start for the raft ; but just then I heard a voice wail out and say : Oh , please do n't , boys ; I swear I wo n't ever tell STOP Another voice said , pretty loud : It 's a lie , Jim Turner STOP You 've acted this way before STOP You always want more ' n your share of the truck , and you 've always got it , too , because you 've swore 't if you did n't you 'd tell STOP But this time you 've said it jest one time too many STOP You 're the meanest , treacherousest hound in this country STOP By this time Jim was gone for the raft STOP I was just a-biling with curiosity ; and I says to myself , Tom Sawyer would n't back out now , and so I wo n't either ; I 'm a-going to see what 's going on here STOP So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage , and crept aft in the dark till there war n't but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas STOP Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot , and two men standing over him , and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand , and the other one had a pistol STOP This one kept pointing the pistol at the man 's head on the floor , and saying : I 'd _like_ to STOP And I orter , too -- a mean skunk STOP The man on the floor would shrivel up and say , Oh , please do n't , Bill ; I hai n't ever goin ' to tell STOP And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say : 'Deed you _ai n't ! _ You never said no truer thing ' n that , you bet you STOP And once he said : Hear him beg STOP and yit if we had n't got the best of him and tied him he 'd a killed us both STOP And what _for_ STOP Jist for noth ' n STOP Jist because we stood on our _rights_ -- that 's what for STOP But I lay you ai n't a-goin ' to threaten nobody any more , Jim Turner STOP Put _up_ that pistol , Bill STOP Bill says : I do n't want to , Jake Packard STOP I 'm for killin ' him -- and did n't he kill old Hatfield jist the same way -- and do n't he deserve it STOP But I do n't _want_ him killed , and I 've got my reasons for it STOP Bless yo ' heart for them words , Jake Packard STOP I 'll never forgit you long 's I live STOP says the man on the floor , sort of blubbering STOP Packard did n't take no notice of that , but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark , and motioned Bill to come STOP I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards , but the boat slanted so that I could n't make very good time ; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side STOP The man came a-pawing along in the dark , and when Packard got to my stateroom , he says : Here -- come in here STOP And in he come , and Bill after him STOP But before they got in I was up in the upper berth , cornered , and sorry I come STOP Then they stood there , with their hands on the ledge of the berth , and talked STOP I could n't see them , but I could tell where they was by the whisky they 'd been having STOP I was glad I did n't drink whisky ; but it would n't made much difference anyway , because most of the time they could n't a treed me because I did n't breathe STOP I was too scared STOP And , besides , a body _couldn't_ breathe and hear such talk STOP They talked low and earnest STOP Bill wanted to kill Turner STOP He says : He 's said he 'll tell , and he will STOP If we was to give both our shares to him _now_ it would n't make no difference after the row and the way we 've served him STOP Shore 's you 're born , he 'll turn State 's evidence ; now you hear _me_ STOP I 'm for putting him out of his troubles STOP So 'm I , says Packard , very quiet STOP Blame it , I 'd sorter begun to think you was n't STOP Well , then , that 's all right STOP Le 's go and do it STOP Hold on a minute ; I hai n't had my say yit STOP You listen to me STOP Shooting 's good , but there 's quieter ways if the thing 's _got_ to be done STOP But what I say is this : it ai n't good sense to go court ' n around after a halter if you can git at what you 're up to in some way that's jist as good and at the same time do n't bring you into no resks STOP Ain't that so STOP You bet it is STOP But how you goin ' to manage it this time STOP Well , my idea is this : we 'll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we 've overlooked in the staterooms , and shove for shore and hide the truck STOP Then we 'll wait STOP Now I say it ai n't a-goin ' to be more ' n two hours befo ' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river STOP See STOP He 'll be drownded , and wo n't have nobody to blame for it but his own self STOP I reckon that 's a considerble sight better ' n killin ' of him STOP I 'm unfavorable to killin ' a man as long as you can git aroun ' it ; it ai n't good sense , it ai n't good morals STOP Ai n't I right STOP Yes , I reck ' n you are STOP But s'pose she _don't_ break up and wash off STOP Well , we can wait the two hours anyway and see , ca n't we STOP All right , then ; come along STOP So they started , and I lit out , all in a cold sweat , and scrambled forward STOP It was dark as pitch there ; but I said , in a kind of a coarse whisper , Jim STOP and he answered up , right at my elbow , with a sort of a moan , and I says : Quick , Jim , it ai n't no time for fooling around and moaning ; there 's a gang of murderers in yonder , and if we do n't hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows ca n't get away from the wreck there 's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix STOP But if we find their boat we can put _all_ of 'em in a bad fix -- for the sheriff 'll get 'em STOP Quick -- hurry STOP I 'll hunt the labboard side , you hunt the stabboard STOP You start at the raft , and -- Oh , my lordy , lordy STOP _raf ' _ STOP Dey ain ' no raf ' no mo ' ; she done broke loose en gone I -- en here we is STOP STOP WELL , I catched my breath and most fainted STOP Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that STOP But it war n't no time to be sentimentering STOP We'd _got_ to find that boat now -- had to have it for ourselves STOP So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side , and slow work it was , too -- seemed a week before we got to the stern STOP No sign of a boat STOP Jim said he did n't believe he could go any further -- so scared he hadn't hardly any strength left , he said STOP But I said , come on , if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix , sure STOP So on we prowled again STOP We struck for the stern of the texas , and found it , and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight , hanging on from shutter to shutter , for the edge of the skylight was in the water STOP When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff , sure enough STOP I could just barely see her STOP I felt ever so thankful STOP In another second I would a been aboard of her , but just then the door opened STOP One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me , and I thought I was gone ; but he jerked it in again , and says : Heave that blame lantern out o ' sight , Bill STOP He flung a bag of something into the boat , and then got in himself and set down STOP It was Packard STOP Then Bill _he_ come out and got in STOP Packard says , in a low voice : All ready -- shove off STOP I could n't hardly hang on to the shutters , I was so weak STOP But Bill says : Hold on -- 'd you go through him STOP No STOP Did n't you STOP No STOP So he 's got his share o ' the cash yet STOP Well , then , come along ; no use to take truck and leave money STOP Say , wo n't he suspicion what we 're up to STOP Maybe he wo n't STOP But we got to have it anyway STOP Come along STOP So they got out and went in STOP The door slammed to because it was on the careened side ; and in a half second I was in the boat , and Jim come tumbling after me STOP I out with my knife and cut the rope , and away we went STOP We did n't touch an oar , and we did n't speak nor whisper , nor hardly even breathe STOP We went gliding swift along , dead silent , past the tip of the paddle-box , and past the stern ; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck , and the darkness soaked her up , every last sign of her , and we was safe , and knowed it STOP When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second , and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat , and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was STOP Then Jim manned the oars , and we took out after our raft STOP Now was the first time that I begun to worry about the men -- I reckon I hadn't had time to before STOP I begun to think how dreadful it was , even for murderers , to be in such a fix STOP I says to myself , there ai n't no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet , and then how would I like it STOP So says I to Jim : The first light we see we 'll land a hundred yards below it or above it , in a place where it 's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff , and then I 'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn , and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape , so they can be hung when their time comes STOP But that idea was a failure ; for pretty soon it begun to storm again , and this time worse than ever STOP The rain poured down , and never a light showed ; everybody in bed , I reckon STOP We boomed along down the river , watching for lights and watching for our raft STOP After a long time the rain let up , but the clouds stayed , and the lightning kept whimpering , and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead , floating , and we made for it STOP It was the raft , and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again STOP We seen a light now away down to the right , on shore STOP So I said I would go for it STOP The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck STOP We hustled it on to the raft in a pile , and I told Jim to float along down , and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile , and keep it burning till I come ; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light STOP As I got down towards it three or four more showed -- up on a hillside STOP It was a village STOP I closed in above the shore light , and laid on my oars and floated STOP As I went by I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat STOP I skimmed around for the watchman , a-wondering whereabouts he slept ; and by and by I found him roosting on the bitts forward , with his head down between his knees STOP I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves , and begun to cry STOP He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way ; but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch , and then he says : Hello , what 's up STOP Do n't cry , bub STOP What 's the trouble STOP I says : Pap , and mam , and sis , and -- Then I broke down STOP He says : Oh , dang it now , _don't_ take on so ; we all has to have our troubles , and this ' n 'll come out all right STOP What 's the matter with 'em STOP They 're -- they 're -- are you the watchman of the boat STOP Yes , he says , kind of pretty-well-satisfied like STOP I 'm the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck-hand ; and sometimes I 'm the freight and passengers STOP I ai n't as rich as old Jim Hornback , and I ca n't be so blame ' generous and good to Tom , Dick , and Harry as what he is , and slam around money the way he does ; but I 've told him a many a time 't I would n't trade places with him ; for , says I , a sailor 's life 's the life for me , and I 'm derned if _I'd_ live two mile out o ' town , where there ai n't nothing ever goin' on , not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it STOP Says I -- I broke in and says : They 're in an awful peck of trouble , and -- _Who_ is STOP Why , pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker ; and if you 'd take your ferryboat and go up there -- Up where STOP Where are they STOP On the wreck STOP What wreck STOP Why , there ai n't but one STOP What , you do n't mean the Walter Scott STOP Yes STOP Good land STOP what are they doin ' _there_ , for gracious sakes STOP Well , they did n't go there a-purpose STOP I bet they did n't STOP Why , great goodness , there ai n't no chance for 'em if they do n't git off mighty quick STOP Why , how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape STOP Easy enough STOP Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town -- Yes , Booth 's Landing -- go on STOP She was a-visiting there at Booth 's Landing , and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend 's house , Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name -- and they lost their steering-oar , and swung around and went a-floating down , stern first , about two mile , and saddle-baggsed on the wreck , and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost , but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck STOP Well , about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow , and it was so dark we did n't notice the wreck till we was right on it ; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed ; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple -- and oh , he _was_ the best cretur ! -- I most wish 't it had been me , I do STOP My George STOP It 's the beatenest thing I ever struck STOP And _then_ what did you all do STOP Well , we hollered and took on , but it 's so wide there we couldn't make nobody hear STOP So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow STOP I was the only one that could swim , so I made a dash for it , and Miss Hooker she said if I did n't strike help sooner , come here and hunt up her uncle , and he 'd fix the thing STOP I made the land about a mile below , and been fooling along ever since , trying to get people to do something , but they said , 'What , in such a night and such a current STOP There ai n't no sense in it ; go for the steam ferry . STOP Now if you 'll go and -- By Jackson , I 'd _like_ to , and , blame it , I do n't know but I will ; but who in the dingnation 's a-going ' to _pay_ for it STOP Do you reckon your pap -- Why _that's_ all right STOP Miss Hooker she tole me , _particular_ , that her uncle Hornback -- Great guns STOP is _he_ her uncle STOP Looky here , you break for that light over yonder-way , and turn out west when you git there , and about a quarter of a mile out you 'll come to the tavern ; tell 'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback 's , and he 'll foot the bill STOP And do n't you fool around any , because he 'll want to know the news STOP Tell him I 'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town STOP Hump yourself , now ; I'm a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer STOP I struck for the light , but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out , and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards , and tucked myself in among some woodboats ; for I could n't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start STOP But take it all around , I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang , for not many would a done it STOP I wished the widow knowed about it STOP I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions , because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in STOP Well , before long here comes the wreck , dim and dusky , sliding along down STOP A kind of cold shiver went through me , and then I struck out for her STOP She was very deep , and I see in a minute there war n't much chance for anybody being alive in her STOP I pulled all around her and hollered a little , but there was n't any answer ; all dead still STOP I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang , but not much , for I reckoned if they could stand it I could STOP Then here comes the ferryboat ; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant ; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars , and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker 's remainders , because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them ; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore , and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river STOP It did seem a powerful long time before Jim 's light showed up ; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off STOP By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east ; so we struck for an island , and hid the raft , and sunk the skiff , and turned in and slept like dead people STOP STOP BY and by , when we got up , we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck , and found boots , and blankets , and clothes , and all sorts of other things , and a lot of books , and a spyglass , and three boxes of seegars STOP We had n't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives STOP The seegars was prime STOP We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking , and me reading the books , and having a general good time STOP I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat , and I said these kinds of things was adventures ; but he said he did n't want no more adventures STOP He said that when I went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died , because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could be fixed ; for if he did n't get saved he would get drownded ; and if he did get saved , whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward , and then Miss Watson would sell him South , sure STOP Well , he was right ; he was most always right ; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger STOP I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such , and how gaudy they dressed , and how much style they put on , and called each other your majesty , and your grace , and your lordship , and so on , 'stead of mister ; and Jim 's eyes bugged out , and he was interested STOP He says : I didn ' know dey was so many un um STOP I hai n't hearn 'bout none un um , skasely , but ole King Sollermun , onless you counts dem kings dat 's in a pack er k'yards STOP How much do a king git STOP Get STOP I says ;

but it war n't nothing but the flutter of a steamboat 's wheel away down , coming around the point ; so we come back STOP Yes , says I , and other times , when things is dull , they fuss with the parlyment ; and if everybody do n't go just so he whacks their heads off STOP But mostly they hang round the harem STOP Roun ' de which STOP Harem STOP What 's de harem STOP The place where he keeps his wives STOP Do n't you know about the harem STOP Solomon had one ;

but when I paddled ahead in the canoe , with the line to make fast , there war n't anything but little saplings to tie to STOP I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank , but there was a stiff current , and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went STOP I see the fog closing down , and it made me so sick and scared I could n't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me -- and then there war n't no raft in sight ; you could n't see twenty yards STOP I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern , and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke STOP But she did n't come STOP I was in such a hurry I had n't untied her STOP I got up and tried to untie her , but I was so excited my hands shook so I could n't hardly do anything with them STOP As soon as I got started I took out after the raft , hot and heavy , right down the towhead STOP That was all right as far as it went , but the towhead war n't sixty yards long , and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog , and had n't no more idea which way I was going than a dead man STOP Thinks I , it wo n't do to paddle ; first I know I 'll run into the bank or a towhead or something ; I got to set still and float , and yet it's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time STOP I whooped and listened STOP Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop , and up comes my spirits STOP I went tearing after it , listening sharp to hear it again STOP The next time it come I see I war n't heading for it , but heading away to the right of it STOP And the next time I was heading away to the left of it -- and not gaining on it much either , for I was flying around , this way and that and t'other , but it was going straight ahead all the time STOP I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan , and beat it all the time , but he never did , and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me STOP Well , I fought along , and directly I hears the whoop _behind_ me STOP I was tangled good now STOP That was somebody else 's whoop , or else I was turned around STOP I throwed the paddle down STOP I heard the whoop again ; it was behind me yet , but in a different place ; it kept coming , and kept changing its place , and I kept answering , till by and by it was in front of me again , and I knowed the current had swung the canoe 's head down-stream , and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering STOP I could n't tell nothing about voices in a fog , for nothing do n't look natural nor sound natural in a fog STOP The whooping went on , and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it , and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by , amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared , the currrent was tearing by them so swift STOP In another second or two it was solid white and still again STOP I set perfectly still then , listening to my heart thump , and I reckon I didn't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred STOP I just give up then STOP I knowed what the matter was STOP That cut bank was an island , and Jim had gone down t'other side of it STOP It war n't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes STOP It had the big timber of a regular island ; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide STOP I kept quiet , with my ears cocked , about fifteen minutes , I reckon STOP I was floating along , of course , four or five miles an hour ; but you don't ever think of that STOP No , you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on the water ; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you do n't think to yourself how fast _you're_ going , but you catch your breath and think , my STOP how that snag 's tearing along STOP If you think it ai n't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night , you try it once -- you 'll see STOP Next , for about a half an hour , I whoops now and then ; at last I hears the answer a long ways off , and tries to follow it , but I could n't do it , and directly I judged I 'd got into a nest of towheads , for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me -- sometimes just a narrow channel between , and some that I could n't see I knowed was there because I 'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks STOP Well , I war n't long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads ; and I only tried to chase them a little while , anyway , because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern STOP You never knowed a sound dodge around so , and swap places so quick and so much STOP I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times , to keep from knocking the islands out of the river ; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then , or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing -- it was floating a little faster than what I was STOP Well , I seemed to be in the open river again by and by , but I couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres STOP I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag , maybe , and it was all up with him STOP I was good and tired , so I laid down in the canoe and said I would n't bother no more STOP I didn't want to go to sleep , of course ; but I was so sleepy I could n't help it ; so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap STOP But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap , for when I waked up the stars was shining bright , the fog was all gone , and I was spinning down a big bend stern first STOP First I did n't know where I was ; I thought I was dreaming ; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week STOP It was a monstrous big river here , with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks ; just a solid wall , as well as I could see by the stars STOP I looked away down-stream , and seen a black speck on the water STOP I took after it ; but when I got to it it war n't nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together STOP Then I see another speck , and chased that ; then another , and this time I was right STOP It was the raft STOP When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees , asleep , with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar STOP The other oar was smashed off , and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt STOP So she 'd had a rough time STOP I made fast and laid down under Jim 's nose on the raft , and began to gap , and stretch my fists out against Jim , and says : Hello , Jim , have I been asleep STOP Why did n't you stir me up STOP Goodness gracious , is dat you , Huck STOP En you ain ' dead -- you ain' drownded -- you 's back agin STOP It 's too good for true , honey , it 's too good for true STOP Lem me look at you chile , lem me feel o ' you STOP No , you ain' dead STOP you 's back agin , 'live en soun ' , jis de same ole Huck -- de same ole Huck , thanks to goodness STOP What 's the matter with you , Jim STOP You been a-drinking STOP Drinkin ' STOP Has I ben a-drinkin ' STOP Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin ' STOP Well , then , what makes you talk so wild STOP How does I talk wild STOP _How_ STOP Why , hai n't you been talking about my coming back , and all that stuff , as if I 'd been gone away STOP Huck -- Huck Finn , you look me in de eye ; look me in de eye STOP _Hain't_ you ben gone away STOP Gone away STOP Why , what in the nation do you mean STOP I hai n't been gone anywheres STOP Where would I go to STOP Well , looky here , boss , dey 's sumf ' n wrong , dey is STOP Is I _me_ , or who _is_ I STOP Is I heah , or whah _is_ I STOP Now dat 's what I wants to know STOP Well , I think you 're here , plain enough , but I think you 're a tangle-headed old fool , Jim STOP I is , is I STOP Well , you answer me dis : Did n't you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas ' to de tow-head STOP No , I did n't STOP What tow-head STOP I hai n't see no tow-head STOP You hai n't seen no towhead STOP Looky here , did n't de line pull loose en de raf ' go a-hummin ' down de river , en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog STOP What fog STOP Why , de fog ! -- de fog dat 's been aroun ' all night STOP En did n't you whoop , en did n't I whoop , tell we got mix ' up in de islands en one un us got los ' en t'other one was jis ' as good as los ' , 'kase he didn ' know whah he wuz STOP En did n't I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos ' git drownded STOP Now ain ' dat so , boss -- ai n't it so STOP You answer me dat STOP Well , this is too many for me , Jim STOP I hai n't seen no fog , nor no islands , nor no troubles , nor nothing STOP I been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago , and I reckon I done the same STOP You could n't a got drunk in that time , so of course you 've been dreaming STOP Dad fetch it , how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes STOP Well , hang it all , you did dream it , because there did n't any of it happen STOP But , Huck , it 's all jis ' as plain to me as -- It do n't make no difference how plain it is ; there ai n't nothing in it STOP I know , because I 've been here all the time STOP Jim did n't say nothing for about five minutes , but set there studying over it STOP Then he says : Well , den , I reck ' n I did dream it , Huck ; but dog my cats ef it ain't de powerfullest dream I ever see STOP En I hai n't ever had no dream b'fo' dat 's tired me like dis one STOP Oh , well , that 's all right , because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes STOP But this one was a staving dream ; tell me all about it , Jim STOP So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through , just as it happened , only he painted it up considerable STOP Then he said he must start in and 'terpret it , because it was sent for a warning STOP He said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good , but the current was another man that would get us away from him STOP The whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then , and if we didn't try hard to make out to understand them they 'd just take us into bad luck , 'stead of keeping us out of it STOP The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks , but if we minded our business and did n't talk back and aggravate them , we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river , which was the free States , and would n't have no more trouble STOP It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft , but it was clearing up again now STOP Oh , well , that 's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes , Jim , I says ; but what does _these_ things stand for STOP It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar STOP You could see them first-rate now STOP Jim looked at the trash , and then looked at me , and back at the trash again STOP He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he could n't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away STOP But when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling , and says : What do dey stan ' for STOP I'se gwyne to tell you STOP When I got all wore out wid work , en wid de callin ' for you , en went to sleep , my heart wuz mos ' broke bekase you wuz los ' , en I didn ' k'yer no ' mo ' what become er me en de raf ' STOP En when I wake up en fine you back agin , all safe en soun ' , de tears come , en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo' foot , I 's so thankful STOP En all you wuz thinkin ' 'bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie STOP Dat truck dah is _trash_ ; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren 's en makes 'em ashamed STOP Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam , and went in there without saying anything but that STOP But that was enough STOP It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back STOP It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger ; but I done it , and I war n't ever sorry for it afterwards , neither STOP I did n't do him no more mean tricks , and I would n't done that one if I 'd a knowed it would make him feel that way STOP STOP WE slept most all day , and started out at night , a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession STOP She had four long sweeps at each end , so we judged she carried as many as thirty men , likely STOP She had five big wigwams aboard , wide apart , and an open camp fire in the middle , and a tall flag-pole at each end STOP There was a power of style about her STOP It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that STOP We went drifting down into a big bend , and the night clouded up and got hot STOP The river was very wide , and was walled with solid timber on both sides ; you could n't see a break in it hardly ever , or a light STOP We talked about Cairo , and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it STOP I said likely we would n't , because I had heard say there war n't but about a dozen houses there , and if they did n't happen to have them lit up , how was we going to know we was passing a town STOP Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there , that would show STOP But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again STOP That disturbed Jim -- and me too STOP So the question was , what to do STOP I said , paddle ashore the first time a light showed , and tell them pap was behind , coming along with a trading-scow , and was a green hand at the business , and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo STOP Jim thought it was a good idea , so we took a smoke on it and waited STOP There war n't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town , and not pass it without seeing it STOP He said he 'd be mighty sure to see it , because he 'd be a free man the minute he seen it , but if he missed it he 'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom STOP Every little while he jumps up and says : Dah she is STOP But it war n't STOP It was Jack-o'-lanterns , or lightning bugs ; so he set down again , and went to watching , same as before STOP Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom STOP Well , I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish , too , to hear him , because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free -- and who was to blame for it STOP Why , _me_ STOP I could n't get that out of my conscience , no how nor no way STOP It got to troubling me so I couldn't rest ; I could n't stay still in one place STOP It had n't ever come home to me before , what this thing was that I was doing STOP But now it did ; and it stayed with me , and scorched me more and more STOP I tried to make out to myself that I war n't to blame , because I did n't run Jim off from his rightful owner ; but it war n't no use , conscience up and says , every time , But you knowed he was running for his freedom , and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody STOP That was so -- I could n't get around that noway STOP That was where it pinched STOP Conscience says to me , What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word STOP What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean STOP Why , she tried to learn you your book , she tried to learn you your manners , she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how STOP _That's_ what she done STOP I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead STOP I fidgeted up and down the raft , abusing myself to myself , and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me STOP We neither of us could keep still STOP Every time he danced around and says , Dah 's Cairo STOP it went through me like a shot , and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness STOP Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself STOP He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent , and when he got enough he would buy his wife , which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived ; and then they would both work to buy the two children , and if their master would n't sell them , they 'd get an Ab'litionist to go and steal them STOP It most froze me to hear such talk STOP He would n't ever dared to talk such talk in his life before STOP Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free STOP It was according to the old saying , Give a nigger an inch and he 'll take an ell STOP Thinks I , this is what comes of my not thinking STOP Here was this nigger , which I had as good as helped to run away , coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children -- children that belonged to a man I did n't even know ; a man that had n't ever done me no harm STOP I was sorry to hear Jim say that , it was such a lowering of him STOP My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever , until at last I says to it , Let up on me -- it ai n't too late yet -- I 'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell STOP I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off STOP All my troubles was gone STOP I went to looking out sharp for a light , and sort of singing to myself STOP By and by one showed STOP Jim sings out : We 's safe , Huck , we 's safe STOP Jump up and crack yo ' heels STOP Dat 's de good ole Cairo at las ' , I jis knows it STOP I says : I 'll take the canoe and go and see , Jim STOP It might n't be , you know STOP He jumped and got the canoe ready , and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on , and give me the paddle ; and as I shoved off , he says : Pooty soon I 'll be a-shout ' n ' for joy , en I 'll say , it 's all on accounts o ' Huck ; I 's a free man , en I could n't ever ben free ef it hadn ' ben for Huck ; Huck done it STOP Jim wo n't ever forgit you , Huck ; you 's de bes ' fren ' Jim 's ever had ; en you 's de _only_ fren ' ole Jim's got now STOP I was paddling off , all in a sweat to tell on him ; but when he says this , it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me STOP I went along slow then , and I war n't right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I war n't STOP When I was fifty yards off , Jim says : Dah you goes , de ole true Huck ; de on ' y white genlman dat ever kep ' his promise to ole Jim STOP Well , I just felt sick STOP But I says , I _got_ to do it -- I ca n't get _out_ of it STOP Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns , and they stopped and I stopped STOP One of them says : What 's that yonder STOP A piece of a raft , I says STOP Do you belong on it STOP Yes , sir STOP Any men on it STOP Only one , sir STOP Well , there 's five niggers run off to-night up yonder , above the head of the bend STOP Is your man white or black STOP I did n't answer up prompt STOP I tried to , but the words would n't come STOP I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it , but I war n't man enough -- had n't the spunk of a rabbit STOP I see I was weakening ; so I just give up trying , and up and says : He 's white STOP I reckon we 'll go and see for ourselves STOP I wish you would , says I , because it 's pap that 's there , and maybe you 'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is STOP He 's sick -- and so is mam and Mary Ann STOP Oh , the devil STOP we 're in a hurry , boy STOP But I s'pose we 've got to STOP Come , buckle to your paddle , and let 's get along STOP I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars STOP When we had made a stroke or two , I says : Pap 'll be mighty much obleeged to you , I can tell you STOP Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore , and I ca n't do it by myself STOP Well , that 's infernal mean STOP Odd , too STOP Say , boy , what 's the matter with your father STOP It 's the -- a -- the -- well , it ai n't anything much STOP They stopped pulling STOP It war n't but a mighty little ways to the raft now STOP One says : Boy , that 's a lie STOP What _is_ the matter with your pap STOP Answer up square now , and it 'll be the better for you STOP I will , sir , I will , honest -- but do n't leave us , please STOP It's the -- the -- Gentlemen , if you 'll only pull ahead , and let me heave you the headline , you wo n't have to come a-near the raft -- please do STOP Set her back , John , set her back STOP says one STOP They backed water STOP Keep away , boy -- keep to looard STOP Confound it , I just expect the wind has blowed it to us STOP Your pap 's got the small-pox , and you know it precious well STOP Why did n't you come out and say so STOP Do you want to spread it all over STOP Well , says I , a-blubbering , I 've told everybody before , and they just went away and left us STOP Poor devil , there 's something in that STOP We are right down sorry for you , but we -- well , hang it , we do n't want the small-pox , you see STOP Look here , I 'll tell you what to do STOP Do n't you try to land by yourself , or you 'll smash everything to pieces STOP You float along down about twenty miles , and you 'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river STOP It will be long after sun-up then , and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever STOP Do n't be a fool again , and let people guess what is the matter STOP Now we 're trying to do you a kindness ; so you just put twenty miles between us , that 's a good boy STOP It would n't do any good to land yonder where the light is -- it 's only a wood-yard STOP Say , I reckon your father 's poor , and I 'm bound to say he's in pretty hard luck STOP Here , I 'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board , and you get it when it floats by STOP I feel mighty mean to leave you ; but my kingdom STOP it wo n't do to fool with small-pox , do n't you see STOP Hold on , Parker , says the other man , here 's a twenty to put on the board for me STOP Good-bye , boy ; you do as Mr. Parker told you , and you'll be all right STOP That 's so , my boy -- good-bye , good-bye STOP If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them , and you can make some money by it STOP Good-bye , sir , says I ; I wo n't let no runaway niggers get by me if I can help it STOP They went off and I got aboard the raft , feeling bad and low , because I knowed very well I had done wrong , and I see it war n't no use for me to try to learn to do right ; a body that do n't get _started_ right when he 's little ai n't got no show -- when the pinch comes there ai n't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work , and so he gets beat STOP Then I thought a minute , and says to myself , hold on ; s'pose you 'd a done right and give Jim up , would you felt better than what you do now STOP No , says I , I 'd feel bad -- I 'd feel just the same way I do now STOP Well , then , says I , what 's the use you learning to do right when it 's troublesome to do right and ai n't no trouble to do wrong , and the wages is just the same STOP I was stuck STOP I could n't answer that STOP So I reckoned I would n't bother no more about it , but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time STOP I went into the wigwam ;

but it was high ground , so I did n't go STOP No high ground about Cairo , Jim said STOP I had forgot it STOP We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank STOP I begun to suspicion something STOP So did Jim STOP I says : Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night STOP He says : Doan ' le 's talk about it , Huck STOP Po ' niggers ca n't have no luck STOP I awluz 'spected dat rattlesnake-skin war n't done wid its work STOP I wish I 'd never seen that snake-skin , Jim -- I do wish I 'd never laid eyes on it STOP It ai n't yo ' fault , Huck ; you didn ' know STOP Do n't you blame yo'self 'bout it STOP When it was daylight , here was the clear Ohio water inshore , sure enough , and outside was the old regular Muddy STOP So it was all up with Cairo STOP We talked it all over STOP It would n't do to take to the shore ; we couldn't take the raft up the stream , of course STOP There war n't no way but to wait for dark , and start back in the canoe and take the chances STOP So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket , so as to be fresh for the work , and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone STOP We did n't say a word for a good while STOP There war n't anything to say STOP We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin ; so what was the use to talk about it STOP It would only look like we was finding fault , and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck -- and keep on fetching it , too , till we knowed enough to keep still STOP By and by we talked about what we better do , and found there war n't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in STOP We war n't going to borrow it when there warn't anybody around , the way pap would do , for that might set people after us STOP So we shoved out after dark on the raft STOP Anybody that do n't believe yet that it 's foolishness to handle a snake-skin , after all that that snake-skin done for us , will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us STOP The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore STOP But we did n't see no rafts laying up ; so we went along during three hours and more STOP Well , the night got gray and ruther thick , which is the next meanest thing to fog STOP You ca n't tell the shape of the river , and you ca n't see no distance STOP It got to be very late and still , and then along comes a steamboat up the river STOP We lit the lantern , and judged she would see it STOP Up-stream boats did n't generly come close to us ; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs ; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river STOP We could hear her pounding along , but we did n't see her good till she was close STOP She aimed right for us STOP Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching ; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep , and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs , and thinks he 's mighty smart STOP Well , here she comes , and we said she was going to try and shave us ; but she did n't seem to be sheering off a bit STOP She was a big one , and she was coming in a hurry , too , looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it ; but all of a sudden she bulged out , big and scary , with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth , and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us STOP There was a yell at us , and a jingling of bells to stop the engines , a powwow of cussing , and whistling of steam -- and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other , she come smashing straight through the raft STOP I dived -- and I aimed to find the bottom , too , for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me , and I wanted it to have plenty of room STOP I could always stay under water a minute ; this time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half STOP Then I bounced for the top in a hurry , for I was nearly busting STOP I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose , and puffed a bit STOP Of course there was a booming current ; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them , for they never cared much for raftsmen ; so now she was churning along up the river , out of sight in the thick weather , though I could hear her STOP I sung out for Jim about a dozen times , but I did n't get any answer ; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was treading water , and struck out for shore , shoving it ahead of me STOP But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore , which meant that I was in a crossing ; so I changed off and went that way STOP It was one of these long , slanting , two-mile crossings ; so I was a good long time in getting over STOP I made a safe landing , and clumb up the bank STOP I could n't see but a little ways , but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more , and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it STOP I was going to rush by and get away , but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me , and I knowed better than to move another peg STOP STOP IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out , and says : Be done , boys STOP Who 's there STOP I says : It 's me STOP Who 's me STOP George Jackson , sir STOP What do you want STOP I do n't want nothing , sir STOP I only want to go along by , but the dogs wo n't let me STOP What are you prowling around here this time of night for -- hey STOP I war n't prowling around , sir , I fell overboard off of the steamboat STOP Oh , you did , did you STOP Strike a light there , somebody STOP What did you say your name was STOP George Jackson , sir STOP I 'm only a boy STOP Look here , if you 're telling the truth you need n't be afraid -- nobody'll hurt you STOP But do n't try to budge ; stand right where you are STOP Rouse out Bob and Tom , some of you , and fetch the guns STOP George Jackson , is there anybody with you STOP No , sir , nobody STOP I heard the people stirring around in the house now , and see a light STOP The man sung out : Snatch that light away , Betsy , you old fool -- ai n't you got any sense STOP Put it on the floor behind the front door STOP Bob , if you and Tom are ready , take your places STOP All ready STOP Now , George Jackson , do you know the Shepherdsons STOP No , sir ; I never heard of them STOP Well , that may be so , and it may n't STOP Now , all ready STOP Step forward , George Jackson STOP And mind , do n't you hurry -- come mighty slow STOP If there's anybody with you , let him keep back -- if he shows himself he 'll be shot STOP Come along now STOP Come slow ; push the door open yourself -- just enough to squeeze in , d ' you hear STOP I did n't hurry ; I could n't if I 'd a wanted to STOP I took one slow step at a time and there war n't a sound , only I thought I could hear my heart STOP The dogs were as still as the humans , but they followed a little behind me STOP When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting STOP I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said , There , that 's enough -- put your head in STOP I done it , but I judged they would take it off STOP The candle was on the floor , and there they all was , looking at me , and me at them , for about a quarter of a minute : Three big men with guns pointed at me , which made me wince , I tell you ; the oldest , gray and about sixty , the other two thirty or more -- all of them fine and handsome -- and the sweetest old gray-headed lady , and back of her two young women which I could n't see right well STOP The old gentleman says : There ; I reckon it 's all right STOP Come in STOP As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it , and told the young men to come in with their guns , and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor , and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows -- there war n't none on the side STOP They held the candle , and took a good look at me , and all said , Why , _he_ ai n't a Shepherdson -- no , there ai n't any Shepherdson about him STOP Then the old man said he hoped I would n't mind being searched for arms , because he did n't mean no harm by it -- it was only to make sure STOP So he did n't pry into my pockets , but only felt outside with his hands , and said it was all right STOP He told me to make myself easy and at home , and tell all about myself ; but the old lady says : Why , bless you , Saul , the poor thing 's as wet as he can be ; and don't you reckon it may be he 's hungry STOP True for you , Rachel -- I forgot STOP So the old lady says : Betsy ( this was a nigger woman ) , you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can , poor thing ; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck and tell him -- oh , here he is himself STOP Buck , take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that 's dry STOP Buck looked about as old as me -- thirteen or fourteen or along there , though he was a little bigger than me STOP He had n't on anything but a shirt , and he was very frowzy-headed STOP He came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes , and he was dragging a gun along with the other one STOP He says : Ai n't they no Shepherdsons around STOP They said , no , 't was a false alarm STOP Well , he says , if they 'd a ben some , I reckon I 'd a got one STOP They all laughed , and Bob says : Why , Buck , they might have scalped us all , you 've been so slow in coming STOP Well , nobody come after me , and it ai n't right I 'm always kept down ; I do n't get no show STOP Never mind , Buck , my boy , says the old man , you 'll have show enough , all in good time , do n't you fret about that STOP Go 'long with you now , and do as your mother told you STOP When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his , and I put them on STOP While I was at it he asked me what my name was , but before I could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday , and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went out STOP I said I did n't know ; I had n't heard about it before , no way STOP Well , guess , he says STOP How 'm I going to guess , says I , when I never heard tell of it before STOP But you can guess , ca n't you STOP It 's just as easy STOP _Which_ candle STOP I says STOP Why , any candle , he says STOP I do n't know where he was , says I ; where was he STOP Why , he was in the _dark_ STOP That 's where he was STOP Well , if you knowed where he was , what did you ask me for STOP Why , blame it , it 's a riddle , do n't you see STOP Say , how long are you going to stay here STOP You got to stay always STOP We can just have booming times -- they do n't have no school now STOP Do you own a dog STOP I 've got a dog -- and he 'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in STOP Do you like to comb up Sundays , and all that kind of foolishness STOP You bet I do n't , but ma she makes me STOP Confound these ole britches STOP I reckon I 'd better put 'em on , but I 'd ruther not , it 's so warm STOP Are you all ready STOP All right STOP Come along , old hoss STOP Cold corn-pone , cold corn-beef , butter and buttermilk -- that is what they had for me down there , and there ai n't nothing better that ever I've come across yet STOP Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes , except the nigger woman , which was gone , and the two young women STOP They all smoked and talked , and I eat and talked STOP The young women had quilts around them , and their hair down their backs STOP They all asked me questions , and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw , and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more , and Bill went to hunt them and he war n't heard of no more , and Tom and Mort died , and then there war n't nobody but just me and pap left , and he was just trimmed down to nothing , on account of his troubles ; so when he died I took what there was left , because the farm did n't belong to us , and started up the river , deck passage , and fell overboard ; and that was how I come to be here STOP So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it STOP Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed , and I went to bed with Buck , and when I waked up in the morning , drat it all , I had forgot what my name was STOP So I laid there about an hour trying to think , and when Buck waked up I says : Can you spell , Buck STOP Yes , he says STOP I bet you ca n't spell my name , says I. I bet you what you dare I can , says he STOP All right , says I , go ahead STOP G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n -- there now , he says STOP Well , says I , you done it , but I did n't think you could STOP It ai n't no slouch of a name to spell -- right off without studying STOP I set it down , private , because somebody might want _me_ to spell it next , and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it STOP It was a mighty nice family , and a mighty nice house , too STOP I hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style STOP It did n't have an iron latch on the front door , nor a wooden one with a buckskin string , but a brass knob to turn , the same as houses in town STOP There war n't no bed in the parlor , nor a sign of a bed ; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them STOP There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom , and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick ; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown , same as they do in town STOP They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log STOP There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece , with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front , and a round place in the middle of it for the sun , and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it STOP It was beautiful to hear that clock tick ; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape , she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out STOP They would n't took any money for her STOP Well , there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock , made out of something like chalk , and painted up gaudy STOP By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery , and a crockery dog by the other ; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked , but did n't open their mouths nor look different nor interested STOP They squeaked through underneath STOP There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things STOP On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it , which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is , but they war n't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk , or whatever it was , underneath STOP This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth , with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it , and a painted border all around STOP It come all the way from Philadelphia , they said STOP There was some books , too , piled up perfectly exact , on each corner of the table STOP One was a big family Bible full of pictures STOP One was Pilgrim 's Progress , about a man that left his family , it did n't say why STOP I read considerable in it now and then STOP The statements was interesting , but tough STOP Another was Friendship 's Offering , full of beautiful stuff and poetry ; but I didn't read the poetry STOP Another was Henry Clay 's Speeches , and another was Dr. Gunn 's Family Medicine , which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead STOP There was a hymn book , and a lot of other books STOP And there was nice split-bottom chairs , and perfectly sound , too -- not bagged down in the middle and busted , like an old basket STOP They had pictures hung on the walls -- mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes , and battles , and Highland Marys , and one called Signing the Declaration STOP There was some that they called crayons , which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old STOP They was different from any pictures I ever see before -- blacker , mostly , than is common STOP One was a woman in a slim black dress , belted small under the armpits , with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves , and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil , and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape , and very wee black slippers , like a chisel , and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow , under a weeping willow , and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule , and underneath the picture it said Shall I Never See Thee More Alas STOP Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head , and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back , and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up , and underneath the picture it said I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas STOP There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon , and tears running down her cheeks ; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it , and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth , and underneath the picture it said And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas STOP These was all nice pictures , I reckon , but I did n't somehow seem to take to them , because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods STOP Everybody was sorry she died , because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do , and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost STOP But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard STOP She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick , and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done , but she never got the chance STOP It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown , standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off , with her hair all down her back , and looking up to the moon , with the tears running down her face , and she had two arms folded across her breast , and two arms stretched out in front , and two more reaching up towards the moon -- and the idea was to see which pair would look best , and then scratch out all the other arms ; but , as I was saying , she died before she got her mind made up , and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room , and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it STOP Other times it was hid with a little curtain STOP The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face , but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery , seemed to me STOP This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive , and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer , and write poetry after them out of her own head STOP It was very good poetry STOP This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded : ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS , DEC'D And did young Stephen sicken , And did young Stephen die STOP And did the sad hearts thicken , And did the mourners cry STOP No ; such was not the fate of Young Stephen Dowling Bots ; Though sad hearts round him thickened , 'T was not from sickness ' shots STOP No whooping-cough did rack his frame , Nor measles drear with spots ; Not these impaired the sacred name Of Stephen Dowling Bots STOP Despised love struck not with woe That head of curly knots , Nor stomach troubles laid him low , Young Stephen Dowling Bots STOP O no STOP Then list with tearful eye , Whilst I his fate do tell STOP His soul did from this cold world fly By falling down a well STOP They got him out and emptied him ; Alas it was too late ; His spirit was gone for to sport aloft In the realms of the good and great STOP If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen , there ai n't no telling what she could a done by and by STOP Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing STOP She did n't ever have to stop to think STOP He said she would slap down a line , and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one , and go ahead STOP She war n't particular ; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful STOP Every time a man died , or a woman died , or a child died , she would be on hand with her tribute before he was cold STOP She called them tributes STOP The neighbors said it was the doctor first , then Emmeline , then the undertaker -- the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once , and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person 's name , which was Whistler STOP She war n't ever the same after that ; she never complained , but she kinder pined away and did not live long STOP Poor thing , many 's the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little STOP I liked all that family , dead ones and all , and war n't going to let anything come between us STOP Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive , and it did n't seem right that there war n't nobody to make some about her now she was gone ; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself , but I could n't seem to make it go somehow STOP They kept Emmeline's room trim and nice , and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive , and nobody ever slept there STOP The old lady took care of the room herself , though there was plenty of niggers , and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly STOP Well , as I was saying about the parlor , there was beautiful curtains on the windows : white , with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls , and cattle coming down to drink STOP There was a little old piano , too , that had tin pans in it , I reckon , and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing The Last Link is Broken and play The Battle of Prague on it STOP The walls of all the rooms was plastered , and most had carpets on the floors , and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside STOP It was a double house , and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored , and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day , and it was a cool , comfortable place STOP Nothing could n't be better STOP And war n't the cooking good , and just bushels of it too STOP STOP COL. Grangerford was a gentleman , you see STOP He was a gentleman all over ; and so was his family STOP He was well born , as the saying is , and that 's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse , so the Widow Douglas said , and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town ; and pap he always said it , too , though he war n't no more quality than a mudcat himself STOP Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim , and had a darkish-paly complexion , not a sign of red in it anywheres ; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face , and he had the thinnest kind of lips , and the thinnest kind of nostrils , and a high nose , and heavy eyebrows , and the blackest kind of eyes , sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you , as you may say STOP His forehead was high , and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders STOP His hands was long and thin , and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it ; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it STOP He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it STOP There war n't no frivolishness about him , not a bit , and he war n't ever loud STOP He was as kind as he could be -- you could feel that , you know , and so you had confidence STOP Sometimes he smiled , and it was good to see ; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole , and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows , you wanted to climb a tree first , and find out what the matter was afterwards STOP He did n't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners -- everybody was always good-mannered where he was STOP Everybody loved to have him around , too ; he was sunshine most always -- I mean he made it seem like good weather STOP When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute , and that was enough ; there would n't nothing go wrong again for a week STOP When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day , and did n't set down again till they had set down STOP Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was , and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him , and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom 's and Bob 's was mixed , and then they bowed and said , Our duty to you , sir , and madam ; and _they_ bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you , and so they drank , all three , and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers , and give it to me and Buck , and we drank to the old people too STOP Bob was the oldest and Tom next -- tall , beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces , and long black hair and black eyes STOP They dressed in white linen from head to foot , like the old gentleman , and wore broad Panama hats STOP Then there was Miss Charlotte ; she was twenty-five , and tall and proud and grand , but as good as she could be when she war n't stirred up ; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks , like her father STOP She was beautiful STOP So was her sister , Miss Sophia , but it was a different kind STOP She was gentle and sweet like a dove , and she was only twenty STOP Each person had their own nigger to wait on them -- Buck too STOP My nigger had a monstrous easy time , because I war n't used to having anybody do anything for me , but Buck 's was on the jump most of the time STOP This was all there was of the family now , but there used to be more -- three sons ; they got killed ; and Emmeline that died STOP The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers STOP Sometimes a stack of people would come there , horseback , from ten or fifteen mile around , and stay five or six days , and have such junketings round about and on the river , and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes , and balls at the house nights STOP These people was mostly kinfolks of the family STOP The men brought their guns with them STOP It was a handsome lot of quality , I tell you STOP There was another clan of aristocracy around there -- five or six families -- mostly of the name of Shepherdson STOP They was as high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords STOP The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing , which was about two mile above our house ; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses STOP One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting , and heard a horse coming STOP We was crossing the road STOP Buck says : Quick STOP Jump for the woods STOP We done it , and then peeped down the woods through the leaves STOP Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road , setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier STOP He had his gun across his pommel STOP I had seen him before STOP It was young Harney Shepherdson STOP I heard Buck 's gun go off at my ear , and Harney 's hat tumbled off from his head STOP He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid STOP But we did n't wait STOP We started through the woods on a run STOP The woods war n't thick , so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet , and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun ; and then he rode away the way he come -- to get his hat , I reckon , but I could n't see STOP We never stopped running till we got home STOP The old gentleman 's eyes blazed a minute -- 't was pleasure , mainly , I judged -- then his face sort of smoothed down , and he says , kind of gentle : I do n't like that shooting from behind a bush STOP Why did n't you step into the road , my boy STOP The Shepherdsons do n't , father STOP They always take advantage STOP Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling his tale , and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped STOP The two young men looked dark , but never said nothing STOP Miss Sophia she turned pale , but the color come back when she found the man war n't hurt STOP Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by ourselves , I says : Did you want to kill him , Buck STOP Well , I bet I did STOP What did he do to you STOP Him STOP He never done nothing to me STOP Well , then , what did you want to kill him for STOP Why , nothing -- only it 's on account of the feud STOP What 's a feud STOP Why , where was you raised STOP Do n't you know what a feud is STOP Never heard of it before -- tell me about it STOP Well , says Buck , a feud is this way : A man has a quarrel with another man , and kills him ; then that other man 's brother kills _him_ ; then the other brothers , on both sides , goes for one another ; then the _cousins_ chip in -- and by and by everybody 's killed off , and there ain't no more feud STOP But it 's kind of slow , and takes a long time STOP Has this one been going on long , Buck STOP Well , I should _reckon_ STOP It started thirty year ago , or som'ers along there STOP There was trouble 'bout something , and then a lawsuit to settle it ; and the suit went agin one of the men , and so he up and shot the man that won the suit -- which he would naturally do , of course STOP Anybody would STOP What was the trouble about , Buck ? -- land STOP I reckon maybe -- I do n't know STOP Well , who done the shooting STOP Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson STOP Laws , how do I know STOP It was so long ago STOP Do n't anybody know STOP Oh , yes , pa knows , I reckon , and some of the other old people ; but they do n't know now what the row was about in the first place STOP Has there been many killed , Buck STOP Yes ; right smart chance of funerals STOP But they do n't always kill STOP Pa's got a few buckshot in him ; but he do n't mind it 'cuz he do n't weigh much , anyway STOP Bob 's been carved up some with a bowie , and Tom 's been hurt once or twice STOP Has anybody been killed this year , Buck STOP Yes ; we got one and they got one STOP 'Bout three months ago my cousin Bud , fourteen year old , was riding through the woods on t'other side of the river , and did n't have no weapon with him , which was blame' foolishness , and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him , and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin ' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind ; and 'stead of jumping off and taking to the brush , Bud 'lowed he could out-run him ; so they had it , nip and tuck , for five mile or more , the old man a-gaining all the time ; so at last Bud seen it war n't any use , so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front , you know , and the old man he rode up and shot him down STOP But he did n't git much chance to enjoy his luck , for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out STOP I reckon that old man was a coward , Buck STOP I reckon he _warn't_ a coward STOP Not by a blame ' sight STOP There ai n't a coward amongst them Shepherdsons -- not a one STOP And there ai n't no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either STOP Why , that old man kep ' up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords , and come out winner STOP They was all a-horseback ; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile , and kep ' his horse before him to stop the bullets ; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man , and peppered away at him , and he peppered away at them STOP Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled , but the Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ home -- and one of 'em was dead , and another died the next day STOP No , sir ; if a body 's out hunting for cowards he do n't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons , becuz they do n't breed any of that _kind_ STOP Next Sunday we all went to church , about three mile , everybody a-horseback STOP The men took their guns along , so did Buck , and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall STOP The Shepherdsons done the same STOP It was pretty ornery preaching -- all about brotherly love , and such-like tiresomeness ; but everybody said it was a good sermon , and they all talked it over going home , and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination , and I do n't know what all , that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet STOP About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around , some in their chairs and some in their rooms , and it got to be pretty dull STOP Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep STOP I went up to our room , and judged I would take a nap myself STOP I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door , which was next to ours , and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft , and asked me if I liked her , and I said I did ; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody , and I said I would STOP Then she said she 'd forgot her Testament , and left it in the seat at church between two other books , and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her , and not say nothing to nobody STOP I said I would STOP So I slid out and slipped off up the road , and there war n't anybody at the church , except maybe a hog or two , for there war n't any lock on the door , and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it 's cool STOP If you notice , most folks do n't go to church only when they 've got to ; but a hog is different STOP Says I to myself , something 's up ; it ai n't natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament STOP So I give it a shake , and out drops a little piece of paper with HALF-PAST TWO wrote on it with a pencil STOP I ransacked it , but could n't find anything else STOP I could n't make anything out of that , so I put the paper in the book again , and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me STOP She pulled me in and shut the door ; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper , and as soon as she read it she looked glad ; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze , and said I was the best boy in the world , and not to tell anybody STOP She was mighty red in the face for a minute , and her eyes lighted up , and it made her powerful pretty STOP I was a good deal astonished , but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about , and she asked me if I had read it , and I said no , and she asked me if I could read writing , and I told her no , only coarse-hand , and then she said the paper war n't anything but a book-mark to keep her place , and I might go and play now STOP I went off down to the river , studying over this thing , and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind STOP When we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second , and then comes a-running , and says : Mars Jawge , if you 'll come down into de swamp I 'll show you a whole stack o ' water-moccasins STOP Thinks I , that 's mighty curious ; he said that yesterday STOP He oughter know a body do n't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for them STOP What is he up to , anyway STOP So I says : All right ; trot ahead STOP I followed a half a mile ; then he struck out over the swamp , and waded ankle deep as much as another half-mile STOP We come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines , and he says : You shove right in dah jist a few steps , Mars Jawge ; dah 's whah dey is STOP I 's seed 'm befo ' ; I do n't k'yer to see 'em no mo ' STOP Then he slopped right along and went away , and pretty soon the trees hid him STOP I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines , and found a man laying there asleep -- and , by jings , it was my old Jim STOP I waked him up , and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again , but it war n't STOP He nearly cried he was so glad , but he war n't surprised STOP Said he swum along behind me that night , and heard me yell every time , but das n't answer , because he did n't want nobody to pick _him_ up and take him into slavery again STOP Says he : I got hurt a little , en could n't swim fas ' , so I wuz a considable ways behine you towards de las ' ;

but maybe it was luckier I did n't STOP There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store , cussing and yelling , and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing ; but they could n't come it STOP Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at STOP The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile , so they could watch both ways STOP By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling STOP They started riding towards the store ; then up gets one of the boys , draws a steady bead over the wood-rank , and drops one of them out of his saddle STOP All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store ; and that minute the two boys started on the run STOP They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed STOP Then the men see them , and jumped on their horses and took out after them STOP They gained on the boys , but it did n't do no good , the boys had too good a start ; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree , and slipped in behind it , and so they had the bulge on the men again STOP One of the boys was Buck , and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old STOP The men ripped around awhile , and then rode away STOP As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him STOP He did n't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first STOP He was awful surprised STOP He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again ; said they was up to some devilment or other -- would n't be gone long STOP I wished I was out of that tree , but I das n't come down STOP Buck begun to cry and rip , and 'lowed that him and his cousin Joe ( that was the other young chap ) would make up for this day yet STOP He said his father and his two brothers was killed , and two or three of the enemy STOP Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush STOP Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations -- the Shepherdsons was too strong for them STOP I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia STOP He said they 'd got across the river and was safe STOP I was glad of that ; but the way Buck did take on because he did n't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him -- I hai n't ever heard anything like it STOP All of a sudden , bang STOP bang STOP bang STOP goes three or four guns -- the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses STOP The boys jumped for the river -- both of them hurt -- and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out , Kill them , kill them STOP It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree STOP I ai n't a-going to tell _all_ that happened -- it would make me sick again if I was to do that STOP I wished I had n't ever come ashore that night to see such things STOP I ai n't ever going to get shut of them -- lots of times I dream about them STOP I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark , afraid to come down STOP Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods ; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns ; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on STOP I was mighty downhearted ; so I made up my mind I would n't ever go anear that house again , because I reckoned I was to blame , somehow STOP I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off ; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted , and then maybe he would a locked her up , and this awful mess would n't ever happened STOP When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece , and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water , and tugged at them till I got them ashore ; then I covered up their faces , and got away as quick as I could STOP I cried a little when I was covering up Buck 's face , for he was mighty good to me STOP It was just dark now STOP I never went near the house , but struck through the woods and made for the swamp STOP Jim war n't on his island , so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick , and crowded through the willows , red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country STOP The raft was gone STOP My souls , but I was scared STOP I could n't get my breath for most a minute STOP Then I raised a yell STOP A voice not twenty-five foot from me says : Good lan ' STOP is dat you , honey STOP Doan ' make no noise STOP It was Jim 's voice -- nothing ever sounded so good before STOP I run along the bank a piece and got aboard , and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me , he was so glad to see me STOP He says : Laws bless you , chile , I 'uz right down sho ' you 's dead agin STOP Jack's been heah ; he say he reck ' n you 's ben shot , kase you didn ' come home no mo ' ; so I 's jes ' dis minute a startin ' de raf ' down towards de mouf er de crick , so 's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead STOP Lawsy , I 's mighty glad to git you back again , honey STOP I says : All right -- that 's mighty good ; they wo n't find me , and they 'll think I 've been killed , and floated down the river -- there 's something up there that 'll help them think so -- so do n't you lose no time , Jim , but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can STOP I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi STOP Then we hung up our signal lantern , and judged that we was free and safe once more STOP I had n't had a bite to eat since yesterday , so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk , and pork and cabbage and greens -- there ai n't nothing in the world so good when it 's cooked right -- and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a good time STOP I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds , and so was Jim to get away from the swamp STOP We said there war n't no home like a raft , after all STOP Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery , but a raft do n't STOP You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft STOP STOP TWO or three days and nights went by ; I reckon I might say they swum by , they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely STOP Here is the way we put in the time STOP It was a monstrous big river down there -- sometimes a mile and a half wide ; we run nights , and laid up and hid daytimes ; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up -- nearly always in the dead water under a towhead ; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows , and hid the raft with them STOP Then we set out the lines STOP Next we slid into the river and had a swim , so as to freshen up and cool off ; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep , and watched the daylight come STOP Not a sound anywheres -- perfectly still -- just like the whole world was asleep , only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering , maybe STOP The first thing to see , looking away over the water , was a kind of dull line -- that was the woods on t'other side ; you could n't make nothing else out ; then a pale place in the sky ; then more paleness spreading around ; then the river softened up away off , and war n't black any more , but gray ; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away -- trading scows , and such things ; and long black streaks -- rafts ; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking ; or jumbled up voices , it was so still , and sounds come so far ; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there 's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way ; and you see the mist curl up off of the water , and the east reddens up , and the river , and you make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods , away on the bank on t'other side of the river , being a woodyard , likely , and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres ; then the nice breeze springs up , and comes fanning you from over there , so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers ; but sometimes not that way , because they 've left dead fish laying around , gars and such , and they do get pretty rank ; and next you 've got the full day , and everything smiling in the sun , and the song-birds just going it STOP A little smoke could n't be noticed now , so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast STOP And afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river , and kind of lazy along , and by and by lazy off to sleep STOP Wake up by and by , and look to see what done it , and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream , so far off towards the other side you could n't tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern-wheel or side-wheel ; then for about an hour there would n't be nothing to hear nor nothing to see -- just solid lonesomeness STOP Next you 'd see a raft sliding by , away off yonder , and maybe a galoot on it chopping , because they 're most always doing it on a raft ; you 'd see the axe flash and come down -- you do n't hear nothing ; you see that axe go up again , and by the time it 's above the man 's head then you hear the _k'chunk_ ! -- it had took all that time to come over the water STOP So we would put in the day , lazying around , listening to the stillness STOP Once there was a thick fog , and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats would n't run over them STOP A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing -- heard them plain ; but we could n't see no sign of them ; it made you feel crawly ; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air STOP Jim said he believed it was spirits ; but I says : No ; spirits would n't say , 'Dern the dern fog . STOP Soon as it was night out we shoved ; when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone , and let her float wherever the current wanted her to ; then we lit the pipes , and dangled our legs in the water , and talked about all kinds of things -- we was always naked , day and night , whenever the mosquitoes would let us -- the new clothes Buck 's folks made for me was too good to be comfortable , and besides I did n't go much on clothes , nohow STOP Sometimes we 'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time STOP Yonder was the banks and the islands , across the water ; and maybe a spark -- which was a candle in a cabin window ; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two -- on a raft or a scow , you know ; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts STOP It 's lovely to live on a raft STOP We had the sky up there , all speckled with stars , and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them , and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened STOP Jim he allowed they was made , but I allowed they happened ; I judged it would have took too long to _make_ so many STOP Jim said the moon could a _laid_ them ; well , that looked kind of reasonable , so I did n't say nothing against it , because I 've seen a frog lay most as many , so of course it could be done STOP We used to watch the stars that fell , too , and see them streak down STOP Jim allowed they 'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest STOP Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark , and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys , and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty ; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again ; and by and by her waves would get to us , a long time after she was gone , and joggle the raft a bit , and after that you would n't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how long , except maybe frogs or something STOP After midnight the people on shore went to bed , and then for two or three hours the shores was black -- no more sparks in the cabin windows STOP These sparks was our clock -- the first one that showed again meant morning was coming , so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away STOP One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore -- it was only two hundred yards -- and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods , to see if I could n't get some berries STOP Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick , here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it STOP I thought I was a goner , for whenever anybody was after anybody I judged it was _me_ -- or maybe Jim STOP I was about to dig out from there in a hurry , but they was pretty close to me then , and sung out and begged me to save their lives -- said they had n't been doing nothing , and was being chased for it -- said there was men and dogs a-coming STOP They wanted to jump right in , but I says : Do n't you do it STOP I do n't hear the dogs and horses yet ; you 've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways ; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in -- that 'll throw the dogs off the scent STOP They done it , and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead , and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off , shouting STOP We heard them come along towards the crick , but couldn't see them ; they seemed to stop and fool around a while ; then , as we got further and further away all the time , we could n't hardly hear them at all ; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river , everything was quiet , and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe STOP One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards , and had a bald head and very gray whiskers STOP He had an old battered-up slouch hat on , and a greasy blue woollen shirt , and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot-tops , and home-knit galluses -- no , he only had one STOP He had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm , and both of them had big , fat , ratty-looking carpet-bags STOP The other fellow was about thirty , and dressed about as ornery STOP After breakfast we all laid off and talked , and the first thing that come out was that these chaps did n't know one another STOP What got you into trouble STOP says the baldhead to t'other chap STOP Well , I 'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth -- and it does take it off , too , and generly the enamel along with it -- but I stayed about one night longer than I ought to , and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town , and you told me they were coming , and begged me to help you to get off STOP So I told you I was expecting trouble myself , and would scatter out _with_ you STOP That 's the whole yarn -- what 's yourn STOP Well , I 'd ben a-running ' a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week , and was the pet of the women folks , big and little , for I was makin ' it mighty warm for the rummies , I _tell_ you , and takin ' as much as five or six dollars a night -- ten cents a head , children and niggers free -- and business a-growin ' all the time , when somehow or another a little report got around last night that I had a way of puttin ' in my time with a private jug on the sly STOP A nigger rousted me out this mornin ' , and told me the people was getherin ' on the quiet with their dogs and horses , and they 'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour 's start , and then run me down if they could ; and if they got me they 'd tar and feather me and ride me on a rail , sure STOP I did n't wait for no breakfast -- I war n't hungry STOP Old man , said the young one , I reckon we might double-team it together ; what do you think STOP I ai n't undisposed STOP What 's your line -- mainly STOP Jour printer by trade ; do a little in patent medicines ; theater-actor -- tragedy , you know ; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there 's a chance ; teach singing-geography school for a change ; sling a lecture sometimes -- oh , I do lots of things -- most anything that comes handy , so it ai n't work STOP What 's your lay STOP I 've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time STOP Layin ' on o' hands is my best holt -- for cancer and paralysis , and sich things ; and I k ' n tell a fortune pretty good when I 've got somebody along to find out the facts for me STOP Preachin 's my line , too , and workin ' camp-meetin 's , and missionaryin ' around STOP Nobody never said anything for a while ; then the young man hove a sigh and says : Alas STOP What 're you alassin ' about STOP says the bald-head STOP To think I should have lived to be leading such a life , and be degraded down into such company STOP And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag STOP Dern your skin , ai n't the company good enough for you STOP says the baldhead , pretty pert and uppish STOP Yes , it _is_ good enough for me ; it 's as good as I deserve ; for who fetched me so low when I was so high STOP I did myself STOP I do n't blame _you_ , gentlemen -- far from it ; I do n't blame anybody STOP I deserve it all STOP Let the cold world do its worst ; one thing I know -- there 's a grave somewhere for me STOP The world may go on just as it 's always done , and take everything from me -- loved ones , property , everything ; but it ca n't take that STOP Some day I 'll lie down in it and forget it all , and my poor broken heart will be at rest STOP He went on a-wiping STOP Drot your pore broken heart , says the baldhead ; what are you heaving your pore broken heart at _us_ f ' r STOP _we_ hai n't done nothing STOP No , I know you have n't STOP I ai n't blaming you , gentlemen STOP I brought myself down -- yes , I did it myself STOP It 's right I should suffer -- perfectly right -- I do n't make any moan STOP Brought you down from whar STOP Whar was you brought down from STOP Ah , you would not believe me ; the world never believes -- let it pass -- 't is no matter STOP The secret of my birth -- The secret of your birth STOP Do you mean to say -- Gentlemen , says the young man , very solemn , I will reveal it to you , for I feel I may have confidence in you STOP By rights I am a duke STOP Jim 's eyes bugged out when he heard that ; and I reckon mine did , too STOP Then the baldhead says : No STOP you ca n't mean it STOP Yes STOP My great-grandfather , eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater , fled to this country about the end of the last century , to breathe the pure air of freedom ; married here , and died , leaving a son , his own father dying about the same time STOP The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates -- the infant real duke was ignored STOP I am the lineal descendant of that infant -- I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater ; and here am I , forlorn , torn from my high estate , hunted of men , despised by the cold world , ragged , worn , heart-broken , and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft STOP Jim pitied him ever so much , and so did I STOP We tried to comfort him , but he said it war n't much use , he could n't be much comforted ; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him , that would do him more good than most anything else ; so we said we would , if he would tell us how STOP He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him , and say Your Grace , or My Lord , or Your Lordship -- and he would n't mind it if we called him plain Bridgewater , which , he said , was a title anyway , and not a name ; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner , and do any little thing for him he wanted done STOP Well , that was all easy , so we done it STOP All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him , and says , Will yo ' Grace have some o ' dis or some o ' dat STOP and so on , and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him STOP But the old man got pretty silent by and by -- did n't have much to say , and did n't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke STOP He seemed to have something on his mind STOP So , along in the afternoon , he says : Looky here , Bilgewater , he says , I 'm nation sorry for you , but you ai n't the only person that 's had troubles like that STOP No STOP No you ai n't STOP You ai n't the only person that 's ben snaked down wrongfully out ' n a high place STOP Alas STOP No , you ai n't the only person that 's had a secret of his birth STOP And , by jings , _he_ begins to cry STOP Hold STOP What do you mean STOP Bilgewater , kin I trust you STOP says the old man , still sort of sobbing STOP To the bitter death STOP He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it , and says , That secret of your being : speak STOP Bilgewater , I am the late Dauphin STOP You bet you , Jim and me stared this time STOP Then the duke says : You are what STOP Yes , my friend , it is too true -- your eyes is lookin ' at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin , Looy the Seventeen , son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette STOP You STOP At your age STOP No STOP You mean you 're the late Charlemagne ; you must be six or seven hundred years old , at the very least STOP Trouble has done it , Bilgewater , trouble has done it ; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude STOP Yes , gentlemen , you see before you , in blue jeans and misery , the wanderin ' , exiled , trampled-on , and sufferin ' rightful King of France STOP Well , he cried and took on so that me and Jim did n't know hardly what to do , we was so sorry -- and so glad and proud we 'd got him with us , too STOP So we set in , like we done before with the duke , and tried to comfort _him_ STOP But he said it war n't no use , nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good ; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights , and got down on one knee to speak to him , and always called him Your Majesty , and waited on him first at meals , and did n't set down in his presence till he asked them STOP So Jim and me set to majestying him , and doing this and that and t'other for him , and standing up till he told us we might set down STOP This done him heaps of good , and so he got cheerful and comfortable STOP But the duke kind of soured on him , and did n't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going ; still , the king acted real friendly towards him , and said the duke's great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by _his_ father , and was allowed to come to the palace considerable ; but the duke stayed huffy a good while , till by and by the king says : Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft , Bilgewater , and so what 's the use o ' your bein ' sour STOP It 'll only make things oncomfortable STOP It ai n't my fault I war n't born a duke , it ai n't your fault you war n't born a king -- so what 's the use to worry STOP Make the best o ' things the way you find 'em , says I -- that 's my motto STOP This ai n't no bad thing that we 've struck here -- plenty grub and an easy life -- come , give us your hand , duke , and le 's all be friends STOP The duke done it , and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it STOP It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it , because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft ; for what you want , above all things , on a raft , is for everybody to be satisfied , and feel right and kind towards the others STOP It did n't take me long to make up my mind that these liars war n't no kings nor dukes at all , but just low-down humbugs and frauds STOP But I never said nothing , never let on ; kept it to myself ; it 's the best way ; then you do n't have no quarrels , and do n't get into no trouble STOP If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes , I had n't no objections , 'long as it would keep peace in the family ; and it war n't no use to tell Jim , so I did n't tell him STOP If I never learnt nothing else out of pap , I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way STOP STOP THEY asked us considerable many questions ; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for , and laid by in the daytime instead of running -- was Jim a runaway nigger STOP Says I : Goodness sakes STOP would a runaway nigger run _south_ STOP No , they allowed he would n't STOP I had to account for things some way , so I says : My folks was living in Pike County , in Missouri , where I was born , and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike STOP Pa , he 'lowed he 'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben , who 's got a little one-horse place on the river , forty-four mile below Orleans STOP Pa was pretty poor , and had some debts ; so when he 'd squared up there warn't nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger , Jim STOP That warn't enough to take us fourteen hundred mile , deck passage nor no other way STOP Well , when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day ; he ketched this piece of a raft ; so we reckoned we 'd go down to Orleans on it STOP Pa 's luck did n't hold out ; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night , and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel ; Jim and me come up all right , but pa was drunk , and Ike was only four years old , so they never come up no more STOP Well , for the next day or two we had considerable trouble , because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me , saying they believed he was a runaway nigger STOP We do n't run daytimes no more now ; nights they don't bother us STOP The duke says : Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to STOP I 'll think the thing over -- I 'll invent a plan that 'll fix it STOP We 'll let it alone for to-day , because of course we do n't want to go by that town yonder in daylight -- it might n't be healthy STOP Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain ; the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky , and the leaves was beginning to shiver -- it was going to be pretty ugly , it was easy to see that STOP So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam , to see what the beds was like STOP My bed was a straw tick better than Jim 's , which was a corn-shuck tick ; there 's always cobs around about in a shuck tick , and they poke into you and hurt ; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves ; it makes such a rustling that you wake up STOP Well , the duke allowed he would take my bed ; but the king allowed he would n't STOP He says : I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn-shuck bed war n't just fitten for me to sleep on STOP Your Grace 'll take the shuck bed yourself STOP Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute , being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them ; so we was pretty glad when the duke says : 'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression STOP Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit ; I yield , I submit ; 't is my fate STOP I am alone in the world -- let me suffer ; can bear it STOP We got away as soon as it was good and dark STOP The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river , and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town STOP We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by -- that was the town , you know -- and slid by , about a half a mile out , all right STOP When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern ; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything ; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better ; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night STOP It was my watch below till twelve , but I would n't a turned in anyway if I 'd had a bed , because a body do n't see such a storm as that every day in the week , not by a long sight STOP My souls , how the wind did scream along STOP And every second or two there 'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around , and you 'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain , and the trees thrashing around in the wind ; then comes a H-WHACK ! -- bum STOP bum STOP bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum -- and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away , and quit -- and then RIP comes another flash and another sockdolager STOP The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes , but I had n't any clothes on , and did n't mind STOP We did n't have no trouble about snags ; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them STOP I had the middle watch , you know , but I was pretty sleepy by that time , so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me ; he was always mighty good that way , Jim was STOP I crawled into the wigwam , but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there war n't no show for me ; so I laid outside -- I did n't mind the rain , because it was warm , and the waves war n't running so high now STOP About two they come up again , though , and Jim was going to call me ; but he changed his mind , because he reckoned they war n't high enough yet to do any harm ; but he was mistaken about that , for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard STOP It most killed Jim a-laughing STOP He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was , anyway STOP I took the watch , and Jim he laid down and snored away ; and by and by the storm let up for good and all ; and the first cabin-light that showed I rousted him out , and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day STOP The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast , and him and the duke played seven-up a while , five cents a game STOP Then they got tired of it , and allowed they would lay out a campaign , as they called it STOP The duke went down into his carpet-bag , and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud STOP One bill said , The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban , of Paris , would lecture on the Science of Phrenology at such and such a place , on the blank day of blank , at ten cents admission , and furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece STOP The duke said that was _him_ STOP In another bill he was the world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian , Garrick the Younger , of Drury Lane , London STOP In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things , like finding water and gold with a divining-rod , dissipating witch spells , and so on STOP By and by he says : But the histrionic muse is the darling STOP Have you ever trod the boards , Royalty STOP No , says the king STOP You shall , then , before you 're three days older , Fallen Grandeur , says the duke STOP The first good town we come to we 'll hire a hall and do the sword fight in Richard III STOP and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet STOP How does that strike you STOP I 'm in , up to the hub , for anything that will pay , Bilgewater ; but , you see , I do n't know nothing about play-actin ' , and hai n't ever seen much of it STOP I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace STOP Do you reckon you can learn me STOP Easy STOP All right STOP I 'm jist a-freezn ' for something fresh , anyway STOP Le's commence right away STOP So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was , and said he was used to being Romeo , so the king could be Juliet STOP But if Juliet 's such a young gal , duke , my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin ' to look oncommon odd on her , maybe STOP No , do n't you worry ; these country jakes wo n't ever think of that STOP Besides , you know , you 'll be in costume , and that makes all the difference in the world ; Juliet 's in a balcony , enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed , and she 's got on her night-gown and her ruffled nightcap STOP Here are the costumes for the parts STOP He got out two or three curtain-calico suits , which he said was meedyevil armor for Richard III STOP and t'other chap , and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match STOP The king was satisfied ; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spread-eagle way , prancing around and acting at the same time , to show how it had got to be done ; then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart STOP There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend , and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim ; so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing STOP The king allowed he would go , too , and see if he could n't strike something STOP We was out of coffee , so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some STOP When we got there there war n't nobody stirring ; streets empty , and perfectly dead and still , like Sunday STOP We found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard , and he said everybody that war n't too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting , about two mile back in the woods STOP The king got the directions , and allowed he 'd go and work that camp-meeting for all it was worth , and I might go , too STOP The duke said what he was after was a printing-office STOP We found it ; a little bit of a concern , up over a carpenter shop -- carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting , and no doors locked STOP It was a dirty , littered-up place , and had ink marks , and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them , all over the walls STOP The duke shed his coat and said he was all right now STOP So me and the king lit out for the camp-meeting STOP We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping , for it was a most awful hot day STOP There was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around STOP The woods was full of teams and wagons , hitched everywheres , feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep off the flies STOP There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches , where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell , and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck STOP The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds , only they was bigger and held crowds of people STOP The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs , with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs STOP They did n't have no backs STOP The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds STOP The women had on sun-bonnets ; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks , some gingham ones , and a few of the young ones had on calico STOP Some of the young men was barefooted , and some of the children did n't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt STOP Some of the old women was knitting , and some of the young folks was courting on the sly STOP The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn STOP He lined out two lines , everybody sung it , and it was kind of grand to hear it , there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way ; then he lined out two more for them to sing -- and so on STOP The people woke up more and more , and sung louder and louder ; and towards the end some begun to groan , and some begun to shout STOP Then the preacher begun to preach , and begun in earnest , too ; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other , and then a-leaning down over the front of it , with his arms and his body going all the time , and shouting his words out with all his might ; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and spread it open , and kind of pass it around this way and that , shouting , It 's the brazen serpent in the wilderness STOP Look upon it and live STOP And people would shout out , Glory ! -- A-a-_men_ STOP And so he went on , and the people groaning and crying and saying amen : Oh , come to the mourners ' bench STOP come , black with sin STOP ( _Amen_ ! STOP come , sick and sore STOP ( _Amen_ ! STOP come , lame and halt and blind STOP ( _Amen_ ! STOP come , pore and needy , sunk in shame STOP ( _A-A-Men_ ! STOP come , all that 's worn and soiled and suffering ! -- come with a broken spirit STOP come with a contrite heart STOP come in your rags and sin and dirt STOP the waters that cleanse is free , the door of heaven stands open -- oh , enter in and be at rest STOP ( _A-A-Men_ STOP _Glory , Glory Hallelujah ! _ ) And so on STOP You could n't make out what the preacher said any more , on account of the shouting and crying STOP Folks got up everywheres in the crowd , and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners' bench , with the tears running down their faces ; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd , they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw , just crazy and wild STOP Well , the first I knowed the king got a-going , and you could hear him over everybody ; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform , and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people , and he done it STOP He told them he was a pirate -- been a pirate for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean -- and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight , and he was home now to take out some fresh men , and thanks to goodness he 'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent , and he was glad of it ; it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him , because he was a changed man now , and happy for the first time in his life ; and , poor as he was , he was going to start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean , and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path ; for he could do it better than anybody else , being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean ; and though it would take him a long time to get there without money , he would get there anyway , and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him , Do n't you thank me , do n't you give me no credit ; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting , natural brothers and benefactors of the race , and that dear preacher there , the truest friend a pirate ever had STOP And then he busted into tears , and so did everybody STOP Then somebody sings out , Take up a collection for him , take up a collection STOP Well , a half a dozen made a jump to do it , but somebody sings out , Let _him_ pass the hat around STOP Then everybody said it , the preacher too STOP So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes , and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there ; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls , with the tears running down their cheeks , would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by ; and he always done it ; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times -- and he was invited to stay a week ; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses , and said they 'd think it was an honor ; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he could n't do no good , and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates STOP When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents STOP And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky , too , that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods STOP The king said , take it all around , it laid over any day he 'd ever put in in the missionarying line STOP He said it war n't no use talking , heathens don't amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with STOP The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king come to show up , but after that he did n't think so so much STOP He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office -- horse bills -- and took the money , four dollars STOP And he had got in ten dollars ' worth of advertisements for the paper , which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance -- so they done it STOP The price of the paper was two dollars a year , but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance ; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual , but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it , and was going to run it for cash STOP He set up a little piece of poetry , which he made , himself , out of his own head -- three verses -- kind of sweet and saddish -- the name of it was , Yes , crush , cold world , this breaking heart -- and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper , and did n't charge nothing for it STOP Well , he took in nine dollars and a half , and said he 'd done a pretty square day 's work for it STOP Then he showed us another little job he 'd printed and had n't charged for , because it was for us STOP It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder , and $ 200 reward under it STOP The reading was all about Jim , and just described him to a dot STOP It said he run away from St. Jacques ' plantation , forty mile below New Orleans , last winter , and likely went north , and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses STOP Now , says the duke , after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to STOP Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope , and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river , and were too poor to travel on a steamboat , so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward STOP Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim , but it would n't go well with the story of us being so poor STOP Too much like jewelry STOP Ropes are the correct thing -- we must preserve the unities , as we say on the boards STOP We all said the duke was pretty smart , and there could n't be no trouble about running daytimes STOP We judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke 's work in the printing office was going to make in that little town ; then we could boom right along if we wanted to STOP We laid low and kept still , and never shoved out till nearly ten o'clock ; then we slid by , pretty wide away from the town , and didn't hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it STOP When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning , he says : Huck , does you reck ' n we gwyne to run acrost any mo ' kings on dis trip STOP No , I says , I reckon not STOP Well , says he , dat 's all right , den STOP I doan ' mine one er two kings , but dat 's enough STOP Dis one 's powerful drunk , en de duke ain ' much better STOP I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French , so he could hear what it was like ; but he said he had been in this country so long , and had so much trouble , he 'd forgot it STOP STOP IT was after sun-up now , but we went right on and did n't tie up STOP The king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty ; but after they 'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal STOP After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft , and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches , and let his legs dangle in the water , so as to be comfortable , and lit his pipe , and went to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart STOP When he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together STOP The duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech ; and he made him sigh , and put his hand on his heart , and after a while he said he done it pretty well ; only , he says , you must n't bellow out _Romeo_ STOP that way , like a bull -- you must say it soft and sick and languishy , so -- R-o-o-meo STOP that is the idea ; for Juliet 's a dear sweet mere child of a girl , you know , and she does n't bray like a jackass STOP Well , next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths , and begun to practice the sword fight -- the duke called himself Richard III STOP ; and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see STOP But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard , and after that they took a rest , and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they 'd had in other times along the river STOP After dinner the duke says : Well , Capet , we 'll want to make this a first-class show , you know , so I guess we 'll add a little more to it STOP We want a little something to answer encores with , anyway STOP What 's onkores , Bilgewater STOP The duke told him , and then says : I 'll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor 's hornpipe ; and you -- well , let me see -- oh , I 've got it -- you can do Hamlet 's soliloquy STOP Hamlet 's which STOP Hamlet 's soliloquy , you know ; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare STOP Ah , it 's sublime , sublime STOP Always fetches the house STOP I have n't got it in the book -- I 've only got one volume -- but I reckon I can piece it out from memory STOP I 'll just walk up and down a minute , and see if I can call it back from recollection 's vaults STOP So he went to marching up and down , thinking , and frowning horrible every now and then ; then he would hoist up his eyebrows ; next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan ; next he would sigh , and next he 'd let on to drop a tear STOP It was beautiful to see him STOP By and by he got it STOP He told us to give attention STOP Then he strikes a most noble attitude , with one leg shoved forwards , and his arms stretched away up , and his head tilted back , looking up at the sky ; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth ; and after that , all through his speech , he howled , and spread around , and swelled up his chest , and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before STOP This is the speech -- I learned it , easy enough , while he was learning it to the king : To be , or not to be ; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of so long life ; For who would fardels bear , till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane , But that the fear of something after death Murders the innocent sleep , Great nature 's second course , And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of STOP There 's the respect must give us pause : Wake Duncan with thy knocking STOP I would thou couldst ; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , The oppressor 's wrong , the proud man 's contumely , The law 's delay , and the quietus which his pangs might take STOP In the dead waste and middle of the night , when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black , But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns , Breathes forth contagion on the world , And thus the native hue of resolution , like the poor cat i ' the adage , Is sicklied o'er with care STOP And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops , With this regard their currents turn awry , And lose the name of action STOP 'T is a consummation devoutly to be wished STOP But soft you , the fair Ophelia : Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws STOP But get thee to a nunnery & mdash ; go STOP Well , the old man he liked that speech , and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first rate STOP It seemed like he was just born for it ; and when he had his hand in and was excited , it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off STOP The first chance we got , the duke he had some show bills printed ; and after that , for two or three days as we floated along , the raft was a most uncommon lively place , for there war n't nothing but sword-fighting and rehearsing -- as the duke called it -- going on all the time STOP One morning , when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw , we come in sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend ; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it , in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees , and all of us but Jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show STOP We struck it mighty lucky ; there was going to be a circus there that afternoon , and the country people was already beginning to come in , in all kinds of old shackly wagons , and on horses STOP The circus would leave before night , so our show would have a pretty good chance STOP The duke he hired the court house , and we went around and stuck up our bills STOP They read like this : Shaksperean Revival ! ! STOP Wonderful Attraction STOP For One Night Only STOP The world renowned tragedians , David Garrick the younger , of Drury Lane Theatre , London , and Edmund Kean the elder , of the Royal Haymarket Theatre , Whitechapel , Pudding Lane , Piccadilly , London , and the Royal Continental Theatres , in their sublime Shaksperean Spectacle entitled The Balcony Scene in Romeo and Juliet ! !

STOP By the Illustrious Kean STOP Done by him 300 consecutive nights in Paris STOP For One Night Only , On account of imperative European engagements STOP Admission 25 cents ; children and servants , 10 cents STOP Then we went loafing around the town STOP The stores and houses was most all old shackly dried-up frame concerns that had n't ever been painted ; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts , so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed STOP The houses had little gardens around them , but they did n't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds , and sunflowers , and ash-piles , and old curled-up boots and shoes , and pieces of bottles , and rags , and played-out tin-ware STOP The fences was made of different kinds of boards , nailed on at different times ; and they leaned every which-way , and had gates that did n't generly have but one hinge -- a leather one STOP Some of the fences had been whitewashed , some time or another , but the duke said it was in Clumbus 's time , like enough STOP There was generly hogs in the garden , and people driving them out STOP All the stores was along one street STOP They had white domestic awnings in front , and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts STOP There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings , and loafers roosting on them all day long , whittling them with their Barlow knives ; and chawing tobacco , and gaping and yawning and stretching -- a mighty ornery lot STOP They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella , but did n't wear no coats nor waistcoats , they called one another Bill , and Buck , and Hank , and Joe , and Andy , and talked lazy and drawly , and used considerable many cuss words STOP There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post , and he most always had his hands in his britches-pockets , except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch STOP What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was : Gim me a chaw ' v tobacker , Hank STOP Cai n't ; I hai n't got but one chaw left STOP Ask Bill STOP Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw ; maybe he lies and says he ai n't got none STOP Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world , nor a chaw of tobacco of their own STOP They get all their chawing by borrowing ; they say to a fellow , I wisht you 'd len ' me a chaw , Jack , I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had -- which is a lie pretty much everytime ; it do n't fool nobody but a stranger ; but Jack ai n't no stranger , so he says : _You_ give him a chaw , did you STOP So did your sister 's cat's grandmother STOP You pay me back the chaws you 've awready borry 'd off ' n me , Lafe Buckner , then I 'll loan you one or two ton of it , and wo n't charge you no back intrust , nuther STOP Well , I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst STOP Yes , you did -- 'bout six chaws STOP You borry 'd store tobacker and paid back nigger-head STOP Store tobacco is flat black plug , but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted STOP When they borrow a chaw they do n't generly cut it off with a knife , but set the plug in between their teeth , and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two ; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it 's handed back , and says , sarcastic : Here , gim me the _chaw_ , and you take the _plug_ STOP All the streets and lanes was just mud ; they war n't nothing else _but_ mud -- mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places , and two or three inches deep in _all_ the places STOP The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres STOP You 'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way , where folks had to walk around her , and she 'd stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her , and look as happy as if she was on salary STOP And pretty soon you 'd hear a loafer sing out , Hi STOP _so_ boy STOP sick him , Tige STOP and away the sow would go , squealing most horrible , with a dog or two swinging to each ear , and three or four dozen more a-coming ; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight , and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise STOP Then they 'd settle back again till there was a dog fight STOP There could n't anything wake them up all over , and make them happy all over , like a dog fight -- unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him , or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death STOP On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank , and they was bowed and bent , and about ready to tumble in STOP The people had moved out of them STOP The bank was caved away under one corner of some others , and that corner was hanging over STOP People lived in them yet , but it was dangersome , because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time STOP Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer STOP Such a town as that has to be always moving back , and back , and back , because the river 's always gnawing at it STOP The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets , and more coming all the time STOP Families fetched their dinners with them from the country , and eat them in the wagons STOP There was considerable whisky drinking going on , and I seen three fights STOP By and by somebody sings out : Here comes old Boggs ! -- in from the country for his little old monthly drunk ; here he comes , boys STOP All the loafers looked glad ; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs STOP One of them says : Wonder who he 's a-gwyne to chaw up this time STOP If he 'd a-chawed up all the men he 's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he 'd have considerable ruputation now STOP Another one says , I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me , 'cuz then I 'd know I war n't gwyne to die for a thousan ' year STOP Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse , whooping and yelling like an Injun , and singing out : Cler the track , thar STOP I 'm on the waw-path , and the price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise STOP He was drunk , and weaving about in his saddle ; he was over fifty year old , and had a very red face STOP Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him , and he sassed back , and said he 'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns , but he could n't wait now because he 'd come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn , and his motto was , Meat first , and spoon vittles to top off on STOP He see me , and rode up and says : Whar 'd you come f 'm , boy STOP You prepared to die STOP Then he rode on STOP I was scared , but a man says : He do n't mean nothing ; he 's always a-carryin ' on like that when he's drunk STOP He 's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw -- never hurt nobody , drunk nor sober STOP Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town , and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells : Come out here , Sherburn STOP Come out and meet the man you 've swindled STOP You 're the houn ' I 'm after , and I 'm a-gwyne to have you , too STOP And so he went on , calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to , and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on STOP By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five -- and he was a heap the best dressed man in that town , too -- steps out of the store , and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come STOP He says to Boggs , mighty ca 'm and slow -- he says : I 'm tired of this , but I 'll endure it till one o'clock STOP Till one o'clock , mind -- no longer STOP If you open your mouth against me only once after that time you ca n't travel so far but I will find you STOP Then he turns and goes in STOP The crowd looked mighty sober ; nobody stirred , and there war n't no more laughing STOP Boggs rode off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell , all down the street ; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store , still keeping it up STOP Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up , but he would n't ; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes , and so he _must_ go home -- he must go right away STOP But it didn't do no good STOP He cussed away with all his might , and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it , and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again , with his gray hair a-flying STOP Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober ; but it war n't no use -- up the street he would tear again , and give Sherburn another cussing STOP By and by somebody says : Go for his daughter ! -- quick , go for his daughter ; sometimes he 'll listen to her STOP If anybody can persuade him , she can STOP So somebody started on a run STOP I walked down street a ways and stopped STOP In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again , but not on his horse STOP He was a-reeling across the street towards me , bare-headed , with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along STOP He was quiet , and looked uneasy ; and he war n't hanging back any , but was doing some of the hurrying himself STOP Somebody sings out : Boggs STOP I looked over there to see who said it , and it was that Colonel Sherburn STOP He was standing perfectly still in the street , and had a pistol raised in his right hand -- not aiming it , but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky STOP The same second I see a young girl coming on the run , and two men with her STOP Boggs and the men turned round to see who called him , and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side , and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level -- both barrels cocked STOP Boggs throws up both of his hands and says , O Lord , do n't shoot STOP Bang STOP goes the first shot , and he staggers back , clawing at the air -- bang STOP goes the second one , and he tumbles backwards on to the ground , heavy and solid , with his arms spread out STOP That young girl screamed out and comes rushing , and down she throws herself on her father , crying , and saying , Oh , he 's killed him , he 's killed him STOP The crowd closed up around them , and shouldered and jammed one another , with their necks stretched , trying to see , and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting , Back , back STOP give him air , give him air STOP Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground , and turned around on his heels and walked off STOP They took Boggs to a little drug store , the crowd pressing around just the same , and the whole town following , and I rushed and got a good place at the window , where I was close to him and could see in STOP They laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head , and opened another one and spread it on his breast ; but they tore open his shirt first , and I seen where one of the bullets went in STOP He made about a dozen long gasps , his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath , and letting it down again when he breathed it out -- and after that he laid still ; he was dead STOP Then they pulled his daughter away from him , screaming and crying , and took her off STOP She was about sixteen , and very sweet and gentle looking , but awful pale and scared STOP Well , pretty soon the whole town was there , squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look , but people that had the places would n't give them up , and folks behind them was saying all the time , Say , now , you 've looked enough , you fellows ; 'tai n't right and 'tai n't fair for you to stay thar all the time , and never give nobody a chance ; other folks has their rights as well as you STOP There was considerable jawing back , so I slid out , thinking maybe there was going to be trouble STOP The streets was full , and everybody was excited STOP Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened , and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows , stretching their necks and listening STOP One long , lanky man , with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head , and a crooked-handled cane , marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood , and the people following him around from one place to t'other and watching everything he done , and bobbing their heads to show they understood , and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane ; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood , frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes , and sung out , Boggs STOP and then fetched his cane down slow to a level , and says Bang STOP staggered backwards , says Bang STOP again , and fell down flat on his back STOP The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect ; said it was just exactly the way it all happened STOP Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him STOP Well , by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched STOP In about a minute everybody was saying it ; so away they went , mad and yelling , and snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with STOP STOP THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn 's house , a-whooping and raging like Injuns , and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush , and it was awful to see STOP Children was heeling it ahead of the mob , screaming and trying to get out of the way ; and every window along the road was full of women 's heads , and there was nigger boys in every tree , and bucks and wenches looking over every fence ; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach STOP Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on , scared most to death STOP They swarmed up in front of Sherburn 's palings as thick as they could jam together , and you could n't hear yourself think for the noise STOP It was a little twenty-foot yard STOP Some sung out Tear down the fence STOP tear down the fence STOP Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing , and down she goes , and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave STOP Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch , with a double-barrel gun in his hand , and takes his stand , perfectly ca 'm and deliberate , not saying a word STOP The racket stopped , and the wave sucked back STOP Sherburn never said a word -- just stood there , looking down STOP The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable STOP Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd ; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him , but they could n't ; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky STOP Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed ; not the pleasant kind , but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that 's got sand in it STOP Then he says , slow and scornful : The idea of _you_ lynching anybody STOP It 's amusing STOP The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_ STOP Because you 're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here , did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a _man_ STOP Why , a _man's_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind -- as long as it 's daytime and you 're not behind him STOP Do I know you STOP I know you clear through STOP I was born and raised in the South , and I 've lived in the North ; so I know the average all around STOP The average man 's a coward STOP In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to , and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it STOP In the South one man all by himself , has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime , and robbed the lot STOP Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people -- whereas you 're just _as_ brave , and no braver STOP Why do n't your juries hang murderers STOP Because they 're afraid the man 's friends will shoot them in the back , in the dark -- and it 's just what they _would_ do STOP So they always acquit ; and then a _man_ goes in the night , with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal STOP Your mistake is , that you did n't bring a man with you ; that 's one mistake , and the other is that you did n't come in the dark and fetch your masks STOP You brought _part_ of a man -- Buck Harkness , there -- and if you had n't had him to start you , you 'd a taken it out in blowing STOP You did n't want to come STOP The average man do n't like trouble and danger STOP _You_ do n't like trouble and danger STOP But if only _half_ a man -- like Buck Harkness , there -- shouts 'Lynch him STOP lynch him ! STOP you're afraid to back down -- afraid you 'll be found out to be what you are -- _cowards_ -- and so you raise a yell , and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man 's coat-tail , and come raging up here , swearing what big things you 're going to do STOP The pitifulest thing out is a mob ; that's what an army is -- a mob ; they do n't fight with courage that 's born in them , but with courage that 's borrowed from their mass , and from their officers STOP But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_ pitifulness STOP Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole STOP If any real lynching 's going to be done it will be done in the dark , Southern fashion ; and when they come they'll bring their masks , and fetch a _man_ along STOP Now _leave_ -- and take your half-a-man with you -- tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this STOP The crowd washed back sudden , and then broke all apart , and went tearing off every which way , and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them , looking tolerable cheap STOP I could a stayed if I wanted to , but I did n't want to STOP I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by , and then dived in under the tent STOP I had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money , but I reckoned I better save it , because there ai n't no telling how soon you are going to need it , away from home and amongst strangers that way STOP You ca n't be too careful STOP I ain't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ai n't no other way , but there ai n't no use in _wasting_ it on them STOP It was a real bully circus STOP It was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in , two and two , a gentleman and lady , side by side , the men just in their drawers and undershirts , and no shoes nor stirrups , and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable -- there must a been twenty of them -- and every lady with a lovely complexion , and perfectly beautiful , and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens , and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars , and just littered with diamonds STOP It was a powerful fine sight ; I never see anything so lovely STOP And then one by one they got up and stood , and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful , the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight , with their heads bobbing and skimming along , away up there under the tent-roof , and every lady 's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips , and she looking like the most loveliest parasol STOP And then faster and faster they went , all of them dancing , first one foot out in the air and then the other , the horses leaning more and more , and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole , cracking his whip and shouting Hi ! -- hi STOP and the clown cracking jokes behind him ; and by and by all hands dropped the reins , and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms , and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves STOP And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring , and made the sweetest bow I ever see , and then scampered out , and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild STOP Well , all through the circus they done the most astonishing things ; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people STOP The ringmaster could n't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said ; and how he ever _could_ think of so many of them , and so sudden and so pat , was what I could n't noway understand STOP Why , I could n't a thought of them in a year STOP And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring -- said he wanted to ride ; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was STOP They argued and tried to keep him out , but he would n't listen , and the whole show come to a standstill STOP Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him , and that made him mad , and he begun to rip and tear ; so that stirred up the people , and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring , saying , Knock him down STOP throw him out STOP and one or two women begun to scream STOP So , then , the ringmaster he made a little speech , and said he hoped there would n't be no disturbance , and if the man would promise he would n't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse STOP So everybody laughed and said all right , and the man got on STOP The minute he was on , the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around , with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him , and the drunk man hanging on to his neck , and his heels flying in the air every jump , and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down STOP And at last , sure enough , all the circus men could do , the horse broke loose , and away he went like the very nation , round and round the ring , with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck , with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side , and then t'other one on t'other side , and the people just crazy STOP It war n't funny to me , though ; I was all of a tremble to see his danger STOP But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle , a-reeling this way and that ; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood STOP and the horse a-going like a house afire too STOP He just stood up there , a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he war n't ever drunk in his life -- and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them STOP He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air , and altogether he shed seventeen suits STOP And , then , there he was , slim and handsome , and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw , and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum -- and finally skipped off , and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room , and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment STOP Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled , and he _was_ the sickest ringmaster you ever see , I reckon STOP Why , it was one of his own men STOP He had got up that joke all out of his own head , and never let on to nobody STOP Well , I felt sheepish enough to be took in so , but I wouldn't a been in that ringmaster 's place , not for a thousand dollars STOP I don't know ; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was , but I never struck them yet STOP Anyways , it was plenty good enough for _me_ ; and wherever I run across it , it can have all of _my_ custom every time STOP Well , that night we had _our_ show ; but there war n't only about twelve people there -- just enough to pay expenses STOP And they laughed all the time , and that made the duke mad ; and everybody left , anyway , before the show was over , but one boy which was asleep STOP So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads could n't come up to Shakespeare ; what they wanted was low comedy -- and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy , he reckoned STOP He said he could size their style STOP So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint , and drawed off some handbills , and stuck them up all over the village STOP The bills said : STOP WELL , all day him and the king was hard at it , rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights ; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time STOP When the place could n't hold no more , the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech , and praised up this tragedy , and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was ; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy , and about Edmund Kean the Elder , which was to play the main principal part in it ; and at last when he 'd got everybody 's expectations up high enough , he rolled up the curtain , and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on all fours , naked ; and he was painted all over , ring-streaked-and-striped , all sorts of colors , as splendid as a rainbow STOP And -- but never mind the rest of his outfit ; it was just wild , but it was awful funny STOP The people most killed themselves laughing ; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes , they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again , and after that they made him do it another time STOP Well , it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut STOP Then the duke he lets the curtain down , and bows to the people , and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more , on accounts of pressing London engagements , where the seats is all sold already for it in Drury Lane ; and then he makes them another bow , and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them , he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it STOP Twenty people sings out : What , is it over STOP Is that _all_ STOP The duke says yes STOP Then there was a fine time STOP Everybody sings out , Sold STOP and rose up mad , and was a-going for that stage and them tragedians STOP But a big , fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts : Hold on STOP Just a word , gentlemen STOP They stopped to listen STOP We are sold -- mighty badly sold STOP But we do n't want to be the laughing stock of this whole town , I reckon , and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live STOP _No_ STOP What we want is to go out of here quiet , and talk this show up , and sell the _rest_ of the town STOP Then we 'll all be in the same boat STOP Ai n't that sensible STOP ( You bet it is ! -- the jedge is right STOP everybody sings out . STOP All right , then -- not a word about any sell STOP Go along home , and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy STOP Next day you could n't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was STOP House was jammed again that night , and we sold this crowd the same way STOP When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper ; and by and by , about midnight , they made Jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river , and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town STOP The third night the house was crammed again -- and they war n't new-comers this time , but people that was at the show the other two nights STOP I stood by the duke at the door , and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging , or something muffled up under his coat -- and I see it war n't no perfumery , neither , not by a long sight STOP I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel , and rotten cabbages , and such things ; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around , and I bet I do , there was sixty-four of them went in STOP I shoved in there for a minute , but it was too various for me ; I could n't stand it STOP Well , when the place could n't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute , and then he started around for the stage door , I after him ; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says : Walk fast now till you get away from the houses , and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you STOP I done it , and he done the same STOP We struck the raft at the same time , and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream , all dark and still , and edging towards the middle of the river , nobody saying a word STOP I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience , but nothing of the sort ; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam , and says : Well , how 'd the old thing pan out this time , duke STOP He had n't been up-town at all STOP We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village STOP Then we lit up and had a supper , and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they 'd served them people STOP The duke says : Greenhorns , flatheads STOP I knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in ; and I knew they 'd lay for us the third night , and consider it was _their_ turn now STOP Well , it _is_ their turn , and I 'd give something to know how much they 'd take for it STOP I _would_ just like to know how they 're putting in their opportunity STOP They can turn it into a picnic if they want to -- they brought plenty provisions STOP Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights STOP I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before STOP By and by , when they was asleep and snoring , Jim says : Do n't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on , Huck STOP No , I says , it do n't STOP Why do n't it , Huck STOP Well , it do n't , because it 's in the breed STOP I reckon they 're all alike STOP But , Huck , dese kings o ' ourn is reglar rapscallions ; dat 's jist what dey is ; dey 's reglar rapscallions STOP Well , that 's what I 'm a-saying ; all kings is mostly rapscallions , as fur as I can make out STOP Is dat so STOP You read about them once -- you 'll see STOP Look at Henry the Eight ; this ' n 's a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_ STOP And look at Charles Second , and Louis Fourteen , and Louis Fifteen , and James Second , and Edward Second , and Richard Third , and forty more ; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain STOP My , you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom STOP He _was_ a blossom STOP He used to marry a new wife every day , and chop off her head next morning STOP And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs STOP 'Fetch up Nell Gwynn , ' he says STOP They fetch her up STOP Next morning , 'Chop off her head !

STOP But then I says again , 'No , I reckon it ai n't him , or else he would n't be paddling up the river .

but he 's missed seeing his brother Peter die -- which he mayn't mind , nobody can tell as to that -- but his brother would a give anything in this world to see _him_ before he died ; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks ; had n't seen him since they was boys together -- and had n't ever seen his brother William at all -- that 's the deef and dumb one -- William ai n't more than thirty or thirty-five STOP Peter and George were the only ones that come out here ; George was the married brother ; him and his wife both died last year STOP Harvey and William 's the only ones that 's left now ; and , as I was saying , they have n't got here in time STOP Did anybody send 'em word STOP Oh , yes ; a month or two ago , when Peter was first took ; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he war n't going to get well this time STOP You see , he was pretty old , and George 's g'yirls was too young to be much company for him , except Mary Jane , the red-headed one ; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died , and did n't seem to care much to live STOP He most desperately wanted to see Harvey -- and William , too , for that matter -- because he was one of them kind that can't bear to make a will STOP He left a letter behind for Harvey , and said he'd told in it where his money was hid , and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George 's g'yirls would be all right -- for George did n't leave nothing STOP And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to STOP Why do you reckon Harvey do n't come STOP Wher ' does he live STOP Oh , he lives in England -- Sheffield -- preaches there -- has n't ever been in this country STOP He has n't had any too much time -- and besides he might n't a got the letter at all , you know STOP Too bad , too bad he could n't a lived to see his brothers , poor soul STOP You going to Orleans , you say STOP Yes , but that ai n't only a part of it STOP I 'm going in a ship , next Wednesday , for Ryo Janeero , where my uncle lives STOP It 's a pretty long journey STOP But it 'll be lovely ;

and Deacon Lot Hovey , and Ben Rucker , and Abner Shackleford , and Levi Bell , the lawyer ; and Dr. Robinson , and their wives , and the widow Bartley , and -- well , there 's a lot of them ; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with , and used to write about sometimes , when he wrote home ; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets here STOP Well , the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow STOP Blamed if he did n't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town , and all about the Wilkses ; and about Peter 's business -- which was a tanner ; and about George 's -- which was a carpenter ; and about Harvey 's -- which was a dissentering minister ; and so on , and so on STOP Then he says : What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for STOP Because she 's a big Orleans boat , and I was afeard she might n't stop there STOP When they 're deep they wo n't stop for a hail STOP A Cincinnati boat will , but this is a St. Louis one STOP Was Peter Wilks well off STOP Oh , yes , pretty well off STOP He had houses and land , and it 's reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers STOP When did you say he died STOP I did n't say , but it was last night STOP Funeral to-morrow , likely STOP Yes , 'bout the middle of the day STOP Well , it 's all terrible sad ;

but I never said nothing , of course STOP When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe , and then they set down on a log , and the king told him everything , just like the young fellow had said it -- every last word of it STOP And all the time he was a-doing it he tried to talk like an Englishman ; and he done it pretty well , too , for a slouch STOP I ca n't imitate him , and so I ai n't a-going to try to ; but he really done it pretty good STOP Then he says : How are you on the deef and dumb , Bilgewater STOP The duke said , leave him alone for that ; said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards STOP So then they waited for a steamboat STOP About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along , but they did n't come from high enough up the river ; but at last there was a big one , and they hailed her STOP She sent out her yawl , and we went aboard , and she was from Cincinnati ; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad , and gave us a cussing , and said they would n't land us STOP But the king was ca 'm STOP He says : If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl , a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em , ca n't it STOP So they softened down and said it was all right ; and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore STOP About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming , and when the king says : Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher ' Mr. Peter Wilks lives STOP they give a glance at one another , and nodded their heads , as much as to say , What d ' I tell you STOP Then one of them says , kind of soft and gentle : I 'm sorry sir , but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_ live yesterday evening STOP Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash , and fell up against the man , and put his chin on his shoulder , and cried down his back , and says : Alas , alas , our poor brother -- gone , and we never got to see him ; oh , it 's too , too hard STOP Then he turns around , blubbering , and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands , and blamed if he did n't drop a carpet-bag and bust out a-crying STOP If they war n't the beatenest lot , them two frauds , that ever I struck STOP Well , the men gathered around and sympathized with them , and said all sorts of kind things to them , and carried their carpet-bags up the hill for them , and let them lean on them and cry , and told the king all about his brother 's last moments , and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke , and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they 'd lost the twelve disciples STOP Well , if ever I struck anything like it , I 'm a nigger STOP It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race STOP STOP THE news was all over town in two minutes , and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way , some of them putting on their coats as they come STOP Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd , and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march STOP The windows and dooryards was full ; and every minute somebody would say , over a fence : Is it _them_ STOP And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say : You bet it is STOP When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed , and the three girls was standing in the door STOP Mary Jane _was_ red-headed , but that do n't make no difference , she was most awful beautiful , and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory , she was so glad her uncles was come STOP The king he spread his arms , and Mary Jane she jumped for them , and the hare-lip jumped for the duke , and there they had it STOP Everybody most , leastways women , cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times STOP Then the king he hunched the duke private -- I see him do it -- and then he looked around and see the coffin , over in the corner on two chairs ; so then him and the duke , with a hand across each other 's shoulder , and t'other hand to their eyes , walked slow and solemn over there , everybody dropping back to give them room , and all the talk and noise stopping , people saying Sh STOP and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads , so you could a heard a pin fall STOP And when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin , and took one sight , and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans , most ; and then they put their arms around each other 's necks , and hung their chins over each other 's shoulders ; and then for three minutes , or maybe four , I never see two men leak the way they done STOP And , mind you , everybody was doing the same ; and the place was that damp I never see anything like it STOP Then one of them got on one side of the coffin , and t'other on t'other side , and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin , and let on to pray all to themselves STOP Well , when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it , and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud -- the poor girls , too ; and every woman , nearly , went up to the girls , without saying a word , and kissed them , solemn , on the forehead , and then put their hand on their head , and looked up towards the sky , with the tears running down , and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing , and give the next woman a show STOP I never see anything so disgusting STOP Well , by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little , and works himself up and slobbers out a speech , all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased , and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile , but it 's a trial that 's sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears , and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother 's heart , because out of their mouths they ca n't , words being too weak and cold , and all that kind of rot and slush , till it was just sickening ; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen , and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust STOP And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer , and everybody joined in with all their might , and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out STOP Music is a good thing ; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never see it freshen up things so , and sound so honest and bully STOP Then the king begins to work his jaw again , and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening , and help set up with the ashes of the diseased ; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name , for they was names that was very dear to him , and mentioned often in his letters ; and so he will name the same , to wit , as follows , vizz . : -- Rev STOP Mr. Hobson , and Deacon Lot Hovey , and Mr. Ben Rucker , and Abner Shackleford , and Levi Bell , and Dr. Robinson , and their wives , and the widow Bartley STOP Rev STOP Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting together -- that is , I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other world , and the preacher was pinting him right STOP Lawyer Bell was away up to Louisville on business STOP But the rest was on hand , and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him ; and then they shook hands with the duke and did n't say nothing , but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said Goo-goo -- goo-goo-goo all the time , like a baby that ca n't talk STOP So the king he blattered along , and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town , by his name , and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town , or to George 's family , or to Peter STOP And he always let on that Peter wrote him the things ; but that was a lie : he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat STOP Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind , and the king he read it out loud and cried over it STOP It give the dwelling-house and three thousand dollars , gold , to the girls ; and it give the tanyard ( which was doing a good business ) , along with some other houses and land ( worth about seven thousand ) , and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William , and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar STOP So these two frauds said they 'd go and fetch it up , and have everything square and above-board ; and told me to come with a candle STOP We shut the cellar door behind us , and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor , and it was a lovely sight , all them yaller-boys STOP My , the way the king 's eyes did shine STOP He slaps the duke on the shoulder and says : Oh , _this_ ai n't bully nor noth ' n STOP Oh , no , I reckon not STOP Why , _bully_ , it beats the Nonesuch , _don't_ it STOP The duke allowed it did STOP They pawed the yaller-boys , and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor ; and the king says : It ai n't no use talkin ' ; bein ' brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that 's got left is the line for you and me , Bilge STOP Thish yer comes of trust ' n to Providence STOP It 's the best way , in the long run STOP I 've tried 'em all , and ther ' ai n't no better way STOP Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile , and took it on trust ; but no , they must count it STOP So they counts it , and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short STOP Says the king : Dern him , I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars STOP They worried over that awhile , and ransacked all around for it STOP Then the duke says : Well , he was a pretty sick man , and likely he made a mistake -- I reckon that 's the way of it STOP The best way 's to let it go , and keep still about it STOP We can spare it STOP Oh , shucks , yes , we can _spare_ it STOP I do n't k'yer noth ' n 'bout that -- it 's the _count_ I 'm thinkin ' about STOP We want to be awful square and open and above-board here , you know STOP We want to lug this h-yer money up stairs and count it before everybody -- then ther ' ai n't noth ' n suspicious STOP But when the dead man says ther 's six thous ' n dollars , you know , we do n't want to -- Hold on , says the duke STOP Le 's make up the deffisit , and he begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket STOP It 's a most amaz ' n ' good idea , duke -- you _have_ got a rattlin ' clever head on you , says the king STOP Blest if the old Nonesuch ai n't a heppin' us out agin , and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up STOP It most busted them , but they made up the six thousand clean and clear STOP Say , says the duke , I got another idea STOP Le 's go up stairs and count this money , and then take and _give it to the girls_ STOP Good land , duke , lem me hug you STOP It 's the most dazzling idea 'at ever a man struck STOP You have cert'nly got the most astonishin ' head I ever see STOP Oh , this is the boss dodge , ther ' ai n't no mistake 'bout it STOP Let 'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to -- this 'll lay 'em out STOP When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table , and the king he counted it and stacked it up , three hundred dollars in a pile -- twenty elegant little piles STOP Everybody looked hungry at it , and licked their chops STOP Then they raked it into the bag again , and I see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech STOP He says : Friends all , my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that 's left behind in the vale of sorrers STOP He has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered , and that 's left fatherless and motherless STOP Yes , and we that knowed him knows that he would a done _more_ generous by 'em if he had n't ben afeard o ' woundin' his dear William and me STOP Now , _wouldn't_ he STOP Ther ' ai n't no question 'bout it in _my_ mind STOP Well , then , what kind o ' brothers would it be that 'd stand in his way at sech a time STOP And what kind o ' uncles would it be that 'd rob -- yes , _rob_ -- sech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved so at sech a time STOP If I know William -- and I _think_ I do -- he -- well , I'll jest ask him STOP He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands , and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather-headed a while ; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning , and jumps for the king , goo-gooing with all his might for joy , and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up STOP Then the king says , I knowed it ; I reckon _that 'll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels about it STOP Here , Mary Jane , Susan , Joanner , take the money -- take it _all_ STOP It 's the gift of him that lays yonder , cold but joyful STOP Mary Jane she went for him , Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke , and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet STOP And everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes , and most shook the hands off of them frauds , saying all the time : You _dear_ good souls ! -- how _lovely_ ! -- how _could_ you STOP Well , then , pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again , and how good he was , and what a loss he was , and all that ; and before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside , and stood a-listening and looking , and not saying anything ; and nobody saying anything to him either , because the king was talking and they was all busy listening STOP The king was saying -- in the middle of something he'd started in on -- -- they bein ' partickler friends o ' the diseased STOP That 's why they're invited here this evenin ' ; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come -- everybody ; for he respected everybody , he liked everybody , and so it 's fitten that his funeral orgies sh 'd be public STOP And so he went a-mooning on and on , liking to hear himself talk , and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again , till the duke he could n't stand it no more ; so he writes on a little scrap of paper , _Obsequies_ , you old fool , and folds it up , and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people 's heads to him STOP The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket , and says : Poor William , afflicted as he is , his _heart's_ aluz right STOP Asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral -- wants me to make 'em all welcome STOP But he need n't a worried -- it was jest what I was at STOP Then he weaves along again , perfectly ca 'm , and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then , just like he done before STOP And when he done it the third time he says : I say orgies , not because it 's the common term , because it ai n't -- obsequies bein ' the common term -- but because orgies is the right term STOP Obsequies ai n't used in England no more now -- it 's gone out STOP We say orgies now in England STOP Orgies is better , because it means the thing you 're after more exact STOP It 's a word that 's made up out ' n the Greek _orgo_ , outside , open , abroad ; and the Hebrew _jeesum_ , to plant , cover up ; hence in_ter._ So , you see , funeral orgies is an open er public funeral STOP He was the _worst_ I ever struck STOP Well , the iron-jawed man he laughed right in his face STOP Everybody was shocked STOP Everybody says , Why , _doctor_ STOP and Abner Shackleford says : Why , Robinson , hai n't you heard the news STOP This is Harvey Wilks STOP The king he smiled eager , and shoved out his flapper , and says : Is it my poor brother 's dear good friend and physician STOP I -- Keep your hands off of me STOP says the doctor STOP _You_ talk like an Englishman , _don't_ you STOP It 's the worst imitation I ever heard STOP _You_ Peter Wilks 's brother STOP You 're a fraud , that 's what you are STOP Well , how they all took on STOP They crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down , and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey 'd showed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey , and knowed everybody by name , and the names of the very dogs , and begged and _begged_ him not to hurt Harvey 's feelings and the poor girl 's feelings , and all that STOP But it war n't no use ; he stormed right along , and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and could n't imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar STOP The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying ; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_ STOP He says : I was your father 's friend , and I 'm your friend ; and I warn you as a friend , and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble , to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him , the ignorant tramp , with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew , as he calls it STOP He is the thinnest kind of an impostor -- has come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres , and you take them for _proofs_ , and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here , who ought to know better STOP Mary Jane Wilks , you know me for your friend , and for your unselfish friend , too STOP Now listen to me ; turn this pitiful rascal out -- I _beg_ you to do it STOP Will you STOP Mary Jane straightened herself up , and my , but she was handsome STOP She says : _Here_ is my answer STOP She hove up the bag of money and put it in the king 's hands , and says , Take this six thousand dollars , and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to , and do n't give us no receipt for it STOP Then she put her arm around the king on one side , and Susan and the hare-lip done the same on the other STOP Everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm , whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud STOP The doctor says : All right ; I wash _my_ hands of the matter STOP But I warn you all that a time 's coming when you 're going to feel sick whenever you think of this day STOP And away he went STOP All right , doctor , says the king , kinder mocking him ; we 'll try and get 'em to send for you ; which made them all laugh , and they said it was a prime good hit STOP STOP WELL , when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off for spare rooms , and she said she had one spare room , which would do for Uncle William , and she 'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey , which was a little bigger , and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot ; and up garret was a little cubby , with a pallet in it STOP The king said the cubby would do for his valley -- meaning me STOP So Mary Jane took us up , and she showed them their rooms , which was plain but nice STOP She said she 'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey 's way , but he said they war n't STOP The frocks was hung along the wall , and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor STOP There was an old hair trunk in one corner , and a guitar-box in another , and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around , like girls brisken up a room with STOP The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings , and so do n't disturb them STOP The duke 's room was pretty small , but plenty good enough , and so was my cubby STOP That night they had a big supper , and all them men and women was there , and I stood behind the king and the duke 's chairs and waited on them , and the niggers waited on the rest STOP Mary Jane she set at the head of the table , with Susan alongside of her , and said how bad the biscuits was , and how mean the preserves was , and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was -- and all that kind of rot , the way women always do for to force out compliments ; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop , and said so -- said How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice STOP and Where , for the land 's sake , _did_ you get these amaz ' n pickles STOP and all that kind of humbug talky-talk , just the way people always does at a supper , you know STOP And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings , whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things STOP The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England , and blest if I did n't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes STOP She says : Did you ever see the king STOP Who STOP William Fourth STOP Well , I bet I have -- he goes to our church STOP I knowed he was dead years ago , but I never let on STOP So when I says he goes to our church , she says : What -- regular STOP Yes -- regular STOP His pew 's right over opposite ourn -- on t'other side the pulpit STOP I thought he lived in London STOP Well , he does STOP Where _would_ he live STOP But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield STOP I see I was up a stump STOP I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone , so as to get time to think how to get down again STOP Then I says : I mean he goes to our church regular when he 's in Sheffield STOP That's only in the summer time , when he comes there to take the sea baths STOP Why , how you talk -- Sheffield ai n't on the sea STOP Well , who said it was STOP Why , you did STOP I _didn't_ nuther STOP You did STOP I did n't STOP You did STOP I never said nothing of the kind STOP Well , what _did_ you say , then STOP Said he come to take the sea _baths_ -- that 's what I said STOP Well , then , how 's he going to take the sea baths if it ai n't on the sea STOP Looky here , I says ; did you ever see any Congress-water STOP Yes STOP Well , did you have to go to Congress to get it STOP Why , no STOP Well , neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath STOP How does he get it , then STOP Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water -- in barrels STOP There in the palace at Sheffield they 've got furnaces , and he wants his water hot STOP They ca n't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea STOP They have n't got no conveniences for it STOP Oh , I see , now STOP You might a said that in the first place and saved time STOP When she said that I see I was out of the woods again , and so I was comfortable and glad STOP Next , she says : Do you go to church , too STOP Yes -- regular STOP Where do you set STOP Why , in our pew STOP _Whose_ pew STOP Why , _ourn_ -- your Uncle Harvey 's STOP His ' n STOP What does _he_ want with a pew STOP Wants it to set in STOP What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it STOP Why , I thought he 'd be in the pulpit STOP Rot him , I forgot he was a preacher STOP I see I was up a stump again , so I played another chicken bone and got another think STOP Then I says : Blame it , do you suppose there ai n't but one preacher to a church STOP Why , what do they want with more STOP What ! -- to preach before a king STOP I never did see such a girl as you STOP They do n't have no less than seventeen STOP Seventeen STOP My land STOP Why , I would n't set out such a string as that , not if I _never_ got to glory STOP It must take 'em a week STOP Shucks , they do n't _all_ of 'em preach the same day -- only _one_ of 'em STOP Well , then , what does the rest of 'em do STOP Oh , nothing much STOP Loll around , pass the plate -- and one thing or another STOP But mainly they do n't do nothing STOP Well , then , what are they _for_ STOP Why , they 're for _style_ STOP Do n't you know nothing STOP Well , I do n't _want_ to know no such foolishness as that STOP How is servants treated in England STOP Do they treat 'em better ' n we treat our niggers STOP _No_ STOP A servant ai n't nobody there STOP They treat them worse than dogs STOP Do n't they give 'em holidays , the way we do , Christmas and New Year's week , and Fourth of July STOP Oh , just listen STOP A body could tell _you_ hai n't ever been to England by that STOP Why , Hare-l -- why , Joanna , they never see a holiday from year's end to year 's end ; never go to the circus , nor theater , nor nigger shows , nor nowheres STOP Nor church STOP Nor church STOP But _you_ always went to church STOP Well , I was gone up again STOP I forgot I was the old man 's servant STOP But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he wanted to or not , and set with the family , on account of its being the law STOP But I did n't do it pretty good , and when I got done I see she war n't satisfied STOP She says : Honest injun , now , hai n't you been telling me a lot of lies STOP Honest injun , says I STOP None of it at all STOP None of it at all STOP Not a lie in it , says I STOP Lay your hand on this book and say it STOP I see it war n't nothing but a dictionary , so I laid my hand on it and said it STOP So then she looked a little better satisfied , and says : Well , then , I 'll believe some of it ; but I hope to gracious if I'll believe the rest STOP What is it you wo n't believe , Joe STOP says Mary Jane , stepping in with Susan behind her STOP It ai n't right nor kind for you to talk so to him , and him a stranger and so far from his people STOP How would you like to be treated so STOP That 's always your way , Maim -- always sailing in to help somebody before they 're hurt STOP I hai n't done nothing to him STOP He 's told some stretchers , I reckon , and I said I would n't swallow it all ; and that 's every bit and grain I _did_ say STOP I reckon he can stand a little thing like that , ca n't he STOP I do n't care whether 't was little or whether 't was big ; he 's here in our house and a stranger , and it was n't good of you to say it STOP If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed ; and so you ought n't to say a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed STOP Why , Mam , he said -- It do n't make no difference what he _said_ -- that ai n't the thing STOP The thing is for you to treat him _kind_ , and not be saying things to make him remember he ai n't in his own country and amongst his own folks STOP I says to myself , _this_ is a girl that I 'm letting that old reptile rob her of her money STOP Then Susan _she_ waltzed in ; and if you 'll believe me , she did give Hare-lip hark from the tomb STOP Says I to myself , and this is _another_ one that I 'm letting him rob her of her money STOP Then Mary Jane she took another inning , and went in sweet and lovely again -- which was her way ; but when she got done there war n't hardly anything left o ' poor Hare-lip STOP So she hollered STOP All right , then , says the other girls ; you just ask his pardon STOP She done it , too ; and she done it beautiful STOP She done it so beautiful it was good to hear ; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies , so she could do it again STOP I says to myself , this is _another_ one that I 'm letting him rob her of her money STOP And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends STOP I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself , my mind 's made up ; I 'll hive that money for them or bust STOP So then I lit out -- for bed , I said , meaning some time or another STOP When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over STOP I says to myself , shall I go to that doctor , private , and blow on these frauds STOP No -- that wo n't do STOP He might tell who told him ; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me STOP Shall I go , private , and tell Mary Jane STOP No -- I das n't do it STOP Her face would give them a hint , sure ; they 've got the money , and they 'd slide right out and get away with it STOP If she was to fetch in help I 'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with , I judge STOP No ; there ai n't no good way but one STOP I got to steal that money , somehow ; and I got to steal it some way that they wo n't suspicion that I done it STOP They 've got a good thing here , and they ai n't a-going to leave till they 've played this family and this town for all they're worth , so I 'll find a chance time enough STOP I 'll steal it and hide it ; and by and by , when I 'm away down the river , I 'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it 's hid STOP But I better hive it tonight if I can , because the doctor maybe has n't let up as much as he lets on he has ; he might scare them out of here yet STOP So , thinks I , I 'll go and search them rooms STOP Upstairs the hall was dark , but I found the duke 's room , and started to paw around it with my hands ; but I recollected it would n't be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self ; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there STOP But I see I could n't do nothing without a candle , and I das n't light one , of course STOP So I judged I'd got to do the other thing -- lay for them and eavesdrop STOP About that time I hears their footsteps coming , and was going to skip under the bed ; I reached for it , but it was n't where I thought it would be ; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane 's frocks , so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns , and stood there perfectly still STOP They come in and shut the door ; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed STOP Then I was glad I had n't found the bed when I wanted it STOP And yet , you know , it 's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private STOP They sets down then , and the king says : Well , what is it STOP And cut it middlin ' short , because it 's better for us to be down there a-whoopin ' up the mournin ' than up here givin ' 'em a chance to talk us over STOP Well , this is it , Capet STOP I ai n't easy ; I ai n't comfortable STOP That doctor lays on my mind STOP I wanted to know your plans STOP I 've got a notion , and I think it 's a sound one STOP What is it , duke STOP That we better glide out of this before three in the morning , and clip it down the river with what we 've got STOP Specially , seeing we got it so easy -- _given_ back to us , flung at our heads , as you may say , when of course we allowed to have to steal it back STOP I 'm for knocking off and lighting out STOP That made me feel pretty bad STOP About an hour or two ago it would a been a little different , but now it made me feel bad and disappointed , The king rips out and says : What STOP And not sell out the rest o ' the property STOP March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous ' n ' dollars ' worth o' property layin ' around jest sufferin ' to be scooped in ? -- and all good , salable stuff , too STOP The duke he grumbled ; said the bag of gold was enough , and he didn't want to go no deeper -- did n't want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_ they had STOP Why , how you talk STOP says the king STOP We sha ' n't rob 'em of nothing at all but jest this money STOP The people that _buys_ the property is the suff'rers ; because as soon 's it 's found out 'at we did n't own it -- which wo n't be long after we 've slid -- the sale wo n't be valid , and it 'll all go back to the estate STOP These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin , and that 's enough for _them_ ; they 're young and spry , and k ' n easy earn a livin ' STOP _they_ ai n't a-goin to suffer STOP Why , jest think -- there's thous ' n 's and thous ' n 's that ai n't nigh so well off STOP Bless you , _they_ ai n't got noth ' n ' to complain of STOP Well , the king he talked him blind ; so at last he give in , and said all right , but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay , and that doctor hanging over them STOP But the king says : Cuss the doctor STOP What do we k'yer for _him_ STOP Hai n't we got all the fools in town on our side STOP And ai n't that a big enough majority in any town STOP So they got ready to go down stairs again STOP The duke says : I do n't think we put that money in a good place STOP That cheered me up STOP I 'd begun to think I war n't going to get a hint of no kind to help me STOP The king says : Why STOP Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out ; and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put 'em away ; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it STOP Your head 's level agin , duke , says the king ; and he comes a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was STOP I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still , though quivery ; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me ; and I tried to think what I 'd better do if they did catch me STOP But the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought , and he never suspicioned I was around STOP They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed , and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now , because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed , and do n't turn over the straw tick only about twice a year , and so it war n't in no danger of getting stole now STOP But I knowed better STOP I had it out of there before they was half-way down stairs STOP I groped along up to my cubby , and hid it there till I could get a chance to do better STOP I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres , because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking : I knowed that very well STOP Then I turned in , with my clothes all on ; but I could n't a gone to sleep if I 'd a wanted to , I was in such a sweat to get through with the business STOP By and by I heard the king and the duke come up ; so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder , and waited to see if anything was going to happen STOP But nothing did STOP So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't begun yet ; and then I slipped down the ladder STOP STOP I crept to their doors and listened ; they was snoring STOP So I tiptoed along , and got down stairs all right STOP There war n't a sound anywheres STOP I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door , and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs STOP The door was open into the parlor , where the corpse was laying , and there was a candle in both rooms STOP I passed along , and the parlor door was open ; but I see there war n't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter ; so I shoved on by ; but the front door was locked , and the key was n't there STOP Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs , back behind me STOP I run in the parlor and took a swift look around , and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin STOP The lid was shoved along about a foot , showing the dead man 's face down in there , with a wet cloth over it , and his shroud on STOP I tucked the money-bag in under the lid , just down beyond where his hands was crossed , which made me creep , they was so cold , and then I run back across the room and in behind the door STOP The person coming was Mary Jane STOP She went to the coffin , very soft , and kneeled down and looked in ; then she put up her handkerchief , and I see she begun to cry , though I could n't hear her , and her back was to me STOP I slid out , and as I passed the dining-room I thought I 'd make sure them watchers had n't seen me ; so I looked through the crack , and everything was all right STOP They had n't stirred STOP I slipped up to bed , feeling ruther blue , on accounts of the thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it STOP Says I , if it could stay where it is , all right ; because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane , and she could dig him up again and get it ; but that ai n't the thing that 's going to happen ; the thing that 's going to happen is , the money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid STOP Then the king 'll get it again , and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him STOP Of course I _wanted_ to slide down and get it out of there , but I das n't try it STOP Every minute it was getting earlier now , and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir , and I might get catched -- catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody had n't hired me to take care of STOP I do n't wish to be mixed up in no such business as that , I says to myself STOP When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up , and the watchers was gone STOP There war n't nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe STOP I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening , but I could n't tell STOP Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man , and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs , and then set all our chairs in rows , and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full STOP I see the coffin lid was the way it was before , but I das n't go to look in under it , with folks around STOP Then the people begun to flock in , and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin , and for a half an hour the people filed around slow , in single rank , and looked down at the dead man 's face a minute , and some dropped in a tear , and it was all very still and solemn , only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent , and sobbing a little STOP There war n't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses -- because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church STOP When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways , putting on the last touches , and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable , and making no more sound than a cat STOP He never spoke ; he moved people around , he squeezed in late ones , he opened up passageways , and done it with nods , and signs with his hands STOP Then he took his place over against the wall STOP He was the softest , glidingest , stealthiest man I ever see ; and there war n't no more smile to him than there is to a ham STOP They had borrowed a melodeum -- a sick one ; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it , and it was pretty skreeky and colicky , and everybody joined in and sung , and Peter was the only one that had a good thing , according to my notion STOP Then the Reverend Hobson opened up , slow and solemn , and begun to talk ; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard ; it was only one dog , but he made a most powerful racket , and he kept it up right along ; the parson he had to stand there , over the coffin , and wait -- you could n't hear yourself think STOP It was right down awkward , and nobody did n't seem to know what to do STOP But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say , Do n't you worry -- just depend on me STOP Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall , just his shoulders showing over the people's heads STOP So he glided along , and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time ; and at last , when he had gone around two sides of the room , he disappears down cellar STOP Then in about two seconds we heard a whack , and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two , and then everything was dead still , and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off STOP In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall again ; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room , and then rose up , and shaded his mouth with his hands , and stretched his neck out towards the preacher , over the people 's heads , and says , in a kind of a coarse whisper , _He had a rat_ STOP Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place STOP You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people , because naturally they wanted to know STOP A little thing like that don't cost nothing , and it 's just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked STOP There war n't no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was STOP Well , the funeral sermon was very good , but pison long and tiresome ; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage , and at last the job was through , and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw-driver STOP I was in a sweat then , and watched him pretty keen STOP But he never meddled at all ; just slid the lid along as soft as mush , and screwed it down tight and fast STOP So there I was STOP I did n't know whether the money was in there or not STOP So , says I , s'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly ? -- now how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not STOP S'pose she dug him up and did n't find nothing , what would she think of me STOP Blame it , I says , I might get hunted up and jailed ; I 'd better lay low and keep dark , and not write at all ; the thing 's awful mixed now ; trying to better it , I 've worsened it a hundred times , and I wish to goodness I 'd just let it alone , dad fetch the whole business STOP They buried him , and we come back home , and I went to watching faces again -- I could n't help it , and I could n't rest easy STOP But nothing come of it ; the faces did n't tell me nothing STOP The king he visited around in the evening , and sweetened everybody up , and made himself ever so friendly ; and he give out the idea that his congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him , so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home STOP He was very sorry he was so pushed , and so was everybody ; they wished he could stay longer , but they said they could see it could n't be done STOP And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them ; and that pleased everybody too , because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations ; and it pleased the girls , too -- tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world ; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to , they would be ready STOP Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so , but I did n't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune STOP Well , blamed if the king did n't bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight off -- sale two days after the funeral ; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to STOP So the next day after the funeral , along about noon-time , the girls ' joy got the first jolt STOP A couple of nigger traders come along , and the king sold them the niggers reasonable , for three-day drafts as they called it , and away they went , the two sons up the river to Memphis , and their mother down the river to Orleans STOP I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief ; they cried around each other , and took on so it most made me down sick to see it STOP The girls said they had n't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town STOP I ca n't ever get it out of my memory , the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other 's necks and crying ; and I reckon I could n't a stood it all , but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I had n't knowed the sale war n't no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two STOP The thing made a big stir in the town , too , and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way STOP It injured the frauds some ; but the old fool he bulled right along , spite of all the duke could say or do , and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy STOP Next day was auction day STOP About broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up , and I see by their look that there was trouble STOP The king says : Was you in my room night before last STOP No , your majesty -- which was the way I always called him when nobody but our gang war n't around STOP Was you in there yisterday er last night STOP No , your majesty STOP Honor bright , now -- no lies STOP Honor bright , your majesty , I 'm telling you the truth STOP I hai n't been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to you STOP The duke says : Have you seen anybody else go in there STOP No , your grace , not as I remember , I believe STOP Stop and think STOP I studied awhile and see my chance ; then I says : Well , I see the niggers go in there several times STOP Both of them gave a little jump , and looked like they had n't ever expected it , and then like they _had_ STOP Then the duke says : What , all of them STOP No -- leastways , not all at once -- that is , I do n't think I ever see them all come _out_ at once but just one time STOP Hello STOP When was that STOP It was the day we had the funeral STOP In the morning STOP It war n't early , because I overslept STOP I was just starting down the ladder , and I see them STOP Well , go on , _go_ on STOP What did they do STOP How 'd they act STOP They did n't do nothing STOP And they did n't act anyway much , as fur as I see STOP They tiptoed away ; so I seen , easy enough , that they 'd shoved in there to do up your majesty 's room , or something , s'posing you was up ; and found you _warn't_ up , and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up , if they had n't already waked you up STOP Great guns , _this_ is a go STOP says the king ; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly STOP They stood there a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute , and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle , and says : It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand STOP They let on to be _sorry_ they was going out of this region STOP And I believed they _was_ sorry , and so did you , and so did everybody STOP Do n't ever tell _me_ any more that a nigger ai n't got any histrionic talent STOP Why , the way they played that thing it would fool _anybody_ STOP In my opinion , there's a fortune in 'em STOP If I had capital and a theater , I would n't want a better lay-out than that -- and here we 've gone and sold 'em for a song STOP Yes , and ai n't privileged to sing the song yet STOP Say , where _is_ that song -- that draft STOP In the bank for to be collected STOP Where _would_ it be STOP Well , _that's_ all right then , thank goodness STOP Says I , kind of timid-like : Is something gone wrong STOP The king whirls on me and rips out : None o ' your business STOP You keep your head shet , and mind y ' r own affairs -- if you got any STOP Long as you 're in this town do n't you forgit _that_ -- you hear STOP Then he says to the duke , We got to jest swaller it and say noth ' n ' : mum 's the word for _us_ STOP As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again , and says : Quick sales _and_ small profits STOP It 's a good business -- yes STOP The king snarls around on him and says : I was trying to do for the best in sellin ' 'em out so quick STOP If the profits has turned out to be none , lackin ' considable , and none to carry , is it my fault any more ' n it 's yourn STOP Well , _they'd_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn't_ if I could a got my advice listened to STOP The king sassed back as much as was safe for him , and then swapped around and lit into _me_ again STOP He give me down the banks for not coming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way -- said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up STOP And then waltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile , and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning , and he 'd be blamed if he 'd ever do it again STOP So they went off a-jawing ; and I felt dreadful glad I 'd worked it all off on to the niggers , and yet hadn't done the niggers no harm by it STOP STOP BY and by it was getting-up time STOP So I come down the ladder and started for down-stairs ; but as I come to the girls ' room the door was open , and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk , which was open and she'd been packing things in it -- getting ready to go to England STOP But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap , and had her face in her hands , crying STOP I felt awful bad to see it ; of course anybody would STOP I went in there and says : Miss Mary Jane , you ca n't a-bear to see people in trouble , and I ca n't -- most always STOP Tell me about it STOP So she done it STOP And it was the niggers -- I just expected it STOP She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her ; she didn't know _how_ she was ever going to be happy there , knowing the mother and the children war n't ever going to see each other no more -- and then busted out bitterer than ever , and flung up her hands , and says : Oh , dear , dear , to think they ai n't _ever_ going to see each other any more STOP But they _will_ -- and inside of two weeks -- and I _know_ it STOP says I STOP Laws , it was out before I could think STOP And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_ , say it _again_ , say it _again_ STOP I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much , and was in a close place STOP I asked her to let me think a minute ; and she set there , very impatient and excited and handsome , but looking kind of happy and eased-up , like a person that 's had a tooth pulled out STOP So I went to studying it out STOP I says to myself , I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks , though I ai n't had no experience , and ca n't say for certain ; but it looks so to me , anyway ; and yet here 's a case where I 'm blest if it do n't look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie STOP I must lay it by in my mind , and think it over some time or other , it's so kind of strange and unregular STOP I never see nothing like it STOP Well , I says to myself at last , I 'm a-going to chance it ;

and as for the king , he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world STOP Oh , he done it admirable STOP Lots of the principal people gethered around the king , to let him see they was on his side STOP That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death STOP Pretty soon he begun to speak , and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an Englishman -- not the king 's way , though the king 's _was_ pretty good for an imitation STOP I ca n't give the old gent 's words , nor I ca n't imitate him ; but he turned around to the crowd , and says , about like this : This is a surprise to me which I was n't looking for ; and I'll acknowledge , candid and frank , I ai n't very well fixed to meet it and answer it ; for my brother and me has had misfortunes ; he 's broke his arm , and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake STOP I am Peter Wilks ' brother Harvey , and this is his brother William , which ca n't hear nor speak -- and ca n't even make signs to amount to much , now't he 's only got one hand to work them with STOP We are who we say we are ; and in a day or two , when I get the baggage , I can prove it STOP But up till then I wo n't say nothing more , but go to the hotel and wait STOP So him and the new dummy started off ; and the king he laughs , and blethers out : Broke his arm -- _very_ likely , _ain't_ it ? -- and very convenient , too , for a fraud that 's got to make signs , and ai n't learnt how STOP Lost their baggage STOP That 's _mighty_ good ! -- and mighty ingenious -- under the _circumstances_ STOP So he laughed again ; and so did everybody else , except three or four , or maybe half a dozen STOP One of these was that doctor ; another one was a sharp-looking gentleman , with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made out of carpet-stuff , that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice , and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their heads -- it was Levi Bell , the lawyer that was gone up to Louisville ; and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said , and was listening to the king now STOP And when the king got done this husky up and says : Say , looky here ; if you are Harvey Wilks , when 'd you come to this town STOP The day before the funeral , friend , says the king STOP But what time o ' day STOP In the evenin ' -- 'bout an hour er two before sundown STOP _How'd_ you come STOP I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati STOP Well , then , how 'd you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_ ' -- in a canoe STOP I war n't up at the Pint in the mornin ' STOP It 's a lie STOP Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher STOP Preacher be hanged , he 's a fraud and a liar STOP He was up at the Pint that mornin ' STOP I live up there , do n't I STOP Well , I was up there , and he was up there STOP I see him there STOP He come in a canoe , along with Tim Collins and a boy STOP The doctor he up and says : Would you know the boy again if you was to see him , Hines STOP I reckon I would , but I do n't know STOP Why , yonder he is , now STOP I know him perfectly easy STOP It was me he pointed at STOP The doctor says : Neighbors , I do n't know whether the new couple is frauds or not ; but if _these_ two ai n't frauds , I am an idiot , that 's all STOP I think it 's our duty to see that they do n't get away from here till we 've looked into this thing STOP Come along , Hines ; come along , the rest of you STOP We 'll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple , and I reckon we 'll find out _something_ before we get through STOP It was nuts for the crowd , though maybe not for the king 's friends ; so we all started STOP It was about sundown STOP The doctor he led me along by the hand , and was plenty kind enough , but he never let go my hand STOP We all got in a big room in the hotel , and lit up some candles , and fetched in the new couple STOP First , the doctor says : I do n't wish to be too hard on these two men , but I think they're frauds , and they may have complices that we do n't know nothing about STOP If they have , wo n't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left STOP It ai n't unlikely STOP If these men ai n't frauds , they won't object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they 're all right -- ai n't that so STOP Everybody agreed to that STOP So I judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart STOP But the king he only looked sorrowful , and says : Gentlemen , I wish the money was there , for I ai n't got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair , open , out-and-out investigation o ' this misable business ; but , alas , the money ai n't there ; you k ' n send and see , if you want to STOP Where is it , then STOP Well , when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it inside o ' the straw tick o ' my bed , not wishin ' to bank it for the few days we 'd be here , and considerin ' the bed a safe place , we not bein' used to niggers , and suppos ' n ' 'em honest , like servants in England STOP The niggers stole it the very next mornin ' after I had went down stairs ; and when I sold 'em I had n't missed the money yit , so they got clean away with it STOP My servant here k ' n tell you 'bout it , gentlemen STOP The doctor and several said Shucks STOP and I see nobody did n't altogether believe him STOP One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it STOP I said no , but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away , and I never thought nothing , only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them STOP That was all they asked me STOP Then the doctor whirls on me and says : Are _you_ English , too STOP I says yes ; and him and some others laughed , and said , Stuff STOP Well , then they sailed in on the general investigation , and there we had it , up and down , hour in , hour out , and nobody never said a word about supper , nor ever seemed to think about it -- and so they kept it up , and kept it up ; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see STOP They made the king tell his yarn , and they made the old gentleman tell his ' n ; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies STOP And by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed STOP The king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye , and so I knowed enough to talk on the right side STOP I begun to tell about Sheffield , and how we lived there , and all about the English Wilkses , and so on ; but I did n't get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh ; and Levi Bell , the lawyer , says : Set down , my boy ; I would n't strain myself if I was you STOP I reckon you ai n't used to lying , it do n't seem to come handy ; what you want is practice STOP You do it pretty awkward STOP I did n't care nothing for the compliment , but I was glad to be let off , anyway STOP The doctor he started to say something , and turns and says : If you 'd been in town at first , Levi Bell -- The king broke in and reached out his hand , and says : Why , is this my poor dead brother 's old friend that he 's wrote so often about STOP The lawyer and him shook hands , and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased , and they talked right along awhile , and then got to one side and talked low ; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says : That 'll fix it STOP I 'll take the order and send it , along with your brother 's , and then they 'll know it 's all right STOP So they got some paper and a pen , and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side , and chawed his tongue , and scrawled off something ; and then they give the pen to the duke -- and then for the first time the duke looked sick STOP But he took the pen and wrote STOP So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says : You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names STOP The old gentleman wrote , but nobody could n't read it STOP The lawyer looked powerful astonished , and says : Well , it beats _me_ -- and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket , and examined them , and then examined the old man 's writing , and then _them_ again ; and then says : These old letters is from Harvey Wilks ; and here 's _these_ two handwritings , and anybody can see they didn't write them ( the king and the duke looked sold and foolish , I tell you , to see how the lawyer had took them in ) , and here 's _this_ old gentleman 's hand writing , and anybody can tell , easy enough , _he_ didn't write them -- fact is , the scratches he makes ai n't properly _writing_ at all STOP Now , here 's some letters from -- The new old gentleman says : If you please , let me explain STOP Nobody can read my hand but my brother there -- so he copies for me STOP It 's _his_ hand you 've got there , not mine STOP _Well_ STOP says the lawyer , this _is_ a state of things STOP I 've got some of William 's letters , too ; so if you 'll get him to write a line or so we can com -- He _can't_ write with his left hand , says the old gentleman STOP If he could use his right hand , you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too STOP Look at both , please -- they 're by the same hand STOP The lawyer done it , and says : I believe it 's so -- and if it ai n't so , there 's a heap stronger resemblance than I 'd noticed before , anyway STOP Well , well , well STOP I thought we was right on the track of a solution , but it 's gone to grass , partly STOP But anyway , one thing is proved -- _these_ two ai n't either of 'em Wilkses -- and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke STOP Well , what do you think STOP That muleheaded old fool would n't give in _then_ STOP Indeed he would n't STOP Said it war n't no fair test STOP Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world , and had n't tried to write -- _he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper STOP And so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying _himself_ ; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in , and says : I 've thought of something STOP Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br -- helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying STOP Yes , says somebody , me and Ab Turner done it STOP We 're both here STOP Then the old man turns towards the king , and says : Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast STOP Blamed if the king did n't have to brace up mighty quick , or he 'd a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under , it took him so sudden ; and , mind you , it was a thing that was calculated to make most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice , because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man STOP He whitened a little ; he could n't help it ; and it was mighty still in there , and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him STOP Says I to myself , _now_ he 'll throw up the sponge -- there ai n't no more use STOP Well , did he STOP A body ca n't hardly believe it , but he did n't STOP I reckon he thought he 'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out , so they 'd thin out , and him and the duke could break loose and get away STOP Anyway , he set there , and pretty soon he begun to smile , and says : Mf STOP It 's a _very_ tough question , _ain't_ it STOP _yes_ , sir , I k ' n tell you what 's tattooed on his breast STOP It 's jest a small , thin , blue arrow -- that 's what it is ; and if you do n't look clost , you ca n't see it STOP _now_ what do you say -- hey STOP Well , I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek STOP The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard , and his eye lights up like he judged he 'd got the king _this_ time , and says : There -- you 've heard what he said STOP Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks ' breast STOP Both of them spoke up and says : We did n't see no such mark STOP Good STOP says the old gentleman STOP Now , what you _did_ see on his breast was a small dim P , and a B ( which is an initial he dropped when he was young ) , and a W , with dashes between them , so : P -- B -- W -- and he marked them that way on a piece of paper STOP Come , ai n't that what you saw STOP Both of them spoke up again , and says : No , we _didn't_ STOP We never seen any marks at all STOP Well , everybody _was_ in a state of mind now , and they sings out : The whole _bilin_ ' of 'm 's frauds STOP Le 's duck 'em STOP le 's drown 'em STOP le 's ride 'em on a rail STOP and everybody was whooping at once , and there was a rattling powwow STOP But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells , and says : Gentlemen -- gentle_men ! _ Hear me just a word -- just a _single_ word -- if you _please_ STOP There 's one way yet -- let 's go and dig up the corpse and look STOP That took them STOP Hooray STOP they all shouted , and was starting right off ; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out : Hold on , hold on STOP Collar all these four men and the boy , and fetch _them_ along , too STOP We 'll do it STOP they all shouted ; and if we do n't find them marks we'll lynch the whole gang STOP I _was_ scared , now , I tell you STOP But there war n't no getting away , you know STOP They gripped us all , and marched us right along , straight for the graveyard , which was a mile and a half down the river , and the whole town at our heels , for we made noise enough , and it was only nine in the evening STOP As we went by our house I wished I had n't sent Mary Jane out of town ; because now if I could tip her the wink she 'd light out and save me , and blow on our dead-beats STOP Well , we swarmed along down the river road , just carrying on like wildcats ; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up , and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter , and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves STOP This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in ; and I was kinder stunned ; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for ; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to , and see all the fun , and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come , here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks STOP If they did n't find them -- I could n't bear to think about it ; and yet , somehow , I could n't think about nothing else STOP It got darker and darker , and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip ; but that big husky had me by the wrist -- Hines -- and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip STOP He dragged me right along , he was so excited , and I had to run to keep up STOP When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow STOP And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted , but nobody hadn't thought to fetch a lantern STOP But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning , and sent a man to the nearest house , a half a mile off , to borrow one STOP So they dug and dug like everything ; and it got awful dark , and the rain started , and the wind swished and swushed along , and the lightning come brisker and brisker , and the thunder boomed ; but them people never took no notice of it , they was so full of this business ; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd , and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave , and the next second the dark wiped it all out , and you could n't see nothing at all STOP At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid , and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was , to scrouge in and get a sight , you never see ; and in the dark , that way , it was awful STOP Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so , and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world , he was so excited and panting STOP All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare , and somebody sings out : By the living jingo , here 's the bag of gold on his breast STOP Hines let out a whoop , like everybody else , and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look , and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ai n't nobody can tell STOP I had the road all to myself , and I fairly flew -- leastways , I had it all to myself except the solid dark , and the now-and-then glares , and the buzzing of the rain , and the thrashing of the wind , and the splitting of the thunder ; and sure as you are born I did clip it along STOP When I struck the town I see there war n't nobody out in the storm , so I never hunted for no back streets , but humped it straight through the main one ; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it STOP No light there ; the house all dark -- which made me feel sorry and disappointed , I did n't know why STOP But at last , just as I was sailing by , _flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane 's window STOP and my heart swelled up sudden , like to bust ; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark , and was n't ever going to be before me no more in this world STOP She _was_ the best girl I ever see , and had the most sand STOP The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the towhead , I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow , and the first time the lightning showed me one that was n't chained I snatched it and shoved STOP It was a canoe , and war n't fastened with nothing but a rope STOP The towhead was a rattling big distance off , away out there in the middle of the river , but I did n't lose no time ; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it STOP But I did n't STOP As I sprung aboard I sung out : Out with you , Jim , and set her loose STOP Glory be to goodness , we 're shut of them STOP Jim lit out , and was a-coming for me with both arms spread , he was so full of joy ; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards ; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one , and it most scared the livers and lights out of me STOP But Jim fished me out , and was going to hug me and bless me , and so on , he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke , but I says : Not now ; have it for breakfast , have it for breakfast STOP Cut loose and let her slide STOP So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river , and it _did_ seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river , and nobody to bother us STOP I had to skip around a bit , and jump up and crack my heels a few times -- I could n't help it ; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well , and held my breath and listened and waited ; and sure enough , when the next flash busted out over the water , here they come ! -- and just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff hum STOP It was the king and the duke STOP So I wilted right down on to the planks then , and give up ; and it was all I could do to keep from crying STOP STOP WHEN they got aboard the king went for me , and shook me by the collar , and says : Tryin ' to give us the slip , was ye , you pup STOP Tired of our company , hey STOP I says : No , your majesty , we war n't -- _please_ do n't , your majesty STOP Quick , then , and tell us what _was_ your idea , or I 'll shake the insides out o ' you STOP Honest , I 'll tell you everything just as it happened , your majesty STOP The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me , and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year , and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix ; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold , and made a rush for the coffin , he lets go of me and whispers , 'Heel it now , or they 'll hang ye , sure ! STOP and I lit out STOP It did n't seem no good for _me_ to stay -- I could n't do nothing , and I did n't want to be hung if I could get away STOP So I never stopped running till I found the canoe ; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry , or they 'd catch me and hang me yet , and said I was afeard you and the duke was n't alive now , and I was awful sorry , and so was Jim , and was awful glad when we see you coming ; you may ask Jim if I did n't STOP Jim said it was so ; and the king told him to shut up , and said , Oh , yes , it 's _mighty_ likely STOP and shook me up again , and said he reckoned he 'd drownd me STOP But the duke says : Leggo the boy , you old idiot STOP Would _you_ a done any different STOP Did you inquire around for _him_ when you got loose STOP I do n't remember it STOP So the king let go of me , and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it STOP But the duke says : You better a blame ' sight give _yourself_ a good cussing , for you're the one that 's entitled to it most STOP You hai n't done a thing from the start that had any sense in it , except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark STOP That _was_ bright -- it was right down bully ; and it was the thing that saved us STOP For if it had n't been for that they 'd a jailed us till them Englishmen 's baggage come -- and then -- the penitentiary , you bet STOP But that trick took 'em to the graveyard , and the gold done us a still bigger kindness ; for if the excited fools had n't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we 'd a slept in our cravats to-night -- cravats warranted to _wear_ , too -- longer than _we'd_ need 'em STOP They was still a minute -- thinking ; then the king says , kind of absent-minded like : Mf STOP And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it STOP That made me squirm STOP Yes , says the duke , kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic , _we_ did STOP After about a half a minute the king drawls out : Leastways , I did STOP The duke says , the same way : On the contrary , I did STOP The king kind of ruffles up , and says : Looky here , Bilgewater , what ' r you referrin ' to STOP The duke says , pretty brisk : When it comes to that , maybe you 'll let me ask , what was _you_ referring to STOP Shucks STOP says the king , very sarcastic ; but I do n't know -- maybe you was asleep , and did n't know what you was about STOP The duke bristles up now , and says : Oh , let _up_ on this cussed nonsense ; do you take me for a blame ' fool STOP Do n't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin STOP _Yes_ , sir STOP I know you _do_ know , because you done it yourself STOP It 's a lie ! -- and the duke went for him STOP The king sings out : Take y ' r hands off ! -- leggo my throat ! -- I take it all back STOP The duke says : Well , you just own up , first , that you _did_ hide that money there , intending to give me the slip one of these days , and come back and dig it up , and have it all to yourself STOP Wait jest a minute , duke -- answer me this one question , honest and fair ; if you did n't put the money there , say it , and I 'll b'lieve you , and take back everything I said STOP You old scoundrel , I did n't , and you know I did n't STOP There , now STOP Well , then , I b'lieve you STOP But answer me only jest this one more -- now _don't_ git mad ; did n't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it STOP The duke never said nothing for a little bit ; then he says : Well , I do n't care if I _did_ , I did n't _do_ it , anyway STOP But you not only had it in mind to do it , but you _done_ it STOP I wisht I never die if I done it , duke , and that 's honest STOP I wo n't say I war n't goin ' to do it , because I _was_ ; but you -- I mean somebody -- got in ahead o ' me STOP It 's a lie STOP You done it , and you got to _say_ you done it , or -- The king began to gurgle , and then he gasps out : 'Nough ! -- I _own up ! _ I was very glad to hear him say that ; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before STOP So the duke took his hands off and says : If you ever deny it again I 'll drown you STOP It 's _well_ for you to set there and blubber like a baby -- it 's fitten for you , after the way you 've acted STOP I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything -- and I a-trusting you all the time , like you was my own father STOP You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers , and you never say a word for 'em STOP It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_ that rubbage STOP Cuss you , I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit -- you wanted to get what money I 'd got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another , and scoop it _all_ STOP The king says , timid , and still a-snuffling : Why , duke , it was you that said make up the deffisit ; it war n't me STOP Dry up STOP I do n't want to hear no more out of you STOP says the duke STOP And _now_ you see what you GOT by it STOP They 've got all their own money back , and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_ STOP G'long to bed , and do n't you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits , long 's _you_ live STOP So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort , and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle ; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again , and the tighter they got the lovinger they got , and went off a-snoring in each other 's arms STOP They both got powerful mellow , but I noticed the king did n't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again STOP That made me feel easy and satisfied STOP Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble , and I told Jim everything STOP STOP WE das n't stop again at any town for days and days ; kept right along down the river STOP We was down south in the warm weather now , and a mighty long ways from home STOP We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them , hanging down from the limbs like long , gray beards STOP It was the first I ever see it growing , and it made the woods look solemn and dismal STOP So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger , and they begun to work the villages again STOP First they done a lecture on temperance ; but they did n't make enough for them both to get drunk on STOP Then in another village they started a dancing-school ; but they did n't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does ; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town STOP Another time they tried to go at yellocution ; but they did n't yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing , and made them skip out STOP They tackled missionarying , and mesmerizing , and doctoring , and telling fortunes , and a little of everything ; but they could n't seem to have no luck STOP So at last they got just about dead broke , and laid around the raft as she floated along , thinking and thinking , and never saying nothing , by the half a day at a time , and dreadful blue and desperate STOP And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time STOP Jim and me got uneasy STOP We did n't like the look of it STOP We judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever STOP We turned it over and over , and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody 's house or store , or was going into the counterfeit-money business , or something STOP So then we was pretty scared , and made up an agreement that we would n't have nothing in the world to do with such actions , and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind STOP Well , early one morning we hid the raft in a good , safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville , and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet STOP ( House to rob , you _mean_ , says I to myself ; and when you get through robbing it you 'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft -- and you 'll have to take it out in wondering . STOP And he said if he war n't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right , and we was to come along STOP So we stayed where we was STOP The duke he fretted and sweated around , and was in a mighty sour way STOP He scolded us for everything , and we couldn't seem to do nothing right ; he found fault with every little thing STOP Something was a-brewing , sure STOP I was good and glad when midday come and no king ; we could have a change , anyway -- and maybe a chance for _the_ change on top of it STOP So me and the duke went up to the village , and hunted around there for the king , and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery , very tight , and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport , and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all his might , and so tight he could n't walk , and could n't do nothing to them STOP The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool , and the king begun to sass back , and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs , and spun down the river road like a deer , for I see our chance ; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again STOP I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy , and sung out : Set her loose , Jim STOP we 're all right now STOP But there war n't no answer , and nobody come out of the wigwam STOP Jim was gone STOP I set up a shout -- and then another -- and then another one ; and run this way and that in the woods , whooping and screeching ; but it warn't no use -- old Jim was gone STOP Then I set down and cried ; I could n't help it STOP But I could n't set still long STOP Pretty soon I went out on the road , trying to think what I better do , and I run across a boy walking , and asked him if he 'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so , and he says : Yes STOP Whereabouts STOP says I STOP Down to Silas Phelps ' place , two mile below here STOP He 's a runaway nigger , and they 've got him STOP Was you looking for him STOP You bet I ai n't STOP I run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago , and he said if I hollered he 'd cut my livers out -- and told me to lay down and stay where I was ; and I done it STOP Been there ever since ; afeard to come out STOP Well , he says , you need n't be afeard no more , becuz they 've got him STOP He run off f 'm down South , som'ers STOP It 's a good job they got him STOP Well , I _reckon_ STOP There 's two hunderd dollars reward on him STOP It's like picking up money out ' n the road STOP Yes , it is -- and I could a had it if I 'd been big enough ; I see him _first_ STOP Who nailed him STOP It was an old fellow -- a stranger -- and he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars , becuz he 's got to go up the river and ca n't wait STOP Think o ' that , now STOP You bet _I'd_ wait , if it was seven year STOP That 's me , every time , says I STOP But maybe his chance ai n't worth no more than that , if he 'll sell it so cheap STOP Maybe there 's something ai n't straight about it STOP But it _is_ , though -- straight as a string STOP I see the handbill myself STOP It tells all about him , to a dot -- paints him like a picture , and tells the plantation he 's frum , below Newr_leans_ STOP No-sirree-_bob_ , they ai n't no trouble 'bout _that_ speculation , you bet you STOP Say , gim me a chaw tobacker , wo n't ye STOP I did n't have none , so he left STOP I went to the raft , and set down in the wigwam to think STOP But I could n't come to nothing STOP I thought till I wore my head sore , but I could n't see no way out of the trouble STOP After all this long journey , and after all we 'd done for them scoundrels , here it was all come to nothing , everything all busted up and ruined , because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that , and make him a slave again all his life , and amongst strangers , too , for forty dirty dollars STOP Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family was , as long as he 'd _got_ to be a slave , and so I 'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was STOP But I soon give up that notion for two things : she 'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her , and so she 'd sell him straight down the river again ; and if she did n't , everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger , and they 'd make Jim feel it all the time , and so he 'd feel ornery and disgraced STOP And then think of _me_ STOP It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom ; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I 'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame STOP That 's just the way : a person does a low-down thing , and then he do n't want to take no consequences of it STOP Thinks as long as he can hide it , it ai n't no disgrace STOP That was my fix exactly STOP The more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me , and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling STOP And at last , when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven , whilst I was stealing a poor old woman 's nigger that had n't ever done me no harm , and now was showing me there 's One that 's always on the lookout , and ai n't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further , I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared STOP Well , I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked , and so I war n't so much to blame ; but something inside of me kept saying , There was the Sunday-school , you could a gone to it ; and if you 'd a done it they 'd a learnt you there that people that acts as I 'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire STOP It made me shiver STOP And I about made up my mind to pray , and see if I could n't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better STOP So I kneeled down STOP But the words would n't come STOP Why would n't they STOP It war n't no use to try and hide it from Him STOP Nor from _me_ , neither STOP I knowed very well why they would n't come STOP It was because my heart warn't right ; it was because I war n't square ; it was because I was playing double STOP I was letting _on_ to give up sin , but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all STOP I was trying to make my mouth _say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing , and go and write to that nigger 's owner and tell where he was ; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie , and He knowed it STOP You ca n't pray a lie -- I found that out STOP So I was full of trouble , full as I could be ; and did n't know what to do STOP At last I had an idea ; and I says , I 'll go and write the letter -- and then see if I can pray STOP Why , it was astonishing , the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off , and my troubles all gone STOP So I got a piece of paper and a pencil , all glad and excited , and set down and wrote : Miss Watson , your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville , and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send STOP _Huck Finn._ I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life , and I knowed I could pray now STOP But I did n't do it straight off , but laid the paper down and set there thinking -- thinking how good it was all this happened so , and how near I come to being lost and going to hell STOP And went on thinking STOP And got to thinking over our trip down the river ; and I see Jim before me all the time : in the day and in the night-time , sometimes moonlight , sometimes storms , and we a-floating along , talking and singing and laughing STOP But somehow I could n't seem to strike no places to harden me against him , but only the other kind STOP I 'd see him standing my watch on top of his ' n , 'stead of calling me , so I could go on sleeping ; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog ; and when I come to him again in the swamp , up there where the feud was ; and such-like times ; and would always call me honey , and pet me and do everything he could think of for me , and how good he always was ; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard , and he was so grateful , and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world , and the _only_ one he's got now ; and then I happened to look around and see that paper STOP It was a close place STOP I took it up , and held it in my hand STOP I was a-trembling , because I 'd got to decide , forever , betwixt two things , and I knowed it STOP I studied a minute , sort of holding my breath , and then says to myself : All right , then , I 'll _go_ to hell -- and tore it up STOP It was awful thoughts and awful words , but they was said STOP And I let them stay said ; and never thought no more about reforming STOP I shoved the whole thing out of my head , and said I would take up wickedness again , which was in my line , being brung up to it , and the other war n't STOP And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again ; and if I could think up anything worse , I would do that , too ; because as long as I was in , and in for good , I might as well go the whole hog STOP Then I set to thinking over how to get at it , and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind ; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me STOP So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece , and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it , and hid it there , and then turned in STOP I slept the night through , and got up before it was light , and had my breakfast , and put on my store clothes , and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle , and took the canoe and cleared for shore STOP I landed below where I judged was Phelps 's place , and hid my bundle in the woods , and then filled up the canoe with water , and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her , about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank STOP Then I struck up the road , and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it , Phelps 's Sawmill , and when I come to the farm-houses , two or three hundred yards further along , I kept my eyes peeled , but didn't see nobody around , though it was good daylight now STOP But I did n't mind , because I did n't want to see nobody just yet -- I only wanted to get the lay of the land STOP According to my plan , I was going to turn up there from the village , not from below STOP So I just took a look , and shoved along , straight for town STOP Well , the very first man I see when I got there was the duke STOP He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch -- three-night performance -- like that other time STOP They had the cheek , them frauds STOP I was right on him before I could shirk STOP He looked astonished , and says : Hel-_lo_ STOP Where 'd _you_ come from STOP Then he says , kind of glad and eager , Where 's the raft ? -- got her in a good place STOP I says : Why , that 's just what I was going to ask your grace STOP Then he did n't look so joyful , and says : What was your idea for asking _me_ STOP he says STOP Well , I says , when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself , we ca n't get him home for hours , till he 's soberer ; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait STOP A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep , and so I went along ; but when we was dragging him to the boat , and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along , he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run , and we after him STOP We did n't have no dog , and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out STOP We never got him till dark ; then we fetched him over , and I started down for the raft STOP When I got there and see it was gone , I says to myself , 'They 've got into trouble and had to leave ; and they 've took my nigger , which is the only nigger I 've got in the world , and now I 'm in a strange country , and ai n't got no property no more , nor nothing , and no way to make my living ; ' so I set down and cried STOP I slept in the woods all night STOP But what _did_ become of the raft , then ? -- and Jim -- poor Jim STOP Blamed if I know -- that is , what 's become of the raft STOP That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars , and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he 'd spent for whisky ; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone , we said , 'That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us , and run off down the river . STOP I would n't shake my _nigger_ , would I ? -- the only nigger I had in the world , and the only property STOP We never thought of that STOP Fact is , I reckon we 'd come to consider him _our_ nigger ; yes , we did consider him so -- goodness knows we had trouble enough for him STOP So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke , there war n't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake STOP And I 've pegged along ever since , dry as a powder-horn STOP Where's that ten cents STOP Give it here STOP I had considerable money , so I give him ten cents , but begged him to spend it for something to eat , and give me some , because it was all the money I had , and I had n't had nothing to eat since yesterday STOP He never said nothing STOP The next minute he whirls on me and says : Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us STOP We 'd skin him if he done that STOP How can he blow STOP Hai n't he run off STOP No STOP That old fool sold him , and never divided with me , and the money's gone STOP _Sold_ him STOP I says , and begun to cry ; why , he was _my_ nigger , and that was my money STOP Where is he ? -- I want my nigger STOP Well , you ca n't _get_ your nigger , that 's all -- so dry up your blubbering STOP Looky here -- do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us STOP Blamed if I think I 'd trust you STOP Why , if you _was_ to blow on us -- He stopped , but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before STOP I went on a-whimpering , and says : I do n't want to blow on nobody ; and I ai n't got no time to blow , nohow STOP I got to turn out and find my nigger STOP He looked kinder bothered , and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm , thinking , and wrinkling up his forehead STOP At last he says : I 'll tell you something STOP We got to be here three days STOP If you'll promise you wo n't blow , and wo n't let the nigger blow , I 'll tell you where to find him STOP So I promised , and he says : A farmer by the name of Silas Ph -- and then he stopped STOP You see , he started to tell me the truth ; but when he stopped that way , and begun to study and think again , I reckoned he was changing his mind STOP And so he was STOP He would n't trust me ; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days STOP So pretty soon he says : The man that bought him is named Abram Foster -- Abram G. Foster -- and he lives forty mile back here in the country , on the road to Lafayette STOP All right , I says , I can walk it in three days STOP And I 'll start this very afternoon STOP No you wont , you 'll start _now_ ; and do n't you lose any time about it , neither , nor do any gabbling by the way STOP Just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along , and then you wo n't get into trouble with _us_ , d 'ye hear STOP That was the order I wanted , and that was the one I played for STOP I wanted to be left free to work my plans STOP So clear out , he says ; and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to STOP Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger -- some idiots do n't require documents -- leastways I 've heard there 's such down South here STOP And when you tell him the handbill and the reward 's bogus , maybe he 'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting 'em out STOP Go 'long now , and tell him anything you want to ; but mind you do n't work your jaw any _between_ here and there STOP So I left , and struck for the back country STOP I did n't look around , but I kinder felt like he was watching me STOP But I knowed I could tire him out at that STOP I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before I stopped ; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps ' STOP I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around , because I wanted to stop Jim 's mouth till these fellows could get away STOP I did n't want no trouble with their kind STOP I 'd seen all I wanted to of them , and wanted to get entirely shut of them STOP STOP WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like , and hot and sunshiny ; the hands was gone to the fields ; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody 's dead and gone ; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful , because you feel like it's spirits whispering -- spirits that 's been dead ever so many years -- and you always think they 're talking about _you_ STOP As a general thing it makes a body wish _he_ was dead , too , and done with it all STOP Phelps ' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations , and they all look alike STOP A rail fence round a two-acre yard ; a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps , like barrels of a different length , to climb over the fence with , and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse ; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard , but mostly it was bare and smooth , like an old hat with the nap rubbed off ; big double log-house for the white folks -- hewed logs , with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar , and these mud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another ; round-log kitchen , with a big broad , open but roofed passage joining it to the house ; log smoke-house back of the kitchen ; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t'other side the smoke-house ; one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence , and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut ; bench by the kitchen door , with bucket of water and a gourd ; hound asleep there in the sun ; more hounds asleep round about ; about three shade trees away off in a corner ; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence ; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch ; then the cotton fields begins , and after the fields the woods STOP I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper , and started for the kitchen STOP When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again ; and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead -- for that _is_ the lonesomest sound in the whole world STOP I went right along , not fixing up any particular plan , but just trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come ; for I 'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if I left it alone STOP When I got half-way , first one hound and then another got up and went for me , and of course I stopped and faced them , and kept still STOP And such another powwow as they made STOP In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel , as you may say -- spokes made out of dogs -- circle of fifteen of them packed together around me , with their necks and noses stretched up towards me , a-barking and howling ; and more a-coming ; you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres STOP A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her hand , singing out , Begone _you_ Tige STOP you Spot STOP begone sah STOP and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling , and then the rest followed ; and the next second half of them come back , wagging their tails around me , and making friends with me STOP There ain't no harm in a hound , nohow STOP And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts , and they hung on to their mother 's gown , and peeped out from behind her at me , bashful , the way they always do STOP And here comes the white woman running from the house , about forty-five or fifty year old , bareheaded , and her spinning-stick in her hand ; and behind her comes her little white children , acting the same way the little niggers was doing STOP She was smiling all over so she could hardly stand -- and says : It 's _you_ , at last ! -- _ain't_ it STOP I out with a Yes 'm before I thought STOP She grabbed me and hugged me tight ; and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook ; and the tears come in her eyes , and run down over ; and she could n't seem to hug and shake enough , and kept saying , You do n't look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would ; but law sakes , I do n't care for that , I 'm so glad to see you STOP Dear , dear , it does seem like I could eat you up STOP Children , it 's your cousin Tom ! -- tell him howdy STOP But they ducked their heads , and put their fingers in their mouths , and hid behind her STOP So she run on : Lize , hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away -- or did you get your breakfast on the boat STOP I said I had got it on the boat STOP So then she started for the house , leading me by the hand , and the children tagging after STOP When we got there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair , and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me , holding both of my hands , and says : Now I can have a _good_ look at you ; and , laws-a-me , I 've been hungry for it a many and a many a time , all these long years , and it 's come at last STOP We been expecting you a couple of days and more STOP What kep' you ? -- boat get aground STOP Yes 'm -- she -- Do n't say yes 'm -- say Aunt Sally STOP Where 'd she get aground STOP I did n't rightly know what to say , because I did n't know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down STOP But I go a good deal on instinct ; and my instinct said she would be coming up -- from down towards Orleans STOP That did n't help me much , though ; for I did n't know the names of bars down that way STOP I see I 'd got to invent a bar , or forget the name of the one we got aground on -- or -- Now I struck an idea , and fetched it out : It war n't the grounding -- that did n't keep us back but a little STOP We blowed out a cylinder-head STOP Good gracious STOP anybody hurt STOP No 'm STOP Killed a nigger STOP Well , it 's lucky ; because sometimes people do get hurt STOP Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook , and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man STOP And I think he died afterwards STOP He was a Baptist STOP Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well STOP Yes , I remember now , he _did_ die STOP Mortification set in , and they had to amputate him STOP But it did n't save him STOP Yes , it was mortification -- that was it STOP He turned blue all over , and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection STOP They say he was a sight to look at STOP Your uncle 's been up to the town every day to fetch you STOP And he 's gone again , not more ' n an hour ago ; he 'll be back any minute now STOP You must a met him on the road , did n't you ? -- oldish man , with a -- No , I did n't see nobody , Aunt Sally STOP The boat landed just at daylight , and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country , to put in the time and not get here too soon ; and so I come down the back way STOP Who 'd you give the baggage to STOP Nobody STOP Why , child , it 'll be stole STOP Not where I hid it I reckon it wo n't , I says STOP How 'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat STOP It was kinder thin ice , but I says : The captain see me standing around , and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore ; so he took me in the texas to the officers' lunch , and give me all I wanted STOP I was getting so uneasy I could n't listen good STOP I had my mind on the children all the time ; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little , and find out who I was STOP But I could n't get no show , Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so STOP Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back , because she says : But here we 're a-running on this way , and you hai n't told me a word about Sis , nor any of them STOP Now I 'll rest my works a little , and you start up yourn ; just tell me _everything_ -- tell me all about 'm all every one of 'm ; and how they are , and what they 're doing , and what they told you to tell me ; and every last thing you can think of STOP Well , I see I was up a stump -- and up it good STOP Providence had stood by me this fur all right , but I was hard and tight aground now STOP I see it war n't a bit of use to try to go ahead -- I 'd got to throw up my hand STOP So I says to myself , here 's another place where I got to resk the truth STOP I opened my mouth to begin ; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed , and says : Here he comes STOP Stick your head down lower -- there , that 'll do ; you can't be seen now STOP Do n't you let on you 're here STOP I 'll play a joke on him STOP Children , do n't you say a word STOP I see I was in a fix now STOP But it war n't no use to worry ; there warn't nothing to do but just hold still , and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck STOP I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in ; then the bed hid him STOP Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him , and says : Has he come STOP No , says her husband STOP Good-_ness_ gracious STOP she says , what in the warld can have become of him STOP I ca n't imagine , says the old gentleman ; and I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy STOP Uneasy STOP she says ; I 'm ready to go distracted STOP He _must_ a come ; and you 've missed him along the road STOP I _know_ it 's so -- something tells me so STOP Why , Sally , I _couldn't_ miss him along the road -- _you_ know that STOP But oh , dear , dear , what _will_ Sis say STOP He must a come STOP You must a missed him STOP He -- Oh , do n't distress me any more ' n I 'm already distressed STOP I do n't know what in the world to make of it STOP I 'm at my wit 's end , and I do n't mind acknowledging 't I 'm right down scared STOP But there 's no hope that he's come ; for he _couldn't_ come and me miss him STOP Sally , it 's terrible -- just terrible -- something 's happened to the boat , sure STOP Why , Silas STOP Look yonder ! -- up the road ! -- ai n't that somebody coming STOP He sprung to the window at the head of the bed , and that give Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted STOP She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull , and out I come ; and when he turned back from the window there she stood , a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire , and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside STOP The old gentleman stared , and says : Why , who 's that STOP Who do you reckon 't is STOP I hai n't no idea STOP Who _is_ it STOP It 's _Tom Sawyer ! _ By jings , I most slumped through the floor STOP But there war n't no time to swap knives ; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook , and kept on shaking ; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry ; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid , and Mary , and the rest of the tribe STOP But if they was joyful , it war n't nothing to what I was ; for it was like being born again , I was so glad to find out who I was STOP Well , they froze to me for two hours ; and at last , when my chin was so tired it couldn't hardly go any more , I had told them more about my family -- I mean the Sawyer family -- than ever happened to any six Sawyer families STOP And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White River , and it took us three days to fix it STOP Which was all right , and worked first-rate ; because _they_ did n't know but what it would take three days to fix it STOP If I 'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well STOP Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side , and pretty uncomfortable all up the other STOP Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable , and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river STOP Then I says to myself , s'pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat STOP And s'pose he steps in here any minute , and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet STOP Well , I could n't _have_ it that way ; it would n't do at all STOP I must go up the road and waylay him STOP So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage STOP The old gentleman was for going along with me , but I said no , I could drive the horse myself , and I druther he would n't take no trouble about me STOP STOP SO I started for town in the wagon , and when I was half-way I see a wagon coming , and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer , and I stopped and waited till he come along STOP I says Hold on STOP and it stopped alongside , and his mouth opened up like a trunk , and stayed so ; and he swallowed two or three times like a person that 's got a dry throat , and then says : I hai n't ever done you no harm STOP You know that STOP So , then , what you want to come back and ha'nt _me_ for STOP I says : I hai n't come back -- I hai n't been _gone_ STOP When he heard my voice it righted him up some , but he war n't quite satisfied yet STOP He says : Do n't you play nothing on me , because I would n't on you STOP Honest injun now , you ai n't a ghost STOP Honest injun , I ai n't , I says STOP Well -- I -- I -- well , that ought to settle it , of course ; but I ca n't somehow seem to understand it no way STOP Looky here , war n't you ever murdered _at all ? _ No STOP I war n't ever murdered at all -- I played it on them STOP You come in here and feel of me if you do n't believe me STOP So he done it ; and it satisfied him ; and he was that glad to see me again he did n't know what to do STOP And he wanted to know all about it right off , because it was a grand adventure , and mysterious , and so it hit him where he lived STOP But I said , leave it alone till by and by ; and told his driver to wait , and we drove off a little piece , and I told him the kind of a fix I was in , and what did he reckon we better do STOP He said , let him alone a minute , and do n't disturb him STOP So he thought and thought , and pretty soon he says : It 's all right ; I 've got it STOP Take my trunk in your wagon , and let on it 's your ' n ; and you turn back and fool along slow , so as to get to the house about the time you ought to ; and I 'll go towards town a piece , and take a fresh start , and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you ; and you need n't let on to know me at first STOP I says : All right ; but wait a minute STOP There 's one more thing -- a thing that _nobody_ do n't know but me STOP And that is , there 's a nigger here that I 'm a-trying to steal out of slavery , and his name is _Jim_ -- old Miss Watson 's Jim STOP He says : What STOP Why , Jim is -- He stopped and went to studying STOP I says : I know what you 'll say STOP You 'll say it 's dirty , low-down business ; but what if it is STOP I 'm low down ; and I 'm a-going to steal him , and I want you keep mum and not let on STOP Will you STOP His eye lit up , and he says : I 'll _help_ you steal him STOP Well , I let go all holts then , like I was shot STOP It was the most astonishing speech I ever heard -- and I 'm bound to say Tom Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation STOP Only I could n't believe it STOP Tom Sawyer a _nigger-stealer ! _ Oh , shucks STOP I says ; you 're joking STOP I ai n't joking , either STOP Well , then , I says , joking or no joking , if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger , do n't forget to remember that _you_ do n't know nothing about him , and I do n't know nothing about him STOP Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon , and he drove off his way and I drove mine STOP But of course I forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking ; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip STOP The old gentleman was at the door , and he says : Why , this is wonderful STOP Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it STOP I wish we 'd a timed her STOP And she hai n't sweated a hair -- not a hair STOP It 's wonderful STOP Why , I would n't take a hundred dollars for that horse now -- I would n't , honest ; and yet I 'd a sold her for fifteen before , and thought 't was all she was worth STOP That 's all he said STOP He was the innocentest , best old soul I ever see STOP But it war n't surprising ; because he war n't only just a farmer , he was a preacher , too , and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation , which he built it himself at his own expense , for a church and schoolhouse , and never charged nothing for his preaching , and it was worth it , too STOP There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that , and done the same way , down South STOP In about half an hour Tom 's wagon drove up to the front stile , and Aunt Sally she see it through the window , because it was only about fifty yards , and says : Why , there 's somebody come STOP I wonder who 't is STOP Why , I do believe it's a stranger STOP Jimmy ( that 's one of the children ) run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner STOP Everybody made a rush for the front door , because , of course , a stranger do n't come _every_ year , and so he lays over the yaller-fever , for interest , when he does come STOP Tom was over the stile and starting for the house ; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village , and we was all bunched in the front door STOP Tom had his store clothes on , and an audience -- and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer STOP In them circumstances it war n't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable STOP He war n't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep ; no , he come ca 'm and important , like the ram STOP When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty , like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he did n't want to disturb them , and says : Mr. Archibald Nichols , I presume STOP No , my boy , says the old gentleman , I 'm sorry to say 't your driver has deceived you ; Nichols 's place is down a matter of three mile more STOP Come in , come in STOP Tom he took a look back over his shoulder , and says , Too late -- he 's out of sight STOP Yes , he 's gone , my son , and you must come in and eat your dinner with us ; and then we 'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols 's STOP Oh , I _can't_ make you so much trouble ; I could n't think of it STOP I'll walk -- I do n't mind the distance STOP But we wo n't _let_ you walk -- it would n't be Southern hospitality to do it STOP Come right in STOP Oh , _do_ , says Aunt Sally ; it ai n't a bit of trouble to us , not a bit in the world STOP You must stay STOP It 's a long , dusty three mile , and we ca n't let you walk STOP And , besides , I 've already told 'em to put on another plate when I see you coming ; so you must n't disappoint us STOP Come right in and make yourself at home STOP So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome , and let himself be persuaded , and come in ; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from Hicksville , Ohio , and his name was William Thompson -- and he made another bow STOP Well , he run on , and on , and on , making up stuff about Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent , and I getting a little nervious , and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape ; and at last , still talking along , he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth , and then settled back again in his chair comfortable , and was going on talking ; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand , and says : You owdacious puppy STOP He looked kind of hurt , and says : I 'm surprised at you , m'am STOP You 're s'rp -- Why , what do you reckon I am STOP I 've a good notion to take and -- Say , what do you mean by kissing me STOP He looked kind of humble , and says : I did n't mean nothing , m'am STOP I did n't mean no harm STOP I -- I -- thought you'd like it STOP Why , you born fool STOP She took up the spinning stick , and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it STOP What made you think I 'd like it STOP Well , I do n't know STOP Only , they -- they -- told me you would STOP _They_ told you I would STOP Whoever told you 's _another_ lunatic STOP I never heard the beat of it STOP Who 's _they_ STOP Why , everybody STOP They all said so , m'am STOP It was all she could do to hold in ; and her eyes snapped , and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him ; and she says : Who 's 'everybody ' STOP Out with their names , or ther 'll be an idiot short STOP He got up and looked distressed , and fumbled his hat , and says : I 'm sorry , and I war n't expecting it STOP They told me to STOP They all told me to STOP They all said , kiss her ; and said she 'd like it STOP They all said it -- every one of them STOP But I 'm sorry , m'am , and I wo n't do it no more -- I wo n't , honest STOP You wo n't , wo n't you STOP Well , I sh 'd _reckon_ you wo n't STOP No 'm , I 'm honest about it ; I wo n't ever do it again -- till you ask me STOP Till I _ask_ you STOP Well , I never see the beat of it in my born days STOP I lay you 'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask you -- or the likes of you STOP Well , he says , it does surprise me so STOP I ca n't make it out , somehow STOP They said you would , and I thought you would STOP But -- He stopped and looked around slow , like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres , and fetched up on the old gentleman 's , and says , Didn't _you_ think she 'd like me to kiss her , sir STOP Why , no ; I -- I -- well , no , I b'lieve I did n't STOP Then he looks on around the same way to me , and says : Tom , did n't _you_ think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and say , 'Sid Sawyer -- ' My land STOP she says , breaking in and jumping for him , you impudent young rascal , to fool a body so -- and was going to hug him , but he fended her off , and says : No , not till you 've asked me first STOP So she did n't lose no time , but asked him ; and hugged him and kissed him over and over again , and then turned him over to the old man , and he took what was left STOP And after they got a little quiet again she says : Why , dear me , I never see such a surprise STOP We war n't looking for _you_ at all , but only Tom STOP Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him STOP It 's because it war n't _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom , he says ; but I begged and begged , and at the last minute she let me come , too ; so , coming down the river , me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first , and for me to by and by tag along and drop in , and let on to be a stranger STOP But it was a mistake , Aunt Sally STOP This ai n't no healthy place for a stranger to come STOP No -- not impudent whelps , Sid STOP You ought to had your jaws boxed ; I hai n't been so put out since I do n't know when STOP But I do n't care , I do n't mind the terms -- I 'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here STOP Well , to think of that performance STOP I do n't deny it , I was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack STOP We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen ; and there was things enough on that table for seven families -- and all hot , too ; none of your flabby , tough meat that 's laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning STOP Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it , but it was worth it ; and it did n't cool it a bit , neither , the way I 've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times STOP There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon , and me and Tom was on the lookout all the time ; but it war n't no use , they did n't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger , and we was afraid to try to work up to it STOP But at supper , at night , one of the little boys says : Pa , may n't Tom and Sid and me go to the show STOP No , says the old man , I reckon there ai n't going to be any ; and you could n't go if there was ; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me all about that scandalous show , and Burton said he would tell the people ; so I reckon they 've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time STOP So there it was ! -- but I could n't help it STOP Tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed ; so , being tired , we bid good-night and went up to bed right after supper , and clumb out of the window and down the lightning-rod , and shoved for the town ; for I did n't believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint , and so if I did n't hurry up and give them one they 'd get into trouble sure STOP On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered , and how pap disappeared pretty soon , and did n't come back no more , and what a stir there was when Jim run away ; and I told Tom all about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions , and as much of the raft voyage as I had time to ; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it -- it was as much as half-after eight , then -- here comes a raging rush of people with torches , and an awful whooping and yelling , and banging tin pans and blowing horns ; and we jumped to one side to let them go by ; and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail -- that is , I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke , though they was all over tar and feathers , and did n't look like nothing in the world that was human -- just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes STOP Well , it made me sick to see it ; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals , it seemed like I could n't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world STOP It was a dreadful thing to see STOP Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another STOP We see we was too late -- could n't do no good STOP We asked some stragglers about it , and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent ; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage ; then somebody give a signal , and the house rose up and went for them STOP So we poked along back home , and I war n't feeling so brash as I was before , but kind of ornery , and humble , and to blame , somehow -- though I had n't done nothing STOP But that 's always the way ; it do n't make no difference whether you do right or wrong , a person 's conscience ain't got no sense , and just goes for him anyway STOP If I had a yaller dog that did n't know no more than a person 's conscience does I would pison him STOP It takes up more room than all the rest of a person 's insides , and yet ai n't no good , nohow STOP Tom Sawyer he says the same STOP STOP WE stopped talking , and got to thinking STOP By and by Tom says : Looky here , Huck , what fools we are to not think of it before STOP I bet I know where Jim is STOP No STOP Where STOP In that hut down by the ash-hopper STOP Why , looky here STOP When we was at dinner , did n't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles STOP Yes STOP What did you think the vittles was for STOP For a dog STOP So 'd I STOP Well , it was n't for a dog STOP Why STOP Because part of it was watermelon STOP So it was -- I noticed it STOP Well , it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon STOP It shows how a body can see and do n't see at the same time STOP Well , the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in , and he locked it again when he came out STOP He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table -- same key , I bet STOP Watermelon shows man , lock shows prisoner ; and it ai n't likely there 's two prisoners on such a little plantation , and where the people 's all so kind and good STOP Jim 's the prisoner STOP All right -- I 'm glad we found it out detective fashion ; I would n't give shucks for any other way STOP Now you work your mind , and study out a plan to steal Jim , and I will study out one , too ; and we 'll take the one we like the best STOP What a head for just a boy to have STOP If I had Tom Sawyer 's head I would n't trade it off to be a duke , nor mate of a steamboat , nor clown in a circus , nor nothing I can think of STOP I went to thinking out a plan , but only just to be doing something ; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from STOP Pretty soon Tom says : Ready STOP Yes , I says STOP All right -- bring it out STOP My plan is this , I says STOP We can easy find out if it 's Jim in there STOP Then get up my canoe to-morrow night , and fetch my raft over from the island STOP Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man 's britches after he goes to bed , and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim , hiding daytimes and running nights , the way me and Jim used to do before STOP Would n't that plan work STOP _Work_ STOP Why , cert'nly it would work , like rats a-fighting STOP But it's too blame ' simple ; there ai n't nothing _to_ it STOP What 's the good of a plan that ai n't no more trouble than that STOP It 's as mild as goose-milk STOP Why , Huck , it would n't make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory STOP I never said nothing , because I war n't expecting nothing different ; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn't have none of them objections to it STOP And it did n't STOP He told me what it was , and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style , and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would , and maybe get us all killed besides STOP So I was satisfied , and said we would waltz in on it STOP I need n't tell what it was here , because I knowed it would n't stay the way , it was STOP I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along , and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance STOP And that is what he done STOP Well , one thing was dead sure , and that was that Tom Sawyer was in earnest , and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery STOP That was the thing that was too many for me STOP Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up ; and had a character to lose ; and folks at home that had characters ; and he was bright and not leather-headed ; and knowing and not ignorant ; and not mean , but kind ; and yet here he was , without any more pride , or rightness , or feeling , than to stoop to this business , and make himself a shame , and his family a shame , before everybody STOP I _couldn't_ understand it no way at all STOP It was outrageous , and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so ; and so be his true friend , and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself STOP And I _did_ start to tell him ; but he shut me up , and says : Do n't you reckon I know what I 'm about STOP Do n't I generly know what I'm about STOP Yes STOP Did n't I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger STOP Yes STOP _Well_ , then STOP That 's all he said , and that 's all I said STOP It war n't no use to say any more ; because when he said he 'd do a thing , he always done it STOP But I could n't make out how he was willing to go into this thing ; so I just let it go , and never bothered no more about it STOP If he was bound to have it so , I could n't help it STOP When we got home the house was all dark and still ; so we went on down to the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it STOP We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do STOP They knowed us , and did n't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night STOP When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides ; and on the side I war n't acquainted with -- which was the north side -- we found a square window-hole , up tolerable high , with just one stout board nailed across it STOP I says : Here 's the ticket STOP This hole 's big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board STOP Tom says : It 's as simple as tit-tat-toe , three-in-a-row , and as easy as playing hooky STOP I should _hope_ we can find a way that 's a little more complicated than _that_ , Huck Finn STOP Well , then , I says , how 'll it do to saw him out , the way I done before I was murdered that time STOP That 's more _like_ , he says STOP It 's real mysterious , and troublesome , and good , he says ; but I bet we can find a way that 's twice as long STOP There ai n't no hurry ; le 's keep on looking around STOP Betwixt the hut and the fence , on the back side , was a lean-to that joined the hut at the eaves , and was made out of plank STOP It was as long as the hut , but narrow -- only about six foot wide STOP The door to it was at the south end , and was padlocked STOP Tom he went to the soap-kettle and searched around , and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with ; so he took it and prized out one of the staples STOP The chain fell down , and we opened the door and went in , and shut it , and struck a match , and see the shed was only built against a cabin and had n't no connection with it ; and there war n't no floor to the shed , nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow STOP The match went out , and so did we , and shoved in the staple again , and the door was locked as good as ever STOP Tom was joyful STOP He says ; Now we 're all right STOP We 'll _dig_ him out STOP It 'll take about a week STOP Then we started for the house , and I went in the back door -- you only have to pull a buckskin latch-string , they do n't fasten the doors -- but that war n't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer ; no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning-rod STOP But after he got up half way about three times , and missed fire and fell every time , and the last time most busted his brains out , he thought he 'd got to give it up ; but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck , and this time he made the trip STOP In the morning we was up at break of day , and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim -- if it _was_ Jim that was being fed STOP The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields ; and Jim 's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things ; and whilst the others was leaving , the key come from the house STOP This nigger had a good-natured , chuckle-headed face , and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread STOP That was to keep witches off STOP He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights , and making him see all kinds of strange things , and hear all kinds of strange words and noises , and he did n't believe he was ever witched so long before in his life STOP He got so worked up , and got to running on so about his troubles , he forgot all about what he 'd been a-going to do STOP So Tom says : What 's the vittles for STOP Going to feed the dogs STOP The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face , like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle , and he says : Yes , Mars Sid , A dog STOP Cur'us dog , too STOP Does you want to go en look at 'im STOP Yes STOP I hunched Tom , and whispers : You going , right here in the daybreak STOP _that_ war n't the plan STOP No , it war n't ; but it 's the plan _now_ STOP So , drat him , we went along , but I did n't like it much STOP When we got in we could n't hardly see anything , it was so dark ; but Jim was there , sure enough , and could see us ; and he sings out : Why , _Huck_ STOP En good _lan_ ' STOP ain ' dat Misto Tom STOP I just knowed how it would be ; I just expected it STOP I did n't know nothing to do ; and if I had I could n't a done it , because that nigger busted in and says : Why , de gracious sakes STOP do he know you genlmen STOP We could see pretty well now STOP Tom he looked at the nigger , steady and kind of wondering , and says : Does _who_ know us STOP Why , dis-yer runaway nigger STOP I do n't reckon he does ; but what put that into your head STOP What _put_ it dar STOP Didn ' he jis ' dis minute sing out like he knowed you STOP Tom says , in a puzzled-up kind of way : Well , that 's mighty curious STOP _Who_ sung out STOP _when_ did he sing out STOP _what_ did he sing out STOP And turns to me , perfectly ca 'm , and says , Did _you_ hear anybody sing out STOP Of course there war n't nothing to be said but the one thing ; so I says : No ; I ai n't heard nobody say nothing STOP Then he turns to Jim , and looks him over like he never see him before , and says : Did you sing out STOP No , sah , says Jim ; I hai n't said nothing , sah STOP Not a word STOP No , sah , I hai n't said a word STOP Did you ever see us before STOP No , sah ; not as I knows on STOP So Tom turns to the nigger , which was looking wild and distressed , and says , kind of severe : What do you reckon 's the matter with you , anyway STOP What made you think somebody sung out STOP Oh , it 's de dad-blame ' witches , sah , en I wisht I was dead , I do STOP Dey 's awluz at it , sah , en dey do mos ' kill me , dey sk'yers me so STOP Please to do n't tell nobody 'bout it sah , er ole Mars Silas he 'll scole me ; 'kase he say dey _ain't_ no witches STOP I jis ' wish to goodness he was heah now -- _den_ what would he say STOP I jis ' bet he couldn ' fine no way to git aroun ' it _dis_ time STOP But it 's awluz jis ' so ; people dat 's _sot_ , stays sot ; dey wo n't look into noth ' n'en fine it out f ' r deyselves , en when _you_ fine it out en tell um 'bout it , dey doan ' b'lieve you STOP Tom give him a dime , and said we would n't tell nobody ; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with ; and then looks at Jim , and says : I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger STOP If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away , I would n't give him up , I 'd hang him STOP And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good , he whispers to Jim and says : Do n't ever let on to know us STOP And if you hear any digging going on nights , it 's us ; we 're going to set you free STOP Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it ; then the nigger come back , and we said we 'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us to ; and he said he would , more particular if it was dark , because the witches went for him mostly in the dark , and it was good to have folks around then STOP STOP IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast , so we left and struck down into the woods ; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how to dig by , and a lantern makes too much , and might get us into trouble ; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that 's called fox-fire , and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place STOP We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds , and set down to rest , and Tom says , kind of dissatisfied : Blame it , this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be STOP And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan STOP There ai n't no watchman to be drugged -- now there _ought_ to be a watchman STOP There ai n't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to STOP And there 's Jim chained by one leg , with a ten-foot chain , to the leg of his bed : why , all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain STOP And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody ; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger , and do n't send nobody to watch the nigger STOP Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this , only there would n't be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg STOP Why , drat it , Huck , it 's the stupidest arrangement I ever see STOP You got to invent _all_ the difficulties STOP Well , we ca n't help it ; we got to do the best we can with the materials we 've got STOP Anyhow , there 's one thing -- there 's more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers , where there war n't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them , and you had to contrive them all out of your own head STOP Now look at just that one thing of the lantern STOP When you come down to the cold facts , we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern's resky STOP Why , we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to , I believe STOP Now , whilst I think of it , we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get STOP What do we want of a saw STOP What do we _want_ of it STOP Hai n't we got to saw the leg of Jim 's bed off , so as to get the chain loose STOP Why , you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off STOP Well , if that ai n't just like you , Huck Finn STOP You _can_ get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing STOP Why , hai n't you ever read any books at all ? -- Baron Trenck , nor Casanova , nor Benvenuto Chelleeny , nor Henri IV. , nor none of them heroes STOP Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that STOP No ; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two , and leave it just so , and swallow the sawdust , so it ca n't be found , and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal ca n't see no sign of it 's being sawed , and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound STOP Then , the night you 're ready , fetch the leg a kick , down she goes ; slip off your chain , and there you are STOP Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements , shin down it , break your leg in the moat -- because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short , you know -- and there 's your horses and your trusty vassles , and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle , and away you go to your native Langudoc , or Navarre , or wherever it is STOP It 's gaudy , Huck STOP I wish there was a moat to this cabin STOP If we get time , the night of the escape , we 'll dig one STOP I says : What do we want of a moat when we 're going to snake him out from under the cabin STOP But he never heard me STOP He had forgot me and everything else STOP He had his chin in his hand , thinking STOP Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head ; then sighs again , and says : No , it would n't do -- there ai n't necessity enough for it STOP For what STOP I says STOP Why , to saw Jim 's leg off , he says STOP Good land STOP I says ; why , there ai n't _no_ necessity for it STOP And what would you want to saw his leg off for , anyway STOP Well , some of the best authorities has done it STOP They could n't get the chain off , so they just cut their hand off and shoved STOP And a leg would be better still STOP But we got to let that go STOP There ai n't necessity enough in this case ; and , besides , Jim 's a nigger , and wouldn't understand the reasons for it , and how it 's the custom in Europe ; so we 'll let it go STOP But there 's one thing -- he can have a rope ladder ; we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough STOP And we can send it to him in a pie ; it 's mostly done that way STOP And I 've et worse pies STOP Why , Tom Sawyer , how you talk , I says ; Jim ai n't got no use for a rope ladder STOP He _has_ got use for it STOP How _you_ talk , you better say ; you don't know nothing about it STOP He 's _got_ to have a rope ladder ; they all do STOP What in the nation can he _do_ with it STOP _Do_ with it STOP He can hide it in his bed , ca n't he STOP That 's what they all do ; and _he's_ got to , too STOP Huck , you do n't ever seem to want to do anything that 's regular ; you want to be starting something fresh all the time STOP S'pose he _don't_ do nothing with it STOP ai n't it there in his bed , for a clew , after he 's gone STOP and do n't you reckon they 'll want clews STOP Of course they will STOP And you would n't leave them any STOP That would be a _pretty_ howdy-do , _wouldn't_ it STOP I never heard of such a thing STOP Well , I says , if it 's in the regulations , and he 's got to have it , all right , let him have it ; because I do n't wish to go back on no regulations ; but there 's one thing , Tom Sawyer -- if we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder , we 're going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally , just as sure as you 're born STOP Now , the way I look at it , a hickry-bark ladder do n't cost nothing , and do n't waste nothing , and is just as good to load up a pie with , and hide in a straw tick , as any rag ladder you can start ; and as for Jim , he ai n't had no experience , and so he do n't care what kind of a -- Oh , shucks , Huck Finn , if I was as ignorant as you I 'd keep still -- that 's what I 'D do STOP Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder STOP Why , it 's perfectly ridiculous STOP Well , all right , Tom , fix it your own way ; but if you 'll take my advice , you 'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline STOP He said that would do STOP And that gave him another idea , and he says : Borrow a shirt , too STOP What do we want of a shirt , Tom STOP Want it for Jim to keep a journal on STOP Journal your granny -- _Jim_ ca n't write STOP S'pose he _can't_ write -- he can make marks on the shirt , ca n't he , if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel-hoop STOP Why , Tom , we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one ; and quicker , too STOP _Prisoners_ do n't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens out of , you muggins STOP They _always_ make their pens out of the hardest , toughest , troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on ; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out , too , because they 've got to do it by rubbing it on the wall STOP _They_ would n't use a goose-quill if they had it STOP It ai n't regular STOP Well , then , what 'll we make him the ink out of STOP Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears ; but that 's the common sort and women ; the best authorities uses their own blood STOP Jim can do that ; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he 's captivated , he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window STOP The Iron Mask always done that , and it 's a blame ' good way , too STOP Jim ai n't got no tin plates STOP They feed him in a pan STOP That ai n't nothing ; we can get him some STOP Ca n't nobody _read_ his plates STOP That ai n't got anything to _do_ with it , Huck Finn STOP All _he's_ got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out STOP You do n't _have_ to be able to read it STOP Why , half the time you ca n't read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate , or anywhere else STOP Well , then , what 's the sense in wasting the plates STOP Why , blame it all , it ai n't the _prisoner's_ plates STOP But it 's _somebody's_ plates , ai n't it STOP Well , spos ' n it is STOP What does the _prisoner_ care whose -- He broke off there , because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing STOP So we cleared out for the house STOP Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line ; and I found an old sack and put them in it , and we went down and got the fox-fire , and put that in too STOP I called it borrowing , because that was what pap always called it ; but Tom said it warn't borrowing , it was stealing STOP He said we was representing prisoners ; and prisoners do n't care how they get a thing so they get it , and nobody do n't blame them for it , either STOP It ai n't no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with , Tom said ; it 's his right ; and so , as long as we was representing a prisoner , we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with STOP He said if we war n't prisoners it would be a very different thing , and nobody but a mean , ornery person would steal when he war n't a prisoner STOP So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy STOP And yet he made a mighty fuss , one day , after that , when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it ; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for STOP Tom said that what he meant was , we could steal anything we _needed_ STOP Well , I says , I needed the watermelon STOP But he said I didn't need it to get out of prison with ; there 's where the difference was STOP He said if I 'd a wanted it to hide a knife in , and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with , it would a been all right STOP So I let it go at that , though I could n't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon STOP Well , as I was saying , we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business , and nobody in sight around the yard ; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch STOP By and by he come out , and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk STOP He says : Everything 's all right now except tools ; and that 's easy fixed STOP Tools STOP I says STOP Yes STOP Tools for what STOP Why , to dig with STOP We ai n't a-going to _gnaw_ him out , are we STOP Ai n't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with STOP I says STOP He turns on me , looking pitying enough to make a body cry , and says : Huck Finn , did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels , and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with STOP Now I want to ask you -- if you got any reasonableness in you at all -- what kind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero STOP Why , they might as well lend him the key and done with it STOP Picks and shovels -- why , they would n't furnish 'em to a king STOP Well , then , I says , if we do n't want the picks and shovels , what do we want STOP A couple of case-knives STOP To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with STOP Yes STOP Confound it , it 's foolish , Tom STOP It do n't make no difference how foolish it is , it 's the _right_ way -- and it 's the regular way STOP And there ai n't no _other_ way , that ever I heard of , and I 've read all the books that gives any information about these things STOP They always dig out with a case-knife -- and not through dirt , mind you ; generly it 's through solid rock STOP And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks , and for ever and ever STOP Why , look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef , in the harbor of Marseilles , that dug himself out that way ; how long was _he_ at it , you reckon STOP I do n't know STOP Well , guess STOP I do n't know STOP A month and a half STOP _Thirty-seven year_ -- and he come out in China STOP _That's_ the kind STOP I wish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock STOP _Jim_ do n't know nobody in China STOP What 's _that_ got to do with it STOP Neither did that other fellow STOP But you 're always a-wandering off on a side issue STOP Why ca n't you stick to the main point STOP All right -- I do n't care where he comes out , so he _comes_ out ; and Jim do n't , either , I reckon STOP But there 's one thing , anyway -- Jim 's too old to be dug out with a case-knife STOP He wo n't last STOP Yes he will _last_ , too STOP You do n't reckon it 's going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation , do you STOP How long will it take , Tom STOP Well , we ca n't resk being as long as we ought to , because it mayn't take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans STOP He 'll hear Jim ai n't from there STOP Then his next move will be to advertise Jim , or something like that STOP So we ca n't resk being as long digging him out as we ought to STOP By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years ; but we ca n't STOP Things being so uncertain , what I recommend is this : that we really dig right in , as quick as we can ; and after that , we can _let on_ , to ourselves , that we was at it thirty-seven years STOP Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there 's an alarm STOP Yes , I reckon that 'll be the best way STOP Now , there 's _sense_ in that , I says STOP Letting on do n't cost nothing ; letting on ai n't no trouble ; and if it 's any object , I do n't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year STOP It would n't strain me none , after I got my hand in STOP So I 'll mosey along now , and smouch a couple of case-knives STOP Smouch three , he says ; we want one to make a saw out of STOP Tom , if it ai n't unregular and irreligious to sejest it , I says , there 's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house STOP He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like , and says : It ai n't no use to try to learn you nothing , Huck STOP Run along and smouch the knives -- three of them STOP So I done it STOP STOP AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning-rod , and shut ourselves up in the lean-to , and got out our pile of fox-fire , and went to work STOP We cleared everything out of the way , about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log STOP Tom said he was right behind Jim 's bed now , and we 'd dig in under it , and when we got through there could n't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there , because Jim 's counter-pin hung down most to the ground , and you 'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole STOP So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight ; and then we was dog-tired , and our hands was blistered , and yet you could n't see we 'd done anything hardly STOP At last I says : This ai n't no thirty-seven year job ; this is a thirty-eight year job , Tom Sawyer STOP He never said nothing STOP But he sighed , and pretty soon he stopped digging , and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking STOP Then he says : It ai n't no use , Huck , it ai n't a-going to work STOP If we was prisoners it would , because then we 'd have as many years as we wanted , and no hurry ; and we would n't get but a few minutes to dig , every day , while they was changing watches , and so our hands would n't get blistered , and we could keep it up right along , year in and year out , and do it right , and the way it ought to be done STOP But _we_ ca n't fool along ; we got to rush ; we ai n't got no time to spare STOP If we was to put in another night this way we 'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well -- could n't touch a case-knife with them sooner STOP Well , then , what we going to do , Tom STOP I 'll tell you STOP It ai n't right , and it ai n't moral , and I would n't like it to get out ; but there ai n't only just the one way : we got to dig him out with the picks , and _let on_ it 's case-knives STOP _Now_ you 're _talking_ STOP I says ; your head gets leveler and leveler all the time , Tom Sawyer , I says STOP Picks is the thing , moral or no moral ; and as for me , I do n't care shucks for the morality of it , nohow STOP When I start in to steal a nigger , or a watermelon , or a Sunday-school book , I ai n't no ways particular how it 's done so it 's done STOP What I want is my nigger ; or what I want is my watermelon ; or what I want is my Sunday-school book ; and if a pick 's the handiest thing , that 's the thing I 'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with ; and I do n't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther STOP Well , he says , there 's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this ; if it war n't so , I would n't approve of it , nor I would n't stand by and see the rules broke -- because right is right , and wrong is wrong , and a body ai n't got no business doing wrong when he ai n't ignorant and knows better STOP It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick , _without_ any letting on , because you do n't know no better ; but it would n't for me , because I do know better STOP Gim me a case-knife STOP He had his own by him , but I handed him mine STOP He flung it down , and says : Gim me a _case-knife_ STOP I did n't know just what to do -- but then I thought STOP I scratched around amongst the old tools , and got a pickaxe and give it to him , and he took it and went to work , and never said a word STOP He was always just that particular STOP Full of principle STOP So then I got a shovel , and then we picked and shoveled , turn about , and made the fur fly STOP We stuck to it about a half an hour , which was as long as we could stand up ; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it STOP When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod , but he could n't come it , his hands was so sore STOP At last he says : It ai n't no use , it ca n't be done STOP What you reckon I better do STOP Can't you think of no way STOP Yes , I says , but I reckon it ai n't regular STOP Come up the stairs , and let on it 's a lightning-rod STOP So he done it STOP Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house , for to make some pens for Jim out of , and six tallow candles ; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance , and stole three tin plates STOP Tom says it was n't enough ; but I said nobody would n't ever see the plates that Jim throwed out , because they 'd fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole -- then we could tote them back and he could use them over again STOP So Tom was satisfied STOP Then he says : Now , the thing to study out is , how to get the things to Jim STOP Take them in through the hole , I says , when we get it done STOP He only just looked scornful , and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea , and then he went to studying STOP By and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways , but there war n't no need to decide on any of them yet STOP Said we 'd got to post Jim first STOP That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten , and took one of the candles along , and listened under the window-hole , and heard Jim snoring ; so we pitched it in , and it did n't wake him STOP Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel , and in about two hours and a half the job was done STOP We crept in under Jim 's bed and into the cabin , and pawed around and found the candle and lit it , and stood over Jim awhile , and found him looking hearty and healthy , and then we woke him up gentle and gradual STOP He was so glad to see us he most cried ; and called us honey , and all the pet names he could think of ; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away , and clearing out without losing any time STOP But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be , and set down and told him all about our plans , and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm ; and not to be the least afraid , because we would see he got away , _sure_ STOP So Jim he said it was all right , and we set there and talked over old times awhile , and then Tom asked a lot of questions , and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him , and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat , and both of them was kind as they could be , Tom says : _Now_ I know how to fix it STOP We 'll send you some things by them STOP I said , Do n't do nothing of the kind ; it 's one of the most jackass ideas I ever struck ; but he never paid no attention to me ; went right on STOP It was his way when he 'd got his plans set STOP So he told Jim how we 'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other large things by Nat , the nigger that fed him , and he must be on the lookout , and not be surprised , and not let Nat see him open them ; and we would put small things in uncle 's coat-pockets and he must steal them out ; and we would tie things to aunt 's apron-strings or put them in her apron-pocket , if we got a chance ; and told him what they would be and what they was for STOP And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood , and all that STOP He told him everything STOP Jim he could n't see no sense in the most of it , but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him ; so he was satisfied , and said he would do it all just as Tom said STOP Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco ; so we had a right down good sociable time ; then we crawled out through the hole , and so home to bed , with hands that looked like they 'd been chawed STOP Tom was in high spirits STOP He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life , and the most intellectural ; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out ; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it STOP He said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year , and would be the best time on record STOP And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it STOP In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes , and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket STOP Then we went to the nigger cabins , and while I got Nat's notice off , Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim 's pan , and we went along with Nat to see how it would work , and it just worked noble ; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out ; and there war n't ever anything could a worked better STOP Tom said so himself STOP Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that 's always getting into bread , you know ; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first STOP And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light , here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim 's bed ; and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them , and there war n't hardly room in there to get your breath STOP By jings , we forgot to fasten that lean-to door STOP The nigger Nat he only just hollered Witches once , and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs , and begun to groan like he was dying STOP Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim 's meat , and the dogs went for it , and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door , and I knowed he 'd fixed the other door too STOP Then he went to work on the nigger , coaxing him and petting him , and asking him if he 'd been imagining he saw something again STOP He raised up , and blinked his eyes around , and says : Mars Sid , you 'll say I 's a fool , but if I did n't b'lieve I see most a million dogs , er devils , er some ' n , I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks STOP I did , mos ' sholy STOP Mars Sid , I _felt_ um -- I _felt_ um , sah ; dey was all over me STOP Dad fetch it , I jis ' wisht I could git my han 's on one er dem witches jis ' wunst -- on ' y jis ' wunst -- it 's all I 'd ast STOP But mos'ly I wisht dey 'd lem me 'lone , I does STOP Tom says : Well , I tell you what I think STOP What makes them come here just at this runaway nigger 's breakfast-time STOP It 's because they 're hungry ; that's the reason STOP You make them a witch pie ; that 's the thing for _you_ to do STOP But my lan ' , Mars Sid , how 's I gwyne to make 'm a witch pie STOP I doan' know how to make it STOP I hai n't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo ' STOP Well , then , I 'll have to make it myself STOP Will you do it , honey ? -- will you STOP I 'll wusshup de groun ' und ' yo ' foot , I will STOP All right , I 'll do it , seeing it 's you , and you 've been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger STOP But you got to be mighty careful STOP When we come around , you turn your back ; and then whatever we 've put in the pan , do n't you let on you see it at all STOP And do n't you look when Jim unloads the pan -- something might happen , I do n't know what STOP And above all , do n't you _handle_ the witch-things STOP _Hannel 'M_ , Mars Sid STOP What _is_ you a-talkin ' 'bout STOP I wouldn' lay de weight er my finger on um , not f ' r ten hund 'd thous ' n billion dollars , I would n't STOP STOP THAT was all fixed STOP So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile in the back yard , where they keep the old boots , and rags , and pieces of bottles , and wore-out tin things , and all such truck , and scratched around and found an old tin washpan , and stopped up the holes as well as we could , to bake the pie in , and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast , and found a couple of shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with , and dropped one of them in Aunt Sally 's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair , and t'other we stuck in the band of Uncle Silas 's hat , which was on the bureau , because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger's house this morning , and then went to breakfast , and Tom dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas 's coat-pocket , and Aunt Sally was n't come yet , so we had to wait a little while STOP And when she come she was hot and red and cross , and could n't hardly wait for the blessing ; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child 's head with her thimble with the other , and says : I 've hunted high and I 've hunted low , and it does beat all what _has_ become of your other shirt STOP My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things , and a hard piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough , and was shot across the table , and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm , and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop , and Tom he turned kinder blue around the gills , and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that , and I would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder STOP But after that we was all right again -- it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold STOP Uncle Silas he says : It 's most uncommon curious , I ca n't understand it STOP I know perfectly well I took it _off_ , because -- Because you hai n't got but one _on_ STOP Just _listen_ at the man STOP I know you took it off , and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering memory , too , because it was on the clo's-line yesterday -- I see it there myself STOP But it 's gone , that 's the long and the short of it , and you'll just have to change to a red flann ' l one till I can get time to make a new one STOP And it 'll be the third I 've made in two years STOP It just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts ; and whatever you do manage to _do_ with 'm all is more ' n I can make out STOP A body 'd think you _would_ learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life STOP I know it , Sally , and I do try all I can STOP But it ought n't to be altogether my fault , because , you know , I do n't see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they 're on me ; and I do n't believe I 've ever lost one of them _off_ of me STOP Well , it ai n't _your_ fault if you have n't , Silas ; you 'd a done it if you could , I reckon STOP And the shirt ai n't all that 's gone , nuther STOP Ther 's a spoon gone ; and _that_ ai n't all STOP There was ten , and now ther 's only nine STOP The calf got the shirt , I reckon , but the calf never took the spoon , _that's_ certain STOP Why , what else is gone , Sally STOP Ther 's six _candles_ gone -- that 's what STOP The rats could a got the candles , and I reckon they did ; I wonder they do n't walk off with the whole place , the way you 're always going to stop their holes and don't do it ; and if they war n't fools they 'd sleep in your hair , Silas -- _you'd_ never find it out ; but you ca n't lay the _spoon_ on the rats , and that I know STOP Well , Sally , I 'm in fault , and I acknowledge it ; I 've been remiss ; but I wo n't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes STOP Oh , I would n't hurry ; next year 'll do STOP Matilda Angelina Araminta _Phelps ! _ Whack comes the thimble , and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any STOP Just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage , and says : Missus , dey 's a sheet gone STOP A _sheet_ gone STOP Well , for the land 's sake STOP I 'll stop up them holes to-day , says Uncle Silas , looking sorrowful STOP Oh , _do_ shet up ! -- s'pose the rats took the _sheet_ STOP _where's_ it gone , Lize STOP Clah to goodness I hai n't no notion , Miss ' Sally STOP She wuz on de clo'sline yistiddy , but she done gone : she ain ' dah no mo ' now STOP I reckon the world _is_ coming to an end STOP I _never_ see the beat of it in all my born days STOP A shirt , and a sheet , and a spoon , and six can -- Missus , comes a young yaller wench , dey 's a brass cannelstick miss ' n STOP Cler out from here , you hussy , er I 'll take a skillet to ye STOP Well , she was just a-biling STOP I begun to lay for a chance ; I reckoned I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated STOP She kept a-raging right along , running her insurrection all by herself , and everybody else mighty meek and quiet ; and at last Uncle Silas , looking kind of foolish , fishes up that spoon out of his pocket STOP She stopped , with her mouth open and her hands up ; and as for me , I wished I was in Jeruslem or somewheres STOP But not long , because she says : It 's _just_ as I expected STOP So you had it in your pocket all the time ; and like as not you 've got the other things there , too STOP How 'd it get there STOP I reely do n't know , Sally , he says , kind of apologizing , or you know I would tell STOP I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before breakfast , and I reckon I put it in there , not noticing , meaning to put my Testament in , and it must be so , because my Testament ai n't in ; but I 'll go and see ; and if the Testament is where I had it , I 'll know I did n't put it in , and that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon , and -- Oh , for the land 's sake STOP Give a body a rest STOP Go 'long now , the whole kit and biling of ye ; and do n't come nigh me again till I 've got back my peace of mind STOP I 'D a heard her if she 'd a said it to herself , let alone speaking it out ; and I 'd a got up and obeyed her if I 'd a been dead STOP As we was passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat , and the shingle-nail fell out on the floor , and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf , and never said nothing , and went out STOP Tom see him do it , and remembered about the spoon , and says : Well , it ai n't no use to send things by _him_ no more , he ain't reliable STOP Then he says : But he done us a good turn with the spoon , anyway , without knowing it , and so we 'll go and do him one without _him_ knowing it -- stop up his rat-holes STOP There was a noble good lot of them down cellar , and it took us a whole hour , but we done the job tight and good and shipshape STOP Then we heard steps on the stairs , and blowed out our light and hid ; and here comes the old man , with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other , looking as absent-minded as year before last STOP He went a mooning around , first to one rat-hole and then another , till he 'd been to them all STOP Then he stood about five minutes , picking tallow-drip off of his candle and thinking STOP Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs , saying : Well , for the life of me I ca n't remember when I done it STOP I could show her now that I war n't to blame on account of the rats STOP But never mind -- let it go STOP I reckon it would n't do no good STOP And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs , and then we left STOP He was a mighty nice old man STOP And always is STOP Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon , but he said we 'd got to have it ; so he took a think STOP When he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do ; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming , and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side , and I slid one of them up my sleeve , and Tom says : Why , Aunt Sally , there ai n't but nine spoons _yet_ STOP She says : Go 'long to your play , and do n't bother me STOP I know better , I counted 'm myself STOP Well , I 've counted them twice , Aunty , and I ca n't make but nine STOP She looked out of all patience , but of course she come to count -- anybody would STOP I declare to gracious ther ' _ain't_ but nine STOP she says STOP Why , what in the world -- plague _take_ the things , I 'll count 'm again STOP So I slipped back the one I had , and when she got done counting , she says : Hang the troublesome rubbage , ther 's _ten_ now STOP and she looked huffy and bothered both STOP But Tom says : Why , Aunty , I do n't think there 's ten STOP You numskull , did n't you see me _count 'm ? _ I know , but -- Well , I 'll count 'm _again_ STOP So I smouched one , and they come out nine , same as the other time STOP Well , she _was_ in a tearing way -- just a-trembling all over , she was so mad STOP But she counted and counted till she got that addled she 'd start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes ; and so , three times they come out right , and three times they come out wrong STOP Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west ; and she said cle ' r out and let her have some peace , and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she 'd skin us STOP So we had the odd spoon , and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders , and Jim got it all right , along with her shingle nail , before noon STOP We was very well satisfied with this business , and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took , because he said _now_ she could n't ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life ; and would n't believe she 'd counted them right if she _did_ ; and said that after she 'd about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she 'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more STOP So we put the sheet back on the line that night , and stole one out of her closet ; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she did n't know how many sheets she had any more , and she did n't _care_ , and war n't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it , and would n't count them again not to save her life ; she druther die first STOP So we was all right now , as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles , by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting ; and as to the candlestick , it war n't no consequence , it would blow over by and by STOP But that pie was a job ; we had no end of trouble with that pie STOP We fixed it up away down in the woods , and cooked it there ; and we got it done at last , and very satisfactory , too ; but not all in one day ; and we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through , and we got burnt pretty much all over , in places , and eyes put out with the smoke ; because , you see , we did n't want nothing but a crust , and we could n't prop it up right , and she would always cave in STOP But of course we thought of the right way at last -- which was to cook the ladder , too , in the pie STOP So then we laid in with Jim the second night , and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together , and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with STOP We let on it took nine months to make it STOP And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods , but it would n't go into the pie STOP Being made of a whole sheet , that way , there was rope enough for forty pies if we 'd a wanted them , and plenty left over for soup , or sausage , or anything you choose STOP We could a had a whole dinner STOP But we did n't need it STOP All we needed was just enough for the pie , and so we throwed the rest away STOP We did n't cook none of the pies in the wash-pan -- afraid the solder would melt ; but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of , because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable , not on account of being any account , because they war n't , but on account of them being relicts , you know , and we snaked her out , private , and took her down there , but she failed on the first pies , because we did n't know how , but she come up smiling on the last one STOP We took and lined her with dough , and set her in the coals , and loaded her up with rag rope , and put on a dough roof , and shut down the lid , and put hot embers on top , and stood off five foot , with the long handle , cool and comfortable , and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at STOP But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along , for if that rope ladder would n't cramp him down to business I do n't know nothing what I'm talking about , and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time , too STOP Nat did n't look when we put the witch pie in Jim 's pan ; and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles ; and so Jim got everything all right , and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick , and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole STOP STOP MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job , and so was the saw ; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all STOP That 's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall STOP But he had to have it ; Tom said he 'd _got_ to ; there war n't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind , and his coat of arms STOP Look at Lady Jane Grey , he says ; look at Gilford Dudley ; look at old Northumberland STOP Why , Huck , s'pose it _is_ considerble trouble ? -- what you going to do ? -- how you going to get around it STOP Jim 's _got_ to do his inscription and coat of arms STOP They all do STOP Jim says : Why , Mars Tom , I hai n't got no coat o ' arm ; I hai n't got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt , en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat STOP Oh , you do n't understand , Jim ; a coat of arms is very different STOP Well , I says , Jim 's right , anyway , when he says he ai n't got no coat of arms , because he hai n't STOP I reckon I knowed that , Tom says , but you bet he 'll have one before he goes out of this -- because he 's going out _right_ , and there ain't going to be no flaws in his record STOP So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece , Jim a-making his ' n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon , Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms STOP By and by he said he'd struck so many good ones he did n't hardly know which to take , but there was one which he reckoned he 'd decide on STOP He says : On the scutcheon we 'll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base , a saltire _murrey_ in the fess , with a dog , couchant , for common charge , and under his foot a chain embattled , for slavery , with a chevron _vert_ in a chief engrailed , and three invected lines on a field _azure_ , with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented ; crest , a runaway nigger , _sable_ , with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister ; and a couple of gules for supporters , which is you and me ; motto , _Maggiore Fretta , Minore Otto._ Got it out of a book -- means the more haste the less speed STOP Geewhillikins , I says , but what does the rest of it mean STOP We ai n't got no time to bother over that , he says ; we got to dig in like all git-out STOP Well , anyway , I says , what 's _some_ of it STOP What 's a fess STOP A fess -- a fess is -- _you_ do n't need to know what a fess is STOP I 'll show him how to make it when he gets to it STOP Shucks , Tom , I says , I think you might tell a person STOP What 's a bar sinister STOP Oh , I do n't know STOP But he 's got to have it STOP All the nobility does STOP That was just his way STOP If it did n't suit him to explain a thing to you , he would n't do it STOP You might pump at him a week , it would n't make no difference STOP He 'd got all that coat of arms business fixed , so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work , which was to plan out a mournful inscription -- said Jim got to have one , like they all done STOP He made up a lot , and wrote them out on a paper , and read them off , so : 1 STOP Here a captive heart busted STOP 2 STOP Here a poor prisoner , forsook by the world and friends , fretted his sorrowful life STOP 3 STOP Here a lonely heart broke , and a worn spirit went to its rest , after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity STOP 4 STOP Here , homeless and friendless , after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity , perished a noble stranger , natural son of Louis XIV STOP Tom 's voice trembled whilst he was reading them , and he most broke down STOP When he got done he could n't no way make up his mind which one for Jim to scrabble on to the wall , they was all so good ; but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on STOP Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail , and he did n't know how to make letters , besides ; but Tom said he would block them out for him , and then he would n't have nothing to do but just follow the lines STOP Then pretty soon he says : Come to think , the logs ai n't a-going to do ; they do n't have log walls in a dungeon : we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock STOP We 'll fetch a rock STOP Jim said the rock was worse than the logs ; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he would n't ever get out STOP But Tom said he would let me help him do it STOP Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens STOP It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow , and did n't give my hands no show to get well of the sores , and we did n't seem to make no headway , hardly ; so Tom says : I know how to fix it STOP We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions , and we can kill two birds with that same rock STOP There 's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill , and we 'll smouch it , and carve the things on it , and file out the pens and the saw on it , too STOP It war n't no slouch of an idea ; and it war n't no slouch of a grindstone nuther ; but we allowed we 'd tackle it STOP It war n't quite midnight yet , so we cleared out for the mill , leaving Jim at work STOP We smouched the grindstone , and set out to roll her home , but it was a most nation tough job STOP Sometimes , do what we could , we could n't keep her from falling over , and she come mighty near mashing us every time STOP Tom said she was going to get one of us , sure , before we got through STOP We got her half way ; and then we was plumb played out , and most drownded with sweat STOP We see it war n't no use ; we got to go and fetch Jim STOP So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg , and wrapt it round and round his neck , and we crawled out through our hole and down there , and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing ; and Tom superintended STOP He could out-superintend any boy I ever see STOP He knowed how to do everything STOP Our hole was pretty big , but it war n't big enough to get the grindstone through ; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough STOP Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail , and set Jim to work on them , with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer , and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him , and then he could go to bed , and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it STOP Then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed-leg , and was ready for bed ourselves STOP But Tom thought of something , and says : You got any spiders in here , Jim STOP No , sah , thanks to goodness I hai n't , Mars Tom STOP All right , we 'll get you some STOP But bless you , honey , I doan ' _want_ none STOP I 's afeard un um STOP I jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun ' STOP Tom thought a minute or two , and says : It 's a good idea STOP And I reckon it 's been done STOP It _must_ a been done ;

but I reck ' n dey wouldn ' take no stock in a juice-harp STOP Yes they would _they_ do n't care what kind of music 't is STOP A jews-harp 's plenty good enough for a rat STOP All animals like music -- in a prison they dote on it STOP Specially , painful music ; and you ca n't get no other kind out of a jews-harp STOP It always interests them ; they come out to see what 's the matter with you STOP Yes , you 're all right ; you 're fixed very well STOP You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep , and early in the mornings , and play your jews-harp ; play 'The Last Link is Broken ' -- that 's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker ' n anything else ; and when you 've played about two minutes you 'll see all the rats , and the snakes , and spiders , and things begin to feel worried about you , and come STOP And they 'll just fairly swarm over you , and have a noble good time STOP Yes , _dey_ will , I reck ' n , Mars Tom , but what kine er time is _Jim_ havin ' STOP Blest if I kin see de pint STOP But I 'll do it ef I got to STOP I reck ' n I better keep de animals satisfied , en not have no trouble in de house STOP Tom waited to think it over , and see if there was n't nothing else ;

you want to water it with your tears STOP It 's the way they always do STOP Why , Mars Tom , I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man 's a _start'n_ one wid tears STOP That ai n't the idea STOP You _got_ to do it with tears STOP She 'll die on my han 's , Mars Tom , she sholy will ; kase I doan ' skasely ever cry STOP So Tom was stumped STOP But he studied it over , and then said Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion STOP He promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one , private , in Jim's coffee-pot , in the morning STOP Jim said he would jis ' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee ; and found so much fault with it , and with the work and bother of raising the mullen , and jews-harping the rats , and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things , on top of all the other work he had to do on pens , and inscriptions , and journals , and things , which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook , that Tom most lost all patience with him ; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself , and yet he did n't know enough to appreciate them , and they was just about wasted on him STOP So Jim he was sorry , and said he wouldn't behave so no more , and then me and Tom shoved for bed STOP STOP IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and fetched it down , and unstopped the best rat-hole , and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones ; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally 's bed STOP But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there , and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out , and they did ; and Aunt Sally she come in , and when we got back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain , and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her STOP So she took and dusted us both with the hickry , and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen , drat that meddlesome cub , and they warn't the likeliest , nuther , because the first haul was the pick of the flock STOP I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was STOP We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders , and bugs , and frogs , and caterpillars , and one thing or another ; and we like to got a hornet's nest , but we did n't STOP The family was at home STOP We did n't give it right up , but stayed with them as long as we could ; because we allowed we'd tire them out or they 'd got to tire us out , and they done it STOP Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places , and was pretty near all right again , but could n't set down convenient STOP And so we went for the snakes , and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes , and put them in a bag , and put it in our room , and by that time it was supper-time , and a rattling good honest day 's work : and hungry ? -- oh , no , I reckon not STOP And there war n't a blessed snake up there when we went back -- we didn't half tie the sack , and they worked out somehow , and left STOP But it didn't matter much , because they was still on the premises somewheres STOP So we judged we could get some of them again STOP No , there war n't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell STOP You 'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then ; and they generly landed in your plate , or down the back of your neck , and most of the time where you did n't want them STOP Well , they was handsome and striped , and there war n't no harm in a million of them ; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally ; she despised snakes , be the breed what they might , and she could n't stand them no way you could fix it ; and every time one of them flopped down on her , it did n't make no difference what she was doing , she would just lay that work down and light out STOP I never see such a woman STOP And you could hear her whoop to Jericho STOP You could n't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs STOP And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire STOP She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there had n't ever been no snakes created STOP Why , after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally war n't over it yet ; she warn't near over it ; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings STOP It was very curious STOP But Tom said all women was just so STOP He said they was made that way for some reason or other STOP We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way , and she allowed these lickings war n't nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them STOP I did n't mind the lickings , because they did n't amount to nothing ; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot STOP But we got them laid in , and all the other things ; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim 's was when they'd all swarm out for music and go for him STOP Jim did n't like the spiders , and the spiders did n't like Jim ; and so they 'd lay for him , and make it mighty warm for him STOP And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there war n't no room in bed for him , skasely ; and when there was , a body could n't sleep , it was so lively , and it was always lively , he said , because _they_ never all slept at one time , but took turn about , so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck , and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch , so he always had one gang under him , in his way , and t'other gang having a circus over him , and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over STOP He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner again , not for a salary STOP Well , by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape STOP The shirt was sent in early , in a pie , and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh ; the pens was made , the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone ; the bed-leg was sawed in two , and we had et up the sawdust , and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache STOP We reckoned we was all going to die , but did n't STOP It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see ; and Tom said the same STOP But as I was saying , we 'd got all the work done now , at last ; and we was all pretty much fagged out , too , but mainly Jim STOP The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger , but had n't got no answer , because there war n't no such plantation ; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers ; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers , and I see we had n't no time to lose STOP So Tom said , now for the nonnamous letters STOP What 's them STOP I says STOP Warnings to the people that something is up STOP Sometimes it 's done one way , sometimes another STOP But there 's always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle STOP When Louis XVI STOP was going to light out of the Tooleries , a servant-girl done it STOP It 's a very good way , and so is the nonnamous letters STOP We 'll use them both STOP And it's usual for the prisoner 's mother to change clothes with him , and she stays in , and he slides out in her clothes STOP We 'll do that , too STOP But looky here , Tom , what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that something 's up STOP Let them find it out for themselves -- it 's their lookout STOP Yes , I know ; but you ca n't depend on them STOP It 's the way they 've acted from the very start -- left us to do _everything_ STOP They 're so confiding and mullet-headed they do n't take notice of nothing at all STOP So if we do n't _give_ them notice there wo n't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us , and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat ; wo n't amount to nothing -- wo n't be nothing _to_ it STOP Well , as for me , Tom , that 's the way I 'd like STOP Shucks STOP he says , and looked disgusted STOP So I says : But I ai n't going to make no complaint STOP Any way that suits you suits me STOP What you going to do about the servant-girl STOP You 'll be her STOP You slide in , in the middle of the night , and hook that yaller girl 's frock STOP Why , Tom , that 'll make trouble next morning ; because , of course , she prob'bly hai n't got any but that one STOP I know ; but you do n't want it but fifteen minutes , to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door STOP All right , then , I 'll do it ; but I could carry it just as handy in my own togs STOP You would n't look like a servant-girl _then_ , would you STOP No , but there wo n't be nobody to see what I look like , _anyway_ STOP That ai n't got nothing to do with it STOP The thing for us to do is just to do our _duty_ , and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or not STOP Hai n't you got no principle at all STOP All right , I ai n't saying nothing ; I 'm the servant-girl STOP Who 's Jim's mother STOP I 'm his mother STOP I 'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally STOP Well , then , you 'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves STOP Not much STOP I 'll stuff Jim 's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise , and Jim 'll take the nigger woman's gown off of me and wear it , and we 'll all evade together STOP When a prisoner of style escapes it 's called an evasion STOP It 's always called so when a king escapes , f'rinstance STOP And the same with a king 's son ; it do n't make no difference whether he 's a natural one or an unnatural one STOP So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter , and I smouched the yaller wench's frock that night , and put it on , and shoved it under the front door , the way Tom told me to STOP It said : Beware STOP Trouble is brewing STOP Keep a sharp lookout STOP _Unknown_ _Friend_ STOP Next night we stuck a picture , which Tom drawed in blood , of a skull and crossbones on the front door ; and next night another one of a coffin on the back door STOP I never see a family in such a sweat STOP They could n't a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air STOP If a door banged , Aunt Sally she jumped and said ouch STOP if anything fell , she jumped and said ouch STOP if you happened to touch her , when she war n't noticing , she done the same ; she could n't face noway and be satisfied , because she allowed there was something behind her every time -- so she was always a-whirling around sudden , and saying ouch , and before she 'd got two-thirds around she 'd whirl back again , and say it again ; and she was afraid to go to bed , but she das n't set up STOP So the thing was working very well , Tom said ; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory STOP He said it showed it was done right STOP So he said , now for the grand bulge STOP So the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready , and was wondering what we better do with it , because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night STOP Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spy around ; and the nigger at the back door was asleep , and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back STOP This letter said : Do n't betray me , I wish to be your friend STOP There is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway nigger to-night , and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them STOP I am one of the gang , but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again , and will betray the helish design STOP They will sneak down from northards , along the fence , at midnight exact , with a false key , and go in the nigger 's cabin to get him STOP I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger ; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all ; then whilst they are getting his chains loose , you slip there and lock them in , and can kill them at your leasure STOP Do n't do anything but just the way I am telling you , if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo STOP I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing STOP _Unknown Friend._ STOP WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast , and took my canoe and went over the river a-fishing , with a lunch , and had a good time , and took a look at the raft and found her all right , and got home late to supper , and found them in such a sweat and worry they did n't know which end they was standing on , and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper , and would n't tell us what the trouble was , and never let on a word about the new letter , but did n't need to , because we knowed as much about it as anybody did , and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed , and got up about half-past eleven , and Tom put on Aunt Sally 's dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch , but says : Where 's the butter STOP I laid out a hunk of it , I says , on a piece of a corn-pone STOP Well , you _left_ it laid out , then -- it ai n't here STOP We can get along without it , I says STOP We can get along _with_ it , too , he says ; just you slide down cellar and fetch it STOP And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along STOP I 'll go and stuff the straw into Jim 's clothes to represent his mother in disguise , and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as you get there STOP So out he went , and down cellar went I STOP The hunk of butter , big as a person 's fist , was where I had left it , so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on , and blowed out my light , and started up stairs very stealthy , and got up to the main floor all right , but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle , and I clapped the truck in my hat , and clapped my hat on my head , and the next second she see me ; and she says : You been down cellar STOP Yes 'm STOP What you been doing down there STOP Noth ' n STOP _Noth ' n ! _ No 'm STOP Well , then , what possessed you to go down there this time of night STOP I do n't know 'm STOP You do n't _know_ STOP Do n't answer me that way STOP Tom , I want to know what you been _doing_ down there STOP I hai n't been doing a single thing , Aunt Sally , I hope to gracious if I have STOP I reckoned she 'd let me go now , and as a generl thing she would ; but I s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that war n't yard-stick straight ; so she says , very decided : You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come STOP You been up to something you no business to , and I lay I 'll find out what it is before I 'M done with you STOP So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room STOP My , but there was a crowd there STOP Fifteen farmers , and every one of them had a gun STOP I was most powerful sick , and slunk to a chair and set down STOP They was setting around , some of them talking a little , in a low voice , and all of them fidgety and uneasy , but trying to look like they war n't ; but I knowed they was , because they was always taking off their hats , and putting them on , and scratching their heads , and changing their seats , and fumbling with their buttons STOP I war n't easy myself , but I did n't take my hat off , all the same STOP I did wish Aunt Sally would come , and get done with me , and lick me , if she wanted to , and let me get away and tell Tom how we 'd overdone this thing , and what a thundering hornet's-nest we 'd got ourselves into , so we could stop fooling around straight off , and clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us STOP At last she come and begun to ask me questions , but I _couldn't_ answer them straight , I did n't know which end of me was up ; because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay for them desperadoes , and saying it war n't but a few minutes to midnight ; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal ; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions , and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared ; and the place getting hotter and hotter , and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears ; and pretty soon , when one of them says , I 'M for going and getting in the cabin _first_ and right _now_ , and catching them when they come , I most dropped ; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead , and Aunt Sally she see it , and turns white as a sheet , and says : For the land 's sake , what _is_ the matter with the child STOP He 's got the brain-fever as shore as you 're born , and they 're oozing out STOP And everybody runs to see , and she snatches off my hat , and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter , and she grabbed me , and hugged me , and says : Oh , what a turn you did give me STOP and how glad and grateful I am it ai n't no worse ; for luck 's against us , and it never rains but it pours , and when I see that truck I thought we 'd lost you , for I knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be if -- Dear , dear , whyd'nt you _tell_ me that was what you 'd been down there for , I would n't a cared STOP Now cler out to bed , and do n't lem me see no more of you till morning STOP I was up stairs in a second , and down the lightning-rod in another one , and shinning through the dark for the lean-to STOP I could n't hardly get my words out , I was so anxious ; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must jump for it now , and not a minute to lose -- the house full of men , yonder , with guns STOP His eyes just blazed ; and he says : No ! -- is that so STOP _ain't_ it bully STOP Why , Huck , if it was to do over again , I bet I could fetch two hundred STOP If we could put it off till -- Hurry STOP _Hurry_ STOP I says STOP Where 's Jim STOP Right at your elbow ; if you reach out your arm you can touch him STOP He 's dressed , and everything 's ready STOP Now we 'll slide out and give the sheep-signal STOP But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door , and heard them begin to fumble with the pad-lock , and heard a man say : I _told_ you we 'd be too soon ; they have n't come -- the door is locked STOP Here , I 'll lock some of you into the cabin , and you lay for 'em in the dark and kill 'em when they come ; and the rest scatter around a piece , and listen if you can hear 'em coming STOP So in they come , but could n't see us in the dark , and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed STOP But we got under all right , and out through the hole , swift but soft -- Jim first , me next , and Tom last , which was according to Tom 's orders STOP Now we was in the lean-to , and heard trampings close by outside STOP So we crept to the door , and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack , but could n't make out nothing , it was so dark ; and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further , and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first , and him last STOP So he set his ear to the crack and listened , and listened , and listened , and the steps a-scraping around out there all the time ; and at last he nudged us , and we slid out , and stooped down , not breathing , and not making the least noise , and slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file , and got to it all right , and me and Jim over it ; but Tom 's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail , and then he hear the steps coming , so he had to pull loose , which snapped the splinter and made a noise ; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out : Who 's that STOP Answer , or I 'll shoot STOP But we did n't answer ; we just unfurled our heels and shoved STOP Then there was a rush , and a _Bang , Bang , Bang ! _ and the bullets fairly whizzed around us STOP We heard them sing out : Here they are STOP They 've broke for the river STOP After 'em , boys , and turn loose the dogs STOP So here they come , full tilt STOP We could hear them because they wore boots and yelled , but we did n't wear no boots and did n't yell STOP We was in the path to the mill ; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by , and then dropped in behind them STOP They 'd had all the dogs shut up , so they would n't scare off the robbers ; but by this time somebody had let them loose , and here they come , making powwow enough for a million ; but they was our dogs ; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up ; and when they see it warn't nobody but us , and no excitement to offer them , they only just said howdy , and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering ; and then we up-steam again , and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill , and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied , and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river , but did n't make no more noise than we was obleeged to STOP Then we struck out , easy and comfortable , for the island where my raft was ; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank , till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out STOP And when we stepped on to the raft I says : _Now_ , old Jim , you 're a free man again , and I bet you wo n't ever be a slave no more STOP En a mighty good job it wuz , too , Huck STOP It 'uz planned beautiful , en it 'uz done beautiful ; en dey ai n't _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat 's mo' mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz STOP We was all glad as we could be , but Tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg STOP When me and Jim heard that we did n't feel so brash as what we did before STOP It was hurting him considerable , and bleeding ; so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke 's shirts for to bandage him , but he says : Gim me the rags ; I can do it myself STOP Do n't stop now ; do n't fool around here , and the evasion booming along so handsome ; man the sweeps , and set her loose STOP Boys , we done it elegant ! -- 'deed we did STOP I wish _we'd_ a had the handling of Louis XVI. , there would n't a been no 'Son of Saint Louis , ascend to heaven ! STOP wrote down in _his_ biography ; no , sir , we'd a whooped him over the _border_ -- that 's what we 'd a done with _him_ -- and done it just as slick as nothing at all , too STOP Man the sweeps -- man the sweeps STOP But me and Jim was consulting -- and thinking STOP And after we 'd thought a minute , I says : Say it , Jim STOP So he says : Well , den , dis is de way it look to me , Huck STOP Ef it wuz _him_ dat 'uz bein ' sot free , en one er de boys wuz to git shot , would he say , 'Go on en save me , nemmine 'bout a doctor f ' r to save dis one ? STOP Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer STOP Would he say dat STOP You _bet_ he would n't STOP _well_ , den , is _Jim_ gywne to say it STOP No , sah -- I doan ' budge a step out ' n dis place 'dout a _doctor_ , not if it 's forty year STOP I knowed he was white inside , and I reckoned he 'd say what he did say -- so it was all right now , and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor STOP He raised considerable row about it , but me and Jim stuck to it and would n't budge ; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself ; but we would n't let him STOP Then he give us a piece of his mind , but it did n't do no good STOP So when he sees me getting the canoe ready , he says : Well , then , if you 're bound to go , I 'll tell you the way to do when you get to the village STOP Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast , and make him swear to be silent as the grave , and put a purse full of gold in his hand , and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark , and then fetch him here in the canoe , in a roundabout way amongst the islands , and search him and take his chalk away from him , and do n't give it back to him till you get him back to the village , or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again STOP It 's the way they all do STOP So I said I would , and left , and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again STOP STOP THE doctor was an old man ; a very nice , kind-looking old man when I got him up STOP I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting yesterday afternoon , and camped on a piece of a raft we found , and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams , for it went off and shot him in the leg , and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it , nor let anybody know , because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks STOP Who is your folks STOP he says STOP The Phelpses , down yonder STOP Oh , he says STOP And after a minute , he says : How 'd you say he got shot STOP He had a dream , I says , and it shot him STOP Singular dream , he says STOP So he lit up his lantern , and got his saddle-bags , and we started STOP But when he sees the canoe he did n't like the look of her -- said she was big enough for one , but did n't look pretty safe for two STOP I says : Oh , you need n't be afeard , sir , she carried the three of us easy enough STOP What three STOP Why , me and Sid , and -- and -- and _the guns_ ; that 's what I mean STOP Oh , he says STOP But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her , and shook his head , and said he reckoned he 'd look around for a bigger one STOP But they was all locked and chained ; so he took my canoe , and said for me to wait till he come back , or I could hunt around further , or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to STOP But I said I did n't ; so I told him just how to find the raft , and then he started STOP I struck an idea pretty soon STOP I says to myself , spos ' n he ca n't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep 's tail , as the saying is STOP spos ' n it takes him three or four days STOP What are we going to do ? -- lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag STOP No , sir ; I know what _I'll_ do STOP I 'll wait , and when he comes back if he says he 's got to go any more I 'll get down there , too , if I swim ; and we 'll take and tie him , and keep him , and shove out down the river ; and when Tom 's done with him we 'll give him what it 's worth , or all we got , and then let him get ashore STOP So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep ; and next time I waked up the sun was away up over my head STOP I shot out and went for the doctor 's house , but they told me he 'd gone away in the night some time or other , and war n't back yet STOP Well , thinks I , that looks powerful bad for Tom , and I 'll dig out for the island right off STOP So away I shoved , and turned the corner , and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's stomach STOP He says : Why , _Tom ! _ Where you been all this time , you rascal STOP I hai n't been nowheres , I says , only just hunting for the runaway nigger -- me and Sid STOP Why , where ever did you go STOP he says STOP Your aunt 's been mighty uneasy STOP She need n't , I says , because we was all right STOP We followed the men and the dogs , but they outrun us , and we lost them ; but we thought we heard them on the water , so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over , but could n't find nothing of them ; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out ; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep , and never waked up till about an hour ago ; then we paddled over here to hear the news , and Sid 's at the post-office to see what he can hear , and I 'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us , and then we 're going home STOP So then we went to the post-office to get Sid ; but just as I suspicioned , he war n't there ; so the old man he got a letter out of the office , and we waited awhile longer , but Sid did n't come ; so the old man said , come along , let Sid foot it home , or canoe it , when he got done fooling around -- but we would ride STOP I could n't get him to let me stay and wait for Sid ; and he said there war n't no use in it , and I must come along , and let Aunt Sally see we was all right STOP When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both , and hugged me , and give me one of them lickings of hern that do n't amount to shucks , and said she 'd serve Sid the same when he come STOP And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers ' wives , to dinner ; and such another clack a body never heard STOP Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst ; her tongue was a-going all the time STOP She says : Well , Sister Phelps , I 've ransacked that-air cabin over , an ' I b'lieve the nigger was crazy STOP I says to Sister Damrell -- did n't I , Sister Damrell ? -- s ' I , he 's crazy , s ' I -- them 's the very words I said STOP You all hearn me : he 's crazy , s ' I ;

and flour , and candles , and candlesticks , and spoons , and the old warming-pan , and most a thousand things that I disremember now , and my new calico dress ; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day _and_ night , as I was a-telling you , and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them ; and here at the last minute , lo and behold you , they slides right in under our noses and fools us , and not only fools _us_ but the Injun Territory robbers too , and actuly gets _away_ with that nigger safe and sound , and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time STOP I tell you , it just bangs anything I ever _heard_ of STOP Why , _sperits_ could n't a done better and been no smarter STOP And I reckon they must a _been_ sperits -- because , _you_ know our dogs , and ther ' ai n't no better ;

but I says to myself , there 's my two poor boys asleep , 'way up stairs in that lonesome room , and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy 't I crep ' up there and locked 'em in STOP I _did_ STOP And anybody would STOP Because , you know , when you get scared that way , and it keeps running on , and getting worse and worse all the time , and your wits gets to addling , and you get to doing all sorts o ' wild things , and by and by you think to yourself , spos ' n I was a boy , and was away up there , and the door ai n't locked , and you -- She stopped , looking kind of wondering , and then she turned her head around slow , and when her eye lit on me -- I got up and took a walk STOP Says I to myself , I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little STOP So I done it STOP But I das n't go fur , or she 'd a sent for me STOP And when it was late in the day the people all went , and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and Sid , and the door was locked , and we wanted to see the fun , so we went down the lightning-rod , and both of us got hurt a little , and we did n't never want to try _that_ no more STOP And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before ; and then she said she 'd forgive us , and maybe it was all right enough anyway , and about what a body might expect of boys , for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see ; and so , as long as no harm had n't come of it , she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still , stead of fretting over what was past and done STOP So then she kissed me , and patted me on the head , and dropped into a kind of a brown study ; and pretty soon jumps up , and says : Why , lawsamercy , it 's most night , and Sid not come yet STOP What _has_ become of that boy STOP I see my chance ; so I skips up and says : I 'll run right up to town and get him , I says STOP No you wo n't , she says STOP You 'll stay right wher ' you are ; _one's_ enough to be lost at a time STOP If he ai n't here to supper , your uncle 'll go STOP Well , he war n't there to supper ; so right after supper uncle went STOP He come back about ten a little bit uneasy ; had n't run across Tom's track STOP Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy ; but Uncle Silas he said there war n't no occasion to be -- boys will be boys , he said , and you'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right STOP So she had to be satisfied STOP But she said she 'd set up for him a while anyway , and keep a light burning so he could see it STOP And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle , and tucked me in , and mothered me so good I felt mean , and like I could n't look her in the face ; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time , and said what a splendid boy Sid was , and didn't seem to want to ever stop talking about him ; and kept asking me every now and then if I reckoned he could a got lost , or hurt , or maybe drownded , and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead , and she not by him to help him , and so the tears would drip down silent , and I would tell her that Sid was all right , and would be home in the morning , sure ; and she would squeeze my hand , or maybe kiss me , and tell me to say it again , and keep on saying it , because it done her good , and she was in so much trouble STOP And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle , and says : The door ai n't going to be locked , Tom , and there 's the window and the rod ; but you 'll be good , _won't_ you STOP And you wo n't go STOP For _my_ sake STOP Laws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom , and was all intending to go ; but after that I would n't a went , not for kingdoms STOP But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind , so I slept very restless STOP And twice I went down the rod away in the night , and slipped around front , and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them ; and I wished I could do something for her , but I could n't , only to swear that I would n't never do nothing to grieve her any more STOP And the third time I waked up at dawn , and slid down , and she was there yet , and her candle was most out , and her old gray head was resting on her hand , and she was asleep STOP STOP THE old man was uptown again before breakfast , but could n't get no track of Tom ; and both of them set at the table thinking , and not saying nothing , and looking mournful , and their coffee getting cold , and not eating anything STOP And by and by the old man says : Did I give you the letter STOP What letter STOP The one I got yesterday out of the post-office STOP No , you did n't give me no letter STOP Well , I must a forgot it STOP So he rummaged his pockets , and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down , and fetched it , and give it to her STOP She says : Why , it 's from St. Petersburg -- it 's from Sis STOP I allowed another walk would do me good ; but I could n't stir STOP But before she could break it open she dropped it and run -- for she see something STOP And so did I STOP It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress ; and that old doctor ; and Jim , in _her_ calico dress , with his hands tied behind him ; and a lot of people STOP I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy , and rushed STOP She flung herself at Tom , crying , and says : Oh , he 's dead , he 's dead , I know he 's dead STOP And Tom he turned his head a little , and muttered something or other , which showed he war n't in his right mind ; then she flung up her hands , and says : He 's alive , thank God STOP And that 's enough STOP and she snatched a kiss of him , and flew for the house to get the bed ready , and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else , as fast as her tongue could go , every jump of the way STOP I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim ; and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house STOP The men was very huffy , and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the other niggers around there , so they would n't be trying to run away like Jim done , and making such a raft of trouble , and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights STOP But the others said , do n't do it , it would n't answer at all ; he ai n't our nigger , and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him , sure STOP So that cooled them down a little , because the people that 's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hai n't done just right is always the very ones that ai n't the most anxious to pay for him when they 've got their satisfaction out of him STOP They cussed Jim considerble , though , and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while , but Jim never said nothing , and he never let on to know me , and they took him to the same cabin , and put his own clothes on him , and chained him again , and not to no bed-leg this time , but to a big staple drove into the bottom log , and chained his hands , too , and both legs , and said he war n't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come , or he was sold at auction because he did n't come in a certain length of time , and filled up our hole , and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night , and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime ; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing , and then the old doctor comes and takes a look , and says : Do n't be no rougher on him than you 're obleeged to , because he ain't a bad nigger STOP When I got to where I found the boy I see I could n't cut the bullet out without some help , and he war n't in no condition for me to leave to go and get help ; and he got a little worse and a little worse , and after a long time he went out of his head , and would n't let me come a-nigh him any more , and said if I chalked his raft he 'd kill me , and no end of wild foolishness like that , and I see I could n't do anything at all with him ; so I says , I got to have _help_ somehow ; and the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he 'll help , and he done it , too , and done it very well STOP Of course I judged he must be a runaway nigger , and there I _was_ STOP and there I had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night STOP It was a fix , I tell you STOP I had a couple of patients with the chills , and of course I 'd of liked to run up to town and see them , but I das n't , because the nigger might get away , and then I 'd be to blame ; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail STOP So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning ; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller , and yet he was risking his freedom to do it , and was all tired out , too , and I see plain enough he 'd been worked main hard lately STOP I liked the nigger for that ; I tell you , gentlemen , a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars -- and kind treatment , too STOP I had everything I needed , and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home -- better , maybe , because it was so quiet ; but there I _was_ , with both of 'm on my hands , and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning ; then some men in a skiff come by , and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep ; so I motioned them in quiet , and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about , and we never had no trouble STOP And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep , too , we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on , and towed her over very nice and quiet , and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start STOP He ai n't no bad nigger , gentlemen ; that 's what I think about him STOP Somebody says : Well , it sounds very good , doctor , I 'm obleeged to say STOP Then the others softened up a little , too , and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn ; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him , too ; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him STOP Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well , and was deserving to have some notice took of it , and reward STOP So every one of them promised , right out and hearty , that they would n't cuss him no more STOP Then they come out and locked him up STOP I hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off , because they was rotten heavy , or could have meat and greens with his bread and water ; but they did n't think of it , and I reckoned it war n't best for me to mix in , but I judged I 'd get the doctor 's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I 'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me -- explanations , I mean , of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger STOP But I had plenty time STOP Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and all night , and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him STOP Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better , and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap STOP So I slips to the sick-room , and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash STOP But he was sleeping , and sleeping very peaceful , too ; and pale , not fire-faced the way he was when he come STOP So I set down and laid for him to wake STOP In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in , and there I was , up a stump again STOP She motioned me to be still , and set down by me , and begun to whisper , and said we could all be joyful now , because all the symptoms was first-rate , and he 'd been sleeping like that for ever so long , and looking better and peacefuller all the time , and ten to one he 'd wake up in his right mind STOP So we set there watching , and by and by he stirs a bit , and opened his eyes very natural , and takes a look , and says : Hello ! -- why , I 'm at _home_ STOP How 's that STOP Where 's the raft STOP It 's all right , I says STOP And _Jim_ STOP The same , I says , but could n't say it pretty brash STOP But he never noticed , but says : Good STOP Splendid STOP _Now_ we 're all right and safe STOP Did you tell Aunty STOP I was going to say yes ; but she chipped in and says : About what , Sid STOP Why , about the way the whole thing was done STOP What whole thing STOP Why , _the_ whole thing STOP There ai n't but one ; how we set the runaway nigger free -- me and Tom STOP Good land STOP Set the run -- What _is_ the child talking about STOP Dear , dear , out of his head again STOP _No_ , I ai n't out of my _head_ ; I know all what I 'm talking about STOP We _did_ set him free -- me and Tom STOP We laid out to do it , and we _done_ it STOP And we done it elegant , too STOP He 'd got a start , and she never checked him up , just set and stared and stared , and let him clip along , and I see it war n't no use for _me_ to put in STOP Why , Aunty , it cost us a power of work -- weeks of it -- hours and hours , every night , whilst you was all asleep STOP And we had to steal candles , and the sheet , and the shirt , and your dress , and spoons , and tin plates , and case-knives , and the warming-pan , and the grindstone , and flour , and just no end of things , and you ca n't think what work it was to make the saws , and pens , and inscriptions , and one thing or another , and you ca n't think _half_ the fun it was STOP And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things , and nonnamous letters from the robbers , and get up and down the lightning-rod , and dig the hole into the cabin , and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie , and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket -- Mercy sakes STOP -- and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on , for company for Jim ; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business , because the men come before we was out of the cabin , and we had to rush , and they heard us and let drive at us , and I got my share , and we dodged out of the path and let them go by , and when the dogs come they war n't interested in us , but went for the most noise , and we got our canoe , and made for the raft , and was all safe , and Jim was a free man , and we done it all by ourselves , and _wasn't_ it bully , Aunty STOP Well , I never heard the likes of it in all my born days STOP So it was _you_ , you little rapscallions , that 's been making all this trouble , and turned everybody 's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death STOP I 've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o ' you this very minute STOP To think , here I 've been , night after night , a -- _you_ just get well once , you young scamp , and I lay I 'll tan the Old Harry out o ' both o ' ye STOP But Tom , he _was_ so proud and joyful , he just _couldn't_ hold in , and his tongue just _went_ it -- she a-chipping in , and spitting fire all along , and both of them going it at once , like a cat convention ; and she says : _Well_ , you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_ , for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again -- Meddling with _who_ STOP Tom says , dropping his smile and looking surprised STOP With _who_ STOP Why , the runaway nigger , of course STOP Who 'd you reckon STOP Tom looks at me very grave , and says : Tom , did n't you just tell me he was all right STOP Has n't he got away STOP _Him_ STOP says Aunt Sally ; the runaway nigger STOP 'Deed he has n't STOP They 've got him back , safe and sound , and he 's in that cabin again , on bread and water , and loaded down with chains , till he 's claimed or sold STOP Tom rose square up in bed , with his eye hot , and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills , and sings out to me : They hai n't no _right_ to shut him up STOP SHOVE ! -- and do n't you lose a minute STOP Turn him loose STOP he ai n't no slave ; he 's as free as any cretur that walks this earth STOP What _does_ the child mean STOP I mean every word I _say_ , Aunt Sally , and if somebody do n't go , _I'll_ go STOP I 've knowed him all his life , and so has Tom , there STOP Old Miss Watson died two months ago , and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river , and _said_ so ; and she set him free in her will STOP Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for , seeing he was already free STOP Well , that _is_ a question , I must say ; and just like women STOP Why , I wanted the _adventure_ of it ; and I 'd a waded neck-deep in blood to -- goodness alive , _Aunt Polly ! _ If she war n't standing right there , just inside the door , looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie , I wish I may never STOP Aunt Sally jumped for her , and most hugged the head off of her , and cried over her , and I found a good enough place for me under the bed , for it was getting pretty sultry for us , seemed to me STOP And I peeped out , and in a little while Tom 's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles -- kind of grinding him into the earth , you know STOP And then she says : Yes , you _better_ turn y ' r head away -- I would if I was you , Tom STOP Oh , deary me STOP says Aunt Sally ; _Is_ he changed so STOP Why , that ain't _Tom_ , it 's Sid ; Tom 's -- Tom 's -- why , where is Tom STOP He was here a minute ago STOP You mean where 's Huck _Finn_ -- that 's what you mean STOP I reckon I hain't raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I _see_ him STOP That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do STOP Come out from under that bed , Huck Finn STOP So I done it STOP But not feeling brash STOP Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see -- except one , and that was Uncle Silas , when he come in and they told it all to him STOP It kind of made him drunk , as you may say , and he didn't know nothing at all the rest of the day , and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation , because the oldest man in the world could n't a understood it STOP So Tom 's Aunt Polly , she told all about who I was , and what ; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer -- she chipped in and says , Oh , go on and call me Aunt Sally , I'm used to it now , and 'tai n't no need to change -- that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it -- there war n't no other way , and I knowed he would n't mind , because it would be nuts for him , being a mystery , and he 'd make an adventure out of it , and be perfectly satisfied STOP And so it turned out , and he let on to be Sid , and made things as soft as he could for me STOP And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will ; and so , sure enough , Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free STOP and I couldn't ever understand before , until that minute and that talk , how he _could_ help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up STOP Well , Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and _Sid_ had come all right and safe , she says to herself : Look at that , now STOP I might have expected it , letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him STOP So now I got to go and trapse all the way down the river , eleven hundred mile , and find out what that creetur 's up to _this_ time , as long as I could n't seem to get any answer out of you about it STOP Why , I never heard nothing from you , says Aunt Sally STOP Well , I wonder STOP Why , I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by Sid being here STOP Well , I never got 'em , Sis STOP Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe , and says : You , Tom STOP Well -- _what_ STOP he says , kind of pettish STOP Do n't you what _me_ , you impudent thing -- hand out them letters STOP What letters STOP _Them_ letters STOP I be bound , if I have to take a-holt of you I 'll -- They 're in the trunk STOP There , now STOP And they 're just the same as they was when I got them out of the office STOP I hai n't looked into them , I hai n't touched them STOP But I knowed they 'd make trouble , and I thought if you war n't in no hurry , I 'd -- Well , you _do_ need skinning , there ai n't no mistake about it STOP And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming ; and I s'pose he -- No , it come yesterday ; I hai n't read it yet , but _it's_ all right , I've got that one STOP I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she had n't , but I reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to STOP So I never said nothing STOP CHAPTER THE LAST THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea , time of the evasion ? -- what it was he 'd planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before STOP And he said , what he had planned in his head from the start , if we got Jim out all safe , was for us to run him down the river on the raft , and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river , and then tell him about his being free , and take him back up home on a steamboat , in style , and pay him for his lost time , and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around , and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band , and then he would be a hero , and so would we STOP But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was STOP We had Jim out of the chains in no time , and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom , they made a heap of fuss over him , and fixed him up prime , and give him all he wanted to eat , and a good time , and nothing to do STOP And we had him up to the sick-room , and had a high talk ; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient , and doing it up so good , and Jim was pleased most to death , and busted out , and says : Dah , now , Huck , what I tell you ? -- what I tell you up dah on Jackson islan ' STOP I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas ' , en what 's de sign un it ; en I _tole_ you I ben rich wunst , en gwineter to be rich _agin_ ; en it's come true ; en heah she is STOP _dah_ , now STOP doan ' talk to _me_ -- signs is _signs_ , mine I tell you ; en I knowed jis ' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be rich agin as I 's a-stannin ' heah dis minute STOP And then Tom he talked along and talked along , and says , le 's all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit , and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns , over in the Territory , for a couple of weeks or two ; and I says , all right , that suits me , but I ai n't got no money for to buy the outfit , and I reckon I could n't get none from home , because it 's likely pap 's been back before now , and got it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up STOP No , he hai n't , Tom says ; it 's all there yet -- six thousand dollars and more ; and your pap hai n't ever been back since STOP Had n't when I come away , anyhow STOP Jim says , kind of solemn : He ai n't a-comin ' back no mo ' , Huck STOP I says : Why , Jim STOP Nemmine why , Huck -- but he ai n't comin ' back no mo STOP But I kept at him ; so at last he says : Doan ' you 'member de house dat was float ' n down de river , en dey wuz a man in dah , kivered up , en I went in en unkivered him and didn ' let you come in STOP Well , den , you kin git yo ' money when you wants it , kase dat wuz him STOP Tom 's most well now , and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard for a watch , and is always seeing what time it is , and so there ain't nothing more to write about , and I am rotten glad of it , because if I'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I would n't a tackled it , and ai n't a-going to no more STOP But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest , because Aunt Sally she 's going to adopt me and sivilize me , and I ca n't stand it STOP I been there before STOP THE END STOP YOURS TRULY , _HUCK FINN_ STOP End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , Complete , by Mark Twain ( Samuel Clemens STOP
