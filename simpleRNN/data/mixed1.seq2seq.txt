Folk lore , legends , myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages , for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic , marvelous and manifestly unreal . 
The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations . 
Yet the old-time fairy tale , having served for generations , may now be classed as `` historical '' in the children 's library ; for the time has come for a series of newer `` wonder tales '' in which the stereotyped genie , dwarf and fairy are eliminated , together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incident devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale . 
Modern education includes morality ; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder-tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident . 
[ Illustration ] Having this thought in mind , the story of `` The Wonderful Wizard of Oz '' was written solely to pleasure children of today . 
It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale , in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heart-aches and nightmares are left out . 
L. FRANK BAUM . 
Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies , with Uncle Henry , who was a farmer , and Aunt Em , who was the farmer 's wife . 
Their house was small , for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles . 
There were four walls , a floor and a roof , which made one room ; and this room contained a rusty looking cooking stove , a cupboard for the dishes , a table , three or four chairs , and the beds . 
Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner , and Dorothy a little bed in another corner . 
There was no garret at all , and no cellar -- except a small hole , dug in the ground , called a cyclone cellar , where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose , mighty enough to crush any building in its path . 
It was reached by a trap-door in the middle of the floor , from which a ladder led down into the small , dark hole . 
When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around , she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side . 
Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached the edge of the sky in all directions . 
The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass , with little cracks running through it . 
Even the grass was not green , for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere . 
Once the house had been painted , but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away , and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else . 
[ Illustration : `` _She caught Toto by the ear._ '' ] When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young , pretty wife . 
The sun and wind had changed her , too . 
They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray ; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips , and they were gray also . 
She was thin and gaunt , and never smiled , now . 
When Dorothy , who was an orphan , first came to her , Aunt Em had been so startled by the child 's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears ; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at . 
Uncle Henry never laughed . 
He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was . 
He was gray also , from his long beard to his rough boots , and he looked stern and solemn , and rarely spoke . 
It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh , and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings . 
Toto was not gray ; he was a little black dog , with long , silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny , wee nose . 
Toto played all day long , and Dorothy played with him , and loved him dearly . 
[ Illustration ] To-day , however , they were not playing . 
Uncle Henry sat upon the door-step and looked anxiously at the sky , which was even grayer than usual . 
Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms , and looked at the sky too . 
Aunt Em was washing the dishes . 
From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind , and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm . 
There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south , and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also . 
Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up . 
`` There 's a cyclone coming , Em , '' he called to his wife ; `` I 'll go look after the stock . '' 
Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept . 
Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door . 
One glance told her of the danger close at hand . 
`` Quick , Dorothy ! '' 
she screamed ; `` run for the cellar ! '' 
Toto jumped out of Dorothy 's arms and hid under the bed , and the girl started to get him . 
Aunt Em , badly frightened , threw open the trap-door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small , dark hole . 
Dorothy caught Toto at last , and started to follow her aunt . 
When she was half way across the room there came a great shriek from the wind , and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor . 
A strange thing then happened . 
The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air . 
Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon . 
The north and south winds met where the house stood , and made it the exact center of the cyclone . 
In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still , but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher , until it was at the very top of the cyclone ; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather . 
It was very dark , and the wind howled horribly around her , but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily . 
After the first few whirls around , and one other time when the house tipped badly , she felt as if she were being rocked gently , like a baby in a cradle . 
Toto did not like it . 
He ran about the room , now here , now there , barking loudly ; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen . 
Once Toto got too near the open trap-door , and fell in ; and at first the little girl thought she had lost him . 
But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole , for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall . 
She crept to the hole , caught Toto by the ear , and dragged him into the room again ; afterward closing the trap-door so that no more accidents could happen . 
Hour after hour passed away , and slowly Dorothy got over her fright ; but she felt quite lonely , and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf . 
At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again ; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened , she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring . 
At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed , and lay down upon it ; and Toto followed and lay down beside her . 
In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind , Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep . 
[ Illustration ] . 
The Council with The Munchkins . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] She was awakened by a shock , so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt . 
As it was , the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened ; and Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally . 
Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving ; nor was it dark , for the bright sunshine came in at the window , flooding the little room . 
She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door . 
The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her , her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw . 
The cyclone had set the house down , very gently -- for a cyclone -- in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty . 
There were lovely patches of green sward all about , with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits . 
Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand , and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes . 
A little way off was a small brook , rushing and sparkling along between green banks , and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry , gray prairies . 
While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights , she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen . 
They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to ; but neither were they very small . 
In fact , they seemed about as tall as Dorothy , who was a well-grown child for her age , although they were , so far as looks go , many years older . 
[ Illustration : `` _I am the Witch of the North._ '' ] Three were men and one a woman , and all were oddly dressed . 
They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads , with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved . 
The hats of the men were blue ; the little woman 's hat was white , and she wore a white gown that hung in plaits from her shoulders ; over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds . 
The men were dressed in blue , of the same shade as their hats , and wore well polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops . 
The men , Dorothy thought , were about as old as Uncle Henry , for two of them had beards . 
But the little woman was doubtless much older : her face was covered with wrinkles , her hair was nearly white , and she walked rather stiffly . 
When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the doorway , they paused and whispered among themselves , as if afraid to come farther . 
But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy , made a low bow and said , in a sweet voice , `` You are welcome , most noble Sorceress , to the land of the Munchkins . 
We are so grateful to you for having killed the wicked Witch of the East , and for setting our people free from bondage . '' 
[ Illustration ] Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder . 
What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress , and saying she had killed the wicked Witch of the East ? 
Dorothy was an innocent , harmless little girl , who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home ; and she had never killed anything in all her life . 
But the little woman evidently expected her to answer ; so Dorothy said , with hesitation , `` You are very kind ; but there must be some mistake . 
I have not killed anything . '' 
`` Your house did , anyway , '' replied the little old woman , with a laugh ; `` and that is the same thing . 
See ! '' 
she continued , pointing to the corner of the house ; `` there are her two toes , still sticking out from under a block of wood . '' 
Dorothy looked , and gave a little cry of fright . 
There , indeed , just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on , two feet were sticking out , shod in silver shoes with pointed toes . 
`` Oh , dear ! 
oh , dear ! '' 
cried Dorothy , clasping her hands together in dismay ; `` the house must have fallen on her . 
What ever shall we do ? '' 
`` There is nothing to be done , '' said the little woman , calmly . 
[ Illustration ] `` But who was she ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` She was the wicked Witch of the East , as I said , '' answered the little woman . 
`` She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years , making them slave for her night and day . 
Now they are all set free , and are grateful to you for the favour . '' 
`` Who are the Munchkins ? '' 
enquired Dorothy . 
`` They are the people who live in this land of the East , where the wicked Witch ruled . '' 
`` Are you a Munchkin ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` No ; but I am their friend , although I live in the land of the North . 
When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift messenger to me , and I came at once . 
I am the Witch of the North . '' 
`` Oh , gracious ! '' 
cried Dorothy ; `` are you a real witch ? '' 
`` Yes , indeed ; '' answered the little woman . 
`` But I am a good witch , and the people love me . 
I am not as powerful as the wicked Witch was who ruled here , or I should have set the people free myself . '' 
`` But I thought all witches were wicked , '' said the girl , who was half frightened at facing a real witch . 
`` Oh , no ; that is a great mistake . 
There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz , and two of them , those who live in the North and the South , are good witches . 
I know this is true , for I am one of them myself , and can not be mistaken . 
Those who dwelt in the East and the West were , indeed , wicked witches ; but now that you have killed one of them , there is but one wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz -- the one who lives in the West . '' 
`` But , '' said Dorothy , after a moment 's thought , `` Aunt Em has told me that the witches were all dead -- years and years ago . '' 
`` Who is Aunt Em ? '' 
inquired the little old woman . 
`` She is my aunt who lives in Kansas , where I came from . '' 
The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time , with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground . 
Then she looked up and said , `` I do not know where Kansas is , for I have never heard that country mentioned before . 
But tell me , is it a civilized country ? '' 
`` Oh , yes ; '' replied Dorothy . 
`` Then that accounts for it . 
In the civilized countries I believe there are no witches left ; nor wizards , nor sorceresses , nor magicians . 
But , you see , the Land of Oz has never been civilized , for we are cut off from all the rest of the world . 
Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us . '' 
`` Who are the Wizards ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` Oz himself is the Great Wizard , '' answered the Witch , sinking her voice to a whisper . 
`` He is more powerful than all the rest of us together . 
He lives in the City of Emeralds . '' 
Dorothy was going to ask another question , but just then the Munchkins , who had been standing silently by , gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying . 
[ Illustration ] `` What is it ? '' 
asked the little old woman ; and looked , and began to laugh . 
The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely and nothing was left but the silver shoes . 
`` She was so old , '' explained the Witch of the North , `` that she dried up quickly in the sun . 
That is the end of her . 
But the silver shoes are yours , and you shall have them to wear . '' 
She reached down and picked up the shoes , and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy . 
`` The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes , '' said one of the Munchkins ; `` and there is some charm connected with them ; but what it is we never knew . '' 
Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table . 
Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said , `` I am anxious to get back to my Aunt and Uncle , for I am sure they will worry about me . 
Can you help me find my way ? '' 
The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another , and then at Dorothy , and then shook their heads . 
`` At the East , not far from here , '' said one , `` there is a great desert , and none could live to cross it . '' 
`` It is the same at the South , '' said another , `` for I have been there and seen it . 
The South is the country of the Quadlings . '' 
`` I am told , '' said the third man , `` that it is the same at the West . 
And that country , where the Winkies live , is ruled by the wicked Witch of the West , who would make you her slave if you passed her way . '' 
`` The North is my home , '' said the old lady , `` and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this land of Oz . 
I 'm afraid , my dear , you will have to live with us . '' 
Dorothy began to sob , at this , for she felt lonely among all these strange people . 
Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins , for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also . 
As for the little old woman , she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose , while she counted `` one , two , three '' in a solemn voice . 
At once the cap changed to a slate , on which was written in big , white chalk marks : `` LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS . '' 
[ Illustration ] The little old woman took the slate from her nose , and , having read the words on it , asked , `` Is your name Dorothy , my dear ? '' 
`` Yes , '' answered the child , looking up and drying her tears . 
`` Then you must go to the City of Emeralds . 
Perhaps Oz will help you . '' 
`` Where is this City ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` It is exactly in the center of the country , and is ruled by Oz , the Great Wizard I told you of . '' 
`` Is he a good man ? '' 
enquired the girl , anxiously . 
`` He is a good Wizard . 
Whether he is a man or not I can not tell , for I have never seen him . '' 
`` How can I get there ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` You must walk . 
It is a long journey , through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible . 
However , I will use all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm . '' 
`` Wo n't you go with me ? '' 
pleaded the girl , who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend . 
`` No , I can not do that , '' she replied ; `` but I will give you my kiss , and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North . '' 
She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead . 
Where her lips touched the girl they left a round , shining mark , as Dorothy found out soon after . 
`` The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick , '' said the Witch ; `` so you can not miss it . 
When you get to Oz do not be afraid of him , but tell your story and ask him to help you . 
Good-bye , my dear . '' 
[ Illustration ] The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey , after which they walked away through the trees . 
The Witch gave Dorothy a friendly little nod , whirled around on her left heel three times , and straightway disappeared , much to the surprise of little Toto , who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone , because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by . 
But Dorothy , knowing her to be a witch , had expected her to disappear in just that way , and was not surprised in the least . 
How Dorothy saved the Scarecrow . 
[ Illustration ] When Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry . 
So she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread , which she spread with butter . 
She gave some to Toto , and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear , sparkling water . 
Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there . 
Dorothy went to get him , and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it , finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast . 
Then she went back to the house , and having helped herself and Toto to a good drink of the cool , clear water , she set about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds . 
Dorothy had only one other dress , but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed . 
It was gingham , with checks of white and blue ; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings , it was still a pretty frock . 
The girl washed herself carefully , dressed herself in the clean gingham , and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head . 
She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard , laying a white cloth over the top . 
Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were . 
`` They surely will never do for a long journey , Toto , '' she said . 
And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant . 
At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East . 
`` I wonder if they will fit me , '' she said to Toto . 
`` They would be just the thing to take a long walk in , for they could not wear out . '' 
She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones , which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her . 
Finally she picked up her basket . 
`` Come along , Toto , '' she said , `` we will go to the Emerald City and ask the great Oz how to get back to Kansas again . '' 
She closed the door , locked it , and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress . 
And so , with Toto trotting along soberly behind her , she started on her journey . 
There were several roads near by , but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow brick . 
Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald City , her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard , yellow roadbed . 
The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweet and Dorothy did not feel nearly as bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land . 
[ Illustration ] She was surprised , as she walked along , to see how pretty the country was about her . 
There were neat fences at the sides of the road , painted a dainty blue color , and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance . 
Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops . 
Once in a while she would pass a house , and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by ; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the wicked witch and setting them free from bondage . 
The houses of the Munchkins were odd looking dwellings , for each was round , with a big dome for a roof . 
All were painted blue , for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color . 
Towards evening , when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night , she came to a house rather larger than the rest . 
On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing . 
Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and the people were laughing and singing , while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts , pies and cakes , and many other good things to eat . 
The people greeted Dorothy kindly , and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them ; for this was the home of one of the richest Munchkins in the land , and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the wicked witch . 
Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin himself , whose name was Boq . 
Then she sat down upon a settee and watched the people dance . 
When Boq saw her silver shoes he said , `` You must be a great sorceress . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
asked the girl . 
`` Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the wicked witch . 
Besides , you have white in your frock , and only witches and sorceresses wear white . '' 
[ Illustration : `` _You must be a great sorceress._ '' ] `` My dress is blue and white checked , '' said Dorothy , smoothing out the wrinkles in it . 
`` It is kind of you to wear that , '' said Boq . 
`` Blue is the color of the Munchkins , and white is the witch color ; so we know you are a friendly witch . '' 
Dorothy did not know what to say to this , for all the people seemed to think her a witch , and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land . 
When she had tired watching the dancing , Boq led her into the house , where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it . 
The sheets were made of blue cloth , and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning , with Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her . 
She ate a hearty breakfast , and watched a wee Munchkin baby , who played with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused Dorothy . 
Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people , for they had never seen a dog before . 
`` How far is it to the Emerald City ? '' 
the girl asked . 
[ Illustration ] `` I do not know , '' answered Boq , gravely , `` for I have never been there . 
It is better for people to keep away from Oz , unless they have business with him . 
But it is a long way to the Emerald City , and it will take you many days . 
The country here is rich and pleasant , but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey . '' 
This worried Dorothy a little , but she knew that only the great Oz could help her get to Kansas again , so she bravely resolved not to turn back . 
She bade her friends good-bye , and again started along the road of yellow brick . 
When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest , and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down . 
There was a great cornfield beyond the fence , and not far away she saw a Scarecrow , placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn . 
Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow . 
Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw , with eyes , nose and mouth painted on it to represent a face . 
An old , pointed blue hat , that had belonged to some Munchkin , was perched on this head , and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes , worn and faded , which had also been stuffed with straw . 
On the feet were some old boots with blue tops , such as every man wore in this country , and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back . 
[ Illustration : `` _Dorothy gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow._ '' ] While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer , painted face of the Scarecrow , she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her . 
She thought she must have been mistaken , at first , for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink ; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way . 
Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it , while Toto ran around the pole and barked . 
`` Good day , '' said the Scarecrow , in a rather husky voice . 
`` Did you speak ? '' 
asked the girl , in wonder . 
`` Certainly , '' answered the Scarecrow ; `` how do you do ? '' 
`` I 'm pretty well , thank you , '' replied Dorothy , politely ; `` how do you do ? '' 
`` I 'm not feeling well , '' said the Scarecrow , with a smile , `` for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows . '' 
`` Ca n't you get down ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` No , for this pole is stuck up my back . 
If you will please take away the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you . '' 
Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole ; for , being stuffed with straw , it was quite light . 
`` Thank you very much , '' said the Scarecrow , when he had been set down on the ground . 
`` I feel like a new man . '' 
Dorothy was puzzled at this , for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak , and to see him bow and walk along beside her . 
`` Who are you ? '' 
asked the Scarecrow , when he had stretched himself and yawned , `` and where are you going ? '' 
`` My name is Dorothy , '' said the girl , `` and I am going to the Emerald City , to ask the great Oz to send me back to Kansas . '' 
`` Where is the Emerald City ? '' 
he enquired ; `` and who is Oz ? '' 
`` Why , do n't you know ? '' 
she returned , in surprise . 
`` No , indeed ; I do n't know anything . 
You see , I am stuffed , so I have no brains at all , '' he answered , sadly . 
[ Illustration ] `` Oh , '' said Dorothy ; `` I 'm awfully sorry for you . '' 
`` Do you think , '' he asked , `` If I go to the Emerald City with you , that the great Oz would give me some brains ? '' 
`` I can not tell , '' she returned ; `` but you may come with me , if you like . 
If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now . '' 
`` That is true , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` You see , '' he continued , confidentially , `` I do n't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed , because I can not get hurt . 
If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me , it does n't matter , for I cant feel it . 
But I do not want people to call me a fool , and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains , as yours is , how am I ever to know anything ? '' 
`` I understand how you feel , '' said the little girl , who was truly sorry for him . 
`` If you will come with me I 'll ask Oz to do all he can for you . '' 
`` Thank you , '' he answered , gratefully . 
They walked back to the road , Dorothy helped him over the fence , and they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City . 
Toto did not like this addition to the party , at first . 
He smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw , and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow . 
`` Do n't mind Toto , '' said Dorothy , to her new friend ; `` he never bites . '' 
`` Oh , I 'm not afraid , '' replied the Scarecrow , `` he ca n't hurt the straw . 
Do let me carry that basket for you . 
I shall not mind it , for I ca n't get tired . 
I 'll tell you a secret , '' he continued , as he walked along ; `` there is only one thing in the world I am afraid of . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
asked Dorothy ; `` the Munchkin farmer who made you ? '' 
`` No , '' answered the Scarecrow ; `` it 's a lighted match . '' 
. 
The Road through the Forest . 
[ Illustration ] After a few hours the road began to be rough , and the walking grew so difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow brick , which were here very uneven . 
Sometimes , indeed , they were broken or missing altogether , leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy walked around . 
As for the Scarecrow , having no brains he walked straight ahead , and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks . 
It never hurt him , however , and Dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again , while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap . 
[ Illustration ] The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back . 
There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees , and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became . 
At noon they sat down by the roadside , near a little brook , and Dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread . 
She offered a piece to the Scarecrow , but he refused . 
`` I am never hungry , '' he said ; `` and it is a lucky thing I am not . 
For my mouth is only painted , and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat , the straw I am stuffed with would come out , and that would spoil the shape of my head . '' 
Dorothy saw at once that this was true , so she only nodded and went on eating her bread . 
`` Tell me something about yourself , and the country you came from , '' said the Scarecrow , when she had finished her dinner . 
So she told him all about Kansas , and how gray everything was there , and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer land of Oz . 
The Scarecrow listened carefully , and said , `` I can not understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry , gray place you call Kansas . '' 
[ Illustration : `` _ ' I was only made yesterday , ' said the Scarecrow._ '' ] `` That is because you have no brains , '' answered the girl . 
`` No matter how dreary and gray our homes are , we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country , be it ever so beautiful . 
There is no place like home . '' 
The Scarecrow sighed . 
`` Of course I can not understand it , '' he said . 
`` If your heads were stuffed with straw , like mine , you would probably all live in the beautiful places , and then Kansas would have no people at all . 
It is fortunate for Kansas that you have brains . '' 
`` Wo n't you tell me a story , while we are resting ? '' 
asked the child . 
The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully , and answered , `` My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever . 
I was only made day before yesterday . 
What happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me . 
Luckily , when the farmer made my head , one of the first things he did was to paint my ears , so that I heard what was going on . 
There was another Munchkin with him , and the first thing I heard was the farmer saying , `` 'How do you like those ears ? ' 
`` 'They are n't straight , ' answered the other . 
`` 'Never mind , ' said the farmer ; 'they are ears just the same , ' which was true enough . 
`` 'Now I 'll make the eyes , ' said the farmer . 
So he painted my right eye , and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity , for this was my first glimpse of the world . 
`` 'That 's a rather pretty eye , ' remarked the Munchkin who was watching the farmer ; 'blue paint is just the color for eyes . ' 
`` ' I think I 'll make the other a little bigger , ' said the farmer ; and when the second eye was done I could see much better than before . 
Then he made my nose and my mouth ; but I did not speak , because at that time I did n't know what a mouth was for . 
I had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs ; and when they fastened on my head , at last , I felt very proud , for I thought I was just as good a man as anyone . 
`` 'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough , ' said the farmer ; 'he looks just like a man . ' 
`` 'Why , he is a man , ' said the other , and I quite agreed with him . 
The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield , and set me up on a tall stick , where you found me . 
He and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone . 
`` I did not like to be deserted this way ; so I tried to walk after them , but my feet would not touch the ground , and I was forced to stay on that pole . 
It was a lonely life to lead , for I had nothing to think of , having been made such a little while before . 
Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield , but as soon as they saw me they flew away again , thinking I was a Munchkin ; and this pleased me and made me feel that I was quite an important person . 
By and by an old crow flew near me , and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said , [ Illustration ] `` ' I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner . 
Any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw . ' 
Then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted . 
The other birds , seeing he was not harmed by me , came to eat the corn too , so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me . '' 
`` I felt sad at this , for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow after all ; but the old crow comforted me , saying : 'If you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them , and a better man than some of them . 
Brains are the only things worth having in this world , no matter whether one is a crow or a man . ' 
`` After the crows had gone I thought this over , and decided I would try hard to get some brains . 
By good luck , you came along and pulled me off the stake , and from what you say I am sure the great Oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City . '' 
`` I hope so , '' said Dorothy , earnestly , `` since you seem anxious to have them . '' 
`` Oh yes ; I am anxious , '' returned the Scarecrow . 
`` It is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool . '' 
[ Illustration ] `` Well , '' said the girl , `` let us go . '' 
And she handed the basket to the Scarecrow . 
There were no fences at all by the road side now , and the land was rough and untilled . 
Towards evening they came to a great forest , where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick . 
It was almost dark under the trees , for the branches shut out the daylight ; but the travellers did not stop , and went on into the forest . 
`` If this road goes in , it must come out , '' said the Scarecrow , `` and as the Emerald City is at the other end of the road , we must go wherever it leads us . '' 
`` Anyone would know that , '' said Dorothy . 
`` Certainly ; that is why I know it , '' returned the Scarecrow . 
`` If it required brains to figure it out , I never should have said it . '' 
After an hour or so the light faded away , and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness . 
Dorothy could not see at all , but Toto could , for some dogs see very well in the dark ; and the Scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day . 
So she took hold of his arm , and managed to get along fairly well . 
`` If you see any house , or any place where we can pass the night , '' she said , `` you must tell me ; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark . '' 
Soon after the Scarecrow stopped . 
`` I see a little cottage at the right of us , '' he said , `` built of logs and branches . 
Shall we go there ? '' 
`` Yes , indeed ; '' answered the child . 
`` I am all tired out . '' 
So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage , and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner . 
She lay down at once , and with Toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep . 
The Scarecrow , who was never tired , stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came . 
[ Illustration ] . 
The Rescue of the Tin Woodman [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] When Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had long been out chasing birds and squirrels . 
She sat up and looked around her . 
There was the Scarecrow , still standing patiently in his corner , waiting for her . 
`` We must go and search for water , '' she said to him . 
`` Why do you want water ? '' 
he asked . 
`` To wash my face clean after the dust of the road , and to drink , so the dry bread will not stick in my throat . '' 
`` It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh , '' said the Scarecrow , thoughtfully ; `` for you must sleep , and eat and drink . 
However , you have brains , and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly . '' 
They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water , where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast . 
She saw there was not much bread left in the basket , and the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything , for there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day . 
When she had finished her meal , and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick , she was startled to hear a deep groan near by . 
`` What was that ? '' 
she asked , timidly . 
`` I can not imagine , '' replied the Scarecrow ; `` but we can go and see . '' 
Just then another groan reached their ears , and the sound seemed to come from behind them . 
They turned and walked through the forest a few steps , when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees . 
She ran to the place , and then stopped short , with a cry of surprise . 
One of the big trees had been partly chopped through , and standing beside it , with an uplifted axe in his hands , was a man made entirely of tin . 
His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body , but he stood perfectly motionless , as if he could not stir at all . 
Dorothy looked at him in amazement , and so did the Scarecrow , while Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs , which hurt his teeth . 
`` Did you groan ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` Yes , '' answered the tin man ; `` I did . 
I 've been groaning for more than a year , and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me . '' 
`` What can I do for you ? '' 
she enquired , softly , for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke . 
[ Illustration ] `` Get an oil-can and oil my joints , '' he answered . 
`` They are rusted so badly that I can not move them at all ; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again . 
You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage . '' 
Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can , and then she returned and asked , anxiously , `` Where are your joints ? '' 
`` Oil my neck , first , '' replied the Tin Woodman . 
So she oiled it , and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely , and then the man could turn it himself . 
`` Now oil the joints in my arms , '' he said . 
And Dorothy oiled them and the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new . 
The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe , which he leaned against the tree . 
`` This is a great comfort , '' he said . 
`` I have been holding that axe in the air ever since I rusted , and I 'm glad to be able to put it down at last . 
Now , if you will oil the joints of my legs , I shall be all right once more . '' 
So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely ; and he thanked them again and again for his release , for he seemed a very polite creature , and very grateful . 
`` I might have stood there always if you had not come along , '' he said ; `` so you have certainly saved my life . 
How did you happen to be here ? '' 
`` We are on our way to the Emerald City , to see the great Oz , '' she answered , `` and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night . '' 
`` Why do you wish to see Oz ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I want him to send me back to Kansas ; and the Scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head , '' she replied . 
The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment . 
Then he said : `` Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart ? '' 
`` Why , I guess so , '' Dorothy answered ; `` it would be as easy as to give the Scarecrow brains . '' 
[ Illustration : `` _'This is a great comfort , ' said the Tin Woodman._ '' ] `` True , '' the Tin Woodman returned . 
`` So , if you will allow me to join your party , I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me . '' 
`` Come along , '' said the Scarecrow , heartily ; and Dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company . 
So the Tin Woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick . 
The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket . 
`` For , '' he said , `` if I should get caught in the rain , and rust again , I would need the oil-can badly . '' 
It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party , for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travellers could not pass . 
But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party . 
Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road . 
Indeed , he was obliged to call to her to help him up again . 
`` Why did n't you walk around the hole ? '' 
asked the Tin Woodman . 
`` I do n't know enough , '' replied the Scarecrow , cheerfully . 
`` My head is stuffed with straw , you know , and that is why I am going to Oz to ask him for some brains . '' 
`` Oh , I see ; '' said the Tin Woodman . 
`` But , after all , brains are not the best things in the world . '' 
`` Have you any ? '' 
enquired the Scarecrow . 
`` No , my head is quite empty , '' answered the Woodman ; `` but once I had brains , and a heart also ; so , having tried them both , I should much rather have a heart . '' 
`` And why is that ? '' 
asked the Scarecrow . 
`` I will tell you my story , and then you will know . '' 
So , while they were walking through the forest , the Tin Woodman told the following story : `` I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living . 
When I grew up I too became a wood-chopper , and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived . 
Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry , so that I might not become lonely . 
[ Illustration ] `` There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to love her with all my heart . 
She , on her part , promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her ; so I set to work harder than ever . 
But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone , for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework . 
So the old woman went to the wicked Witch of the East , and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage . 
Thereupon the wicked Witch enchanted my axe , and when I was chopping away at my best one day , for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible , the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg . 
`` This at first seemed a great misfortune , for I knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper . 
So I went to a tin-smith and had him make me a new leg out of tin . 
The leg worked very well , once I was used to it ; but my action angered the wicked Witch of the East , for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl . 
When I began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg . 
Again I went to the tinner , and again he made me a leg out of tin . 
After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms , one after the other ; but , nothing daunted , I had them replaced with tin ones . 
The wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head , and at first I thought that was the end of me . 
But the tinner happened to come along , and he made me a new head out of tin . 
`` I thought I had beaten the wicked Witch then , and I worked harder than ever ; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be . 
She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden , and made my axe slip again , so that it cut right through my body , splitting me into two halves . 
Once more the tinner came to my help and made me a body of tin , fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it , by means of joints , so that I could move around as well as ever . 
But , alas ! 
I had now no heart , so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl , and did not care whether I married her or not . 
I suppose she is still living with the old woman , waiting for me to come after her . 
[ Illustration ] `` My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped , for it could not cut me . 
There was only one danger -- that my joints would rust ; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it . 
However , there came a day when I forgot to do this , and , being caught in a rainstorm , before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted , and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me . 
It was a terrible thing to undergo , but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart . 
While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth ; but no one can love who has not a heart , and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one . 
If he does , I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her . '' 
Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the Tin Woodman , and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart . 
`` All the same , '' said the Scarecrow , `` I shall ask for brains instead of a heart ; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one . '' 
`` I shall take the heart , '' returned the Tin Woodman ; `` for brains do not make one happy , and happiness is the best thing in the world . '' 
Dorothy did not say anything , for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right , and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Em it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the Scarecrow no heart , or each got what he wanted . 
[ Illustration ] What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone , and another meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket . 
To be sure neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything , but she was not made of tin nor straw , and could not live unless she was fed . 
. 
The Cowardly Lion . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration : `` _You ought to be ashamed of yourself ! _ '' ] [ Illustration ] All this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods . 
The road was still paved with yellow brick , but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees , and the walking was not at all good . 
There were few birds in this part of the forest , for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine ; but now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees . 
These sounds made the little girl 's heart beat fast , for she did not know what made them ; but Toto knew , and he walked close to Dorothy's side , and did not even bark in return . 
`` How long will it be , '' the child asked of the Tin Woodman , `` before we are out of the forest ? '' 
`` I can not tell , '' was the answer , `` for I have never been to the Emerald City . 
But my father went there once , when I was a boy , and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country , although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful . 
But I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can , and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow , while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the good Witch 's kiss , and that will protect you from harm . '' 
`` But Toto ! '' 
said the girl , anxiously ; `` what will protect him ? '' 
`` We must protect him ourselves , if he is in danger , '' replied the Tin Woodman . 
Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar , and the next moment a great Lion bounded into the road . 
With one blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road , and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws . 
But , to the Lion 's surprise , he could make no impression on the tin , although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still . 
Little Toto , now that he had an enemy to face , ran barking toward the Lion , and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog , when Dorothy , fearing Toto would be killed , and heedless of danger , rushed forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could , while she cried out : `` Do n't you dare to bite Toto ! 
You ought to be ashamed of yourself , a big beast like you , to bite a poor little dog ! '' 
`` I did n't bite him , '' said the Lion , as he rubbed his nose with his paw where Dorothy had hit it . 
`` No , but you tried to , '' she retorted . 
`` You are nothing but a big coward . '' 
`` I know it , '' said the Lion , hanging his head in shame ; `` I 've always known it . 
But how can I help it ? '' 
`` I do n't know , I 'm sure . 
To think of your striking a stuffed man , like the poor Scarecrow ! '' 
`` Is he stuffed ? '' 
asked the Lion , in surprise , as he watched her pick up the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet , while she patted him into shape again . 
`` Of course he 's stuffed , '' replied Dorothy , who was still angry . 
`` That 's why he went over so easily , '' remarked the Lion . 
`` It astonished me to see him whirl around so . 
Is the other one stuffed , also ? '' 
`` No , '' said Dorothy , `` he 's made of tin . '' 
And she helped the Woodman up again . 
`` That 's why he nearly blunted my claws , '' said the Lion . 
`` When they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back . 
What is that little animal you are so tender of ? '' 
`` He is my dog , Toto , '' answered Dorothy . 
`` Is he made of tin , or stuffed ? '' 
asked the Lion . 
`` Neither . 
He 's a -- a -- a meat dog , '' said the girl . 
`` Oh . 
He 's a curious animal , and seems remarkably small , now that I look at him . 
No one would think of biting such a little thing except a coward like me , '' continued the Lion , sadly . 
`` What makes you a coward ? '' 
asked Dorothy , looking at the great beast in wonder , for he was as big as a small horse . 
[ Illustration ] `` It 's a mystery , '' replied the Lion . 
`` I suppose I was born that way . 
All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave , for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts . 
I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way . 
Whenever I 've met a man I 've been awfully scared ; but I just roared at him , and he has always run away as fast as he could go . 
If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me , I should have run myself -- I 'm such a coward ; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me , and of course I let them go . '' 
`` But that is n't right . 
The King of Beasts should n't be a coward , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` I know it , '' returned the Lion , wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail ; `` it is my great sorrow , and makes my life very unhappy . 
But whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast . '' 
`` Perhaps you have heart disease , '' said the Tin Woodman . 
`` It may be , '' said the Lion . 
`` If you have , '' continued the Tin Woodman , `` you ought to be glad , for it proves you have a heart . 
For my part , I have no heart ; so I can not have heart disease . '' 
`` Perhaps , '' said the Lion , thoughtfully , `` if I had no heart I should not be a coward . '' 
`` Have you brains ? '' 
asked the Scarecrow . 
`` I suppose so . 
I 've never looked to see , '' replied the Lion . 
`` I am going to the great Oz to ask him to give me some , '' remarked the Scarecrow , `` for my head is stuffed with straw . '' 
`` And I am going to ask him to give me a heart , '' said the Woodman . 
`` And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas , '' added Dorothy . 
`` Do you think Oz could give me courage ? '' 
asked the cowardly Lion . 
`` Just as easily as he could give me brains , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` Or give me a heart , '' said the Tin Woodman . 
`` Or send me back to Kansas , '' said Dorothy . 
`` Then , if you do n't mind , I 'll go with you , '' said the Lion , `` for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage . '' 
`` You will be very welcome , '' answered Dorothy , `` for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts . 
It seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily . '' 
`` They really are , '' said the Lion ; `` but that does n't make me any braver , and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy . '' 
So once more the little company set off upon the journey , the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy 's side . 
Toto did not approve this new comrade at first , for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the Lion 's great jaws ; but after a time he became more at ease , and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends . 
During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey . 
Once , indeed , the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road , and killed the poor little thing . 
This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy , for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature ; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret . 
These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw , and there they rusted . 
When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth , for his jaws were tightly rusted together . 
He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him , but she could not understand . 
The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong . 
But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy 's basket and oiled the Woodman 's jaws , so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before . 
[ Illustration ] `` This will serve me a lesson , '' said he , `` to look where I step . 
For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again , and crying rusts my jaw so that I can not speak . '' 
Thereafter he walked very carefully , with his eyes on the road , and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it , so as not to harm it . 
The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart , and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything . 
`` You people with hearts , '' he said , `` have something to guide you , and need never do wrong ; but I have no heart , and so I must be very careful . 
When Oz gives me a heart of course I need n't mind so much . '' 
. 
The Journey to The Great Oz . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest , for there were no houses near . 
The tree made a good , thick covering to protect them from the dew , and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely . 
She and Toto ate the last of their bread , and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast . 
`` If you wish , '' said the Lion , `` I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you . 
You can roast it by the fire , since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food , and then you will have a very good breakfast . '' 
`` Do n't ! 
please do n't , '' begged the Tin Woodman . 
`` I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer , and then my jaws would rust again . '' 
[ Illustration ] But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper , and no one ever knew what it was , for he did n't mention it . 
And the Scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy 's basket with them , so that she would not be hungry for a long time . 
She thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow , but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts . 
His padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket . 
But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket , for it enabled him to keep away from the fire , as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up . 
So he kept a good distance away from the flames , and only came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep . 
These kept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning . 
When it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City . 
This was to be an eventful day for the travellers . 
They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side . 
It was a very wide ditch , and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep , and there were many big , jagged rocks at the bottom . 
The sides were so steep that none of them could climb down , and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end . 
`` What shall we do ? '' 
asked Dorothy , despairingly . 
`` I have n't the faintest idea , '' said the Tin Woodman ; and the Lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful . 
But the Scarecrow said : `` We can not fly , that is certain ; neither can we climb down into this great ditch . 
Therefore , if we can not jump over it , we must stop where we are . '' 
`` I think I could jump over it , '' said the Cowardly Lion , after measuring the distance carefully in his mind . 
`` Then we are all right , '' answered the Scarecrow , `` for you can carry us all over on your back , one at a time . '' 
`` Well , I 'll try it , '' said the Lion . 
`` Who will go first ? '' 
`` I will , '' declared the Scarecrow ; `` for , if you found that you could not jump over the gulf , Dorothy would be killed , or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the rocks below . 
But if I am on your back it will not matter so much , for the fall would not hurt me at all . '' 
[ Illustration ] `` I am terribly afraid of falling , myself , '' said the Cowardly Lion , `` but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it . 
So get on my back and we will make the attempt . '' 
The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion 's back , and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down . 
`` Why do n't you run and jump ? '' 
asked the Scarecrow . 
`` Because that is n't the way we Lions do these things , '' he replied . 
Then giving a great spring , he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side . 
They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it , and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang across the ditch again . 
Dorothy thought she would go next ; so she took Toto in her arms and climbed on the Lion 's back , holding tightly to his mane with one hand . 
The next moment it seemed as if she was flying through the air ; and then , before she had time to think about it , she was safe on the other side . 
The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman , and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest , for his great leaps had made his breath short , and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long . 
[ Illustration ] They found the forest very thick on this side , and it looked dark and gloomy . 
After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick , silently wondering , each in his own mind , if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again . 
To add to their discomfort , they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest , and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived . 
`` What are the Kalidahs ? '' 
asked the girl . 
`` They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers , '' replied the Lion ; `` and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto . 
I'm terribly afraid of the Kalidahs . '' 
`` I 'm not surprised that you are , '' returned Dorothy `` They must be dreadful beasts . '' 
The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road ; but this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew at once he could not leap across it . 
So they sat down to consider what they should do , and after serious thought the Scarecrow said , `` Here is a great tree , standing close to the ditch . 
If the Tin Woodman can chop it down , so that it will fall to the other side , we can walk across it easily . '' 
`` That is a first rate idea , '' said the Lion . 
`` One would almost suspect you had brains in your head , instead of straw . '' 
The Woodman set to work at once , and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through . 
Then the Lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might , and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch , with its top branches on the other side . 
They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up , and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers . 
`` They are the Kalidahs ! '' 
said the Cowardly Lion , beginning to tremble . 
`` Quick ! '' 
cried the Scarecrow , `` let us cross over . '' 
[ Illustration : `` _The tree fell with a crash into the gulf._ '' ] So Dorothy went first , holding Toto in her arms ; the Tin Woodman followed , and the Scarecrow came next . 
The Lion , although he was certainly afraid , turned to face the Kalidahs , and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over backwards , while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise . 
But , seeing they were bigger than the Lion , and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him , the Kalidahs again rushed forward , and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next . 
Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree , and the Lion said to Dorothy , `` We are lost , for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws . 
But stand close behind me , and I will fight them as long as I am alive . '' 
`` Wait a minute ! '' 
called the Scarecrow . 
He had been thinking what was best to be done , and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch . 
The Tin Woodman began to use his axe at once , and , just as the two Kalidahs were nearly across , the tree fell with a crash into the gulf , carrying the ugly , snarling brutes with it , and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom . 
`` Well , '' said the Cowardly Lion , drawing a long breath of relief , `` I see we are going to live a little while longer , and I am glad of it , for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive . 
Those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet . '' 
`` Ah . '' 
said the Tin Woodman , sadly , `` I wish I had a heart to beat . '' 
[ Illustration ] This adventure made the travellers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest , and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired , and had to ride on the Lion 's back . 
To their great joy the trees became thinner the further they advanced , and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river , flowing swiftly just before them . 
On the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country , with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits . 
They were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them . 
`` How shall we cross the river ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` That is easily done , '' replied the Scarecrow . 
`` The Tin Woodman must build us a raft , so we can float to the other side . '' 
So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft , and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the river bank a tree full of fine fruit . 
This pleased Dorothy , who had eaten nothing but nuts all day , and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit . 
But it takes time to make a raft , even when one is as industrious and untiring as the Tin Woodman , and when night came the work was not done . 
So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning ; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City , and of the good Wizard Oz , who would soon send her back to her own home again . 
[ Illustration ] . 
The Deadly Poppy Field . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] Our little party of travellers awakened next morning refreshed and full of hope , and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river . 
Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through , although they had suffered many discouragements ; but before them was a lovely , sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City . 
To be sure , the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land ; but the raft was nearly done , and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins , they were ready to start . 
Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her arms . 
When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly , for he was big and heavy ; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it , and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water . 
They got along quite well at first , but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft down stream , farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick ; and the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom . 
`` This is bad , '' said the Tin Woodman , `` for if we can not get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the wicked Witch of the West , and she will enchant us and make us her slaves . '' 
`` And then I should get no brains , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` And I should get no courage , '' said the Cowardly Lion . 
[ Illustration ] `` And I should get no heart , '' said the Tin Woodman . 
`` And I should never get back to Kansas , '' said Dorothy . 
`` We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can , '' the Scarecrow continued , and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river , and before he could pull it out again , or let go , the raft was swept away and the poor Scarecrow left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river . 
`` Good bye ! '' 
he called after them , and they were very sorry to leave him ; indeed , the Tin Woodman began to cry , but fortunately remembered that he might rust , and so dried his tears on Dorothy 's apron . 
Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow . 
`` I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy , '' he thought . 
`` Then , I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield , where I could make believe scare the crows , at any rate ; but surely there is no use for a Scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river . 
I am afraid I shall never have any brains , after all ! '' 
[ Illustration ] Down the stream the raft floated , and the poor Scarecrow was left far behind . 
Then the Lion said : `` Something must be done to save us . 
I think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me , if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail . '' 
[ Illustration ] So he sprang into the water and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his tail , when the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore . 
It was hard work , although he was so big ; but by and by they were drawn out of the current , and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman 's long pole and helped push the raft to the land . 
They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass , and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City . 
`` What shall we do now ? '' 
asked the Tin Woodman , as the Lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him . 
`` We must get back to the road , in some way , '' said Dorothy . 
`` The best plan will be to walk along the river bank until we come to the road again , '' remarked the Lion . 
So , when they were rested , Dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank , back to the road from which the river had carried them . 
It was a lovely country , with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them , and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow they could have been very happy . 
They walked along as fast as they could , Dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower ; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out , `` Look ! '' 
Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water , looking very lonely and sad . 
`` What can we do to save him ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads , for they did not know . 
So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by , which , seeing them , stopped to rest at the water 's edge . 
`` Who are you , and where are you going ? '' 
asked the Stork . 
`` I am Dorothy , '' answered the girl ; `` and these are my friends , the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion ; and we are going to the Emerald City . '' 
`` This is n't the road , '' said the Stork , as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party . 
`` I know it , '' returned Dorothy , `` but we have lost the Scarecrow , and are wondering how we shall get him again . '' 
`` Where is he ? '' 
asked the Stork . 
`` Over there in the river , '' answered the girl . 
`` If he was n't so big and heavy I would get him for you , '' remarked the Stork . 
`` He is n't heavy a bit , '' said Dorothy , eagerly , `` for he is stuffed with straw ; and if you will bring him back to us we shall thank you ever and ever so much . '' 
`` Well , I 'll try , '' said the Stork ; `` but if I find he is too heavy to carry I shall have to drop him in the river again . '' 
So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole . 
Then the Stork with her great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank , where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto were sitting . 
When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again he was so happy that he hugged them all , even the Lion and Toto ; and as they walked along he sang `` Tol-de-ri-de-oh ! '' 
at every step , he felt so gay . 
`` I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever , '' he said , `` but the kind Stork saved me , and if I ever get any brains I shall find the Stork again and do it some kindness in return . '' 
`` That 's all right , '' said the Stork , who was flying along beside them . 
`` I always like to help anyone in trouble . 
But I must go now , for my babies are waiting in the nest for me . 
I hope you will find the Emerald City and that Oz will help you . '' 
`` Thank you , '' replied Dorothy , and then the kind Stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight . 
[ Illustration : `` _The Stork carried him up into the air._ '' ] They walked along listening to the singing of the bright-colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them . 
There were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms , besides great clusters of scarlet poppies , which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy 's eyes . 
`` Are n't they beautiful ? '' 
the girl asked , as she breathed in the spicy scent of the flowers . 
`` I suppose so , '' answered the Scarecrow . 
`` When I have brains I shall probably like them better . '' 
`` If I only had a heart I should love them , '' added the Tin Woodman . 
`` I always did like flowers , '' said the Lion ; `` they seem so helpless and frail . 
But there are none in the forest so bright as these . '' 
They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies , and fewer and fewer of the other flowers ; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies . 
Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep , and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever . 
But Dorothy did not know this , nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about ; so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep . 
But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this . 
`` We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark , '' he said ; and the Scarecrow agreed with him . 
So they kept walking until Dorothy could stand no longer . 
Her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies , fast asleep . 
`` What shall we do ? '' 
asked the Tin Woodman . 
`` If we leave her here she will die , '' said the Lion . 
`` The smell of the flowers is killing us all . 
I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open and the dog is asleep already . '' 
It was true ; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress . 
But the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman , not being made of flesh , were not troubled by the scent of the flowers . 
[ Illustration ] `` Run fast , '' said the Scarecrow to the Lion , `` and get out of this deadly flower-bed as soon as you can . 
We will bring the little girl with us , but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried . '' 
So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go . 
In a moment he was out of sight . 
`` Let us make a chair with our hands , and carry her , '' said the Scarecrow . 
So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy 's lap , and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers . 
On and on they walked , and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end . 
They followed the bend of the river , and at last came upon their friend the Lion , lying fast asleep among the poppies . 
The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up , at last , and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy-bed , where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them . 
`` We can do nothing for him , '' said the Tin Woodman , sadly ; `` for he is much too heavy to lift . 
We must leave him here to sleep on forever , and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last . '' 
`` I 'm sorry , '' said the Scarecrow ; `` the Lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly . 
But let us go on . '' 
They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river , far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers , and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her . 
[ Illustration ] . 
The Queen of the Field Mice . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] `` We can not be far from the road of yellow brick , now , '' remarked the Scarecrow , as he stood beside the girl , `` for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away . '' 
The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl , and turning his head ( which worked beautifully on hinges ) he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass towards them . 
It was , indeed , a great , yellow wildcat , and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something , for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open , showing two rows of ugly teeth , while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire . 
As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field-mouse , and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try to kill such a pretty , harmless creature . 
So the Woodman raised his axe , and as the wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast 's head clean off from its body , and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces . 
The field-mouse , now that it was freed from its enemy , stopped short ; and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said , in a squeaky little voice , `` Oh , thank you ! 
Thank you ever so much for saving my life . '' 
`` Do n't speak of it , I beg of you , '' replied the Woodman . 
`` I have no heart , you know , so I am careful to help all those who may need a friend , even if it happens to be only a mouse . '' 
`` Only a mouse ! '' 
cried the little animal , indignantly ; `` why , I am a Queen -- the Queen of all the field-mice ! '' 
`` Oh , indeed , '' said the Woodman , making a bow . 
`` Therefore you have done a great deed , as well as a brave one , in saving my life , '' added the Queen . 
At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them , and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed , [ Illustration : `` _Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty , the Queen._ '' ] `` Oh , your Majesty , we thought you would be killed ! 
How did you manage to escape the great Wildcat ? '' 
and they all bowed so low to the little Queen that they almost stood upon their heads . 
`` This funny tin man , '' she answered , `` killed the Wildcat and saved my life . 
So hereafter you must all serve him , and obey his slightest wish . '' 
`` We will ! '' 
cried all the mice , in a shrill chorus . 
And then they scampered in all directions , for Toto had awakened from his sleep , and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group . 
Toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in Kansas , and he saw no harm in it . 
But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight , while he called to the mice : `` Come back ! 
come back ! 
Toto shall not hurt you . '' 
At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from a clump of grass and asked , in a timid voice , `` Are you sure he will not bite us ? '' 
`` I will not let him , '' said the Woodman ; `` so do not be afraid . '' 
[ Illustration ] One by one the mice came creeping back , and Toto did not bark again , although he tried to get out of the Woodman 's arms , and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin . 
Finally one of the biggest mice spoke . 
`` Is there anything we can do , '' it asked , `` to repay you for saving the life of our Queen ? '' 
`` Nothing that I know of , '' answered the Woodman ; but the Scarecrow , who had been trying to think , but could not because his head was stuffed with straw , said , quickly , `` Oh , yes ; you can save our friend , the Cowardly Lion , who is asleep in the poppy bed . '' 
`` A Lion ! '' 
cried the little Queen ; `` why , he would eat us all up . '' 
`` Oh , no ; '' declared the Scarecrow ; `` this Lion is a coward . '' 
`` Really ? '' 
asked the Mouse . 
`` He says so himself , '' answered the Scarecrow , `` and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend . 
If you will help us to save him I promise that he shall treat you all with kindness . '' 
`` Very well , '' said the Queen , `` we will trust you . 
But what shall we do ? '' 
`` Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to obey you ? '' 
`` Oh , yes ; there are thousands , '' she replied . 
`` Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible , and let each one bring a long piece of string . '' 
The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people . 
As soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible . 
`` Now , '' said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman , `` you must go to those trees by the river-side and make a truck that will carry the Lion . '' 
So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work ; and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees , from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches . 
He fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree-trunk . 
So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them . 
They came from all directions , and there were thousands of them : big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice ; and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth . 
It was about this time that Dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes . 
She was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass , with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly . 
But the Scarecrow told her about everything , and turning to the dignified little Mouse , he said , `` Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty , the Queen . '' 
Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a courtesy , after which she became quite friendly with the little girl . 
The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck , using the strings they had brought . 
One end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck . 
Of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it ; but when all the mice had been harnessed they were able to pull it quite easily . 
Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit on it , and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the Lion lay asleep . 
[ Illustration ] After a great deal of hard work , for the Lion was heavy , they managed to get him up on the truck . 
Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start , for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep . 
[ Illustration ] At first the little creatures , many though they were , could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck ; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed from behind , and they got along better . 
Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields , where he could breathe the sweet , fresh air again , instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers . 
Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death . 
She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was glad he had been rescued . 
Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes . 
The Queen of the Mice was the last to leave . 
`` If ever you need us again , '' she said , `` come out into the field and call , and we shall hear you and come to your assistance . 
Good bye ! '' 
`` Good bye ! '' 
they all answered , and away the Queen ran , while Dorothy held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her . 
After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken ; and the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by , which she ate for her dinner . 
[ Illustration ] . 
The Guardian of the Gate . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened , for he had lain among the poppies a long while , breathing in their deadly fragrance ; but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive . 
`` I ran as fast as I could , '' he said , sitting down and yawning ; `` but the flowers were too strong for me . 
How did you get me out ? '' 
Then they told him of the field-mice , and how they had generously saved him from death ; and the Cowardly Lion laughed , and said , `` I have always thought myself very big and terrible ; yet such small things as flowers came near to killing me , and such small animals as mice have saved my life . 
How strange it all is ! 
But , comrades , what shall we do now ? '' 
`` We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again , '' said Dorothy ; `` and then we can keep on to the Emerald City . '' 
So , the Lion being fully refreshed , and feeling quite himself again , they all started upon the journey , greatly enjoying the walk through the soft , fresh grass ; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the great Oz dwelt . 
[ Illustration ] The road was smooth and well paved , now , and the country about was beautiful ; so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind , and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades . 
Once more they could see fences built beside the road ; but these were painted green , and when they came to a small house , in which a farmer evidently lived , that also was painted green . 
They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon , and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions ; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion , of which they were much afraid . 
The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins . 
[ Illustration ] `` This must be the Land of Oz , '' said Dorothy , `` and we are surely getting near the Emerald City . '' 
`` Yes , '' answered the Scarecrow ; `` everything is green here , while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color . 
But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins and I 'm afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night . '' 
`` I should like something to eat besides fruit , '' said the girl , `` and I 'm sure Toto is nearly starved . 
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people . '' 
So , when they came to a good sized farm house , Dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked . 
A woman opened it just far enough to look out , and said , `` What do you want , child , and why is that great Lion with you ? '' 
`` We wish to pass the night with you , if you will allow us , '' answered Dorothy ; `` and the Lion is my friend and comrade , and would not hurt you for the world . '' 
`` Is he tame ? '' 
asked the woman , opening the door a little wider . 
`` Oh , yes ; '' said the girl , `` and he is a great coward , too ; so that he will be more afraid of you than you are of him . '' 
`` Well , '' said the woman , after thinking it over and taking another peep at the Lion , `` if that is the case you may come in , and I will give you some supper and a place to sleep . '' 
So they all entered the house , where there were , besides the woman , two children and a man . 
The man had hurt his leg , and was lying on the couch in a corner . 
They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company , and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked , `` Where are you all going ? '' 
`` To the Emerald City , '' said Dorothy , `` to see the Great Oz . '' 
`` Oh , indeed ! '' 
exclaimed the man . 
`` Are you sure that Oz will see you ? '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
she replied . 
`` Why , it is said that he never lets any one come into his presence . 
I have been to the Emerald City many times , and it is a beautiful and wonderful place ; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz , nor do I know of any living person who has seen him . '' 
`` Does he never go out ? '' 
asked the Scarecrow . 
`` Never . 
He sits day after day in the great throne room of his palace , and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face . '' 
`` What is he like ? '' 
asked the girl . 
`` That is hard to tell , '' said the man , thoughtfully . 
`` You see , Oz is a great Wizard , and can take on any form he wishes . 
So that some say he looks like a bird ; and some say he looks like an elephant ; and some say he looks like a cat . 
To others he appears as a beautiful fairy , or a brownie , or in any other form that pleases him . 
But who the real Oz is , when he is in his own form , no living person can tell . '' 
`` That is very strange , '' said Dorothy ; `` but we must try , in some way , to see him , or we shall have made our journey for nothing . '' 
[ Illustration ] `` Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz ? '' 
asked the man . 
`` I want him to give me some brains , '' said the Scarecrow , eagerly . 
`` Oh , Oz could do that easily enough , '' declared the man . 
`` He has more brains than he needs . '' 
`` And I want him to give me a heart , '' said the Tin Woodman . 
`` That will not trouble him , '' continued the man , `` for Oz has a large collection of hearts , of all sizes and shapes . '' 
`` And I want him to give me courage , '' said the Cowardly Lion . 
`` Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his throne room , '' said the man , `` which he has covered with a golden plate , to keep it from running over . 
He will be glad to give you some . '' 
`` And I want him to send me back to Kansas , '' said Dorothy . 
`` Where is Kansas ? '' 
asked the man , in surprise . 
`` I do n't know , '' replied Dorothy , sorrowfully ; `` but it is my home , and I 'm sure it 's somewhere . '' 
`` Very likely . 
Well , Oz can do anything ; so I suppose he will find Kansas for you . 
But first you must get to see him , and that will be a hard task ; for the great Wizard does not like to see anyone , and he usually has his own way . 
But what do you want ? '' 
he continued , speaking to Toto . 
Toto only wagged his tail ; for , strange to say , he could not speak . 
[ Illustration : `` _The Lion ate some of the porridge._ '' ] The woman now called to them that supper was ready , so they gathered around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread , and enjoyed her meal . 
The Lion ate some of the porridge , but did not care for it , saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses , not for lions . 
The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all . 
Toto ate a little of everything , and was glad to get a good supper again . 
The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in , and Toto lay down beside her , while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed . 
The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night , although of course they could not sleep . 
The next morning , as soon as the sun was up , they started on their way , and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them . 
`` That must be the Emerald City , '' said Dorothy . 
As they walked on , the green glow became brighter and brighter , and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels . 
Yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the City . 
It was high , and thick , and of a bright green color . 
In front of them , and at the end of the road of yellow brick , was a big gate , all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy . 
There was a bell beside the gate , and Dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within . 
Then the big gate swung slowly open , and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room , the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds . 
Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins . 
He was clothed all in green , from his head to his feet , and even his skin was of a greenish tint . 
At his side was a large green box . 
When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked , `` What do you wish in the Emerald City ? '' 
`` We came here to see the Great Oz , '' said Dorothy . 
The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over . 
`` It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz , '' he said , shaking his head in perplexity . 
`` He is powerful and terrible , and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great Wizard , he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant . '' 
[ Illustration ] `` But it is not a foolish errand , nor an idle one , '' replied the Scarecrow ; `` it is important . 
And we have been told that Oz is a good Wizard . '' 
`` So he is , '' said the green man ; `` and he rules the Emerald City wisely and well . 
But to those who are not honest , or who approach him from curiosity , he is most terrible , and few have ever dared ask to see his face . 
I am the Guardian of the Gates , and since you demand to see the Great Oz I must take you to his palace . 
But first you must put on the spectacles . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the Emerald City would blind you . 
Even those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and day . 
They are all locked on , for Oz so ordered it when the City was first built , and I have the only key that will unlock them . '' 
[ Illustration ] He opened the big box , and Dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape . 
All of them had green glasses in them . 
The Guardian of the gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her eyes . 
There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head , where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck . 
When they were on , Dorothy could not take them off had she wished , but of course she did not want to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City , so she said nothing . 
Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion , and even on little Toto ; and all were locked fast with the key . 
Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the palace . 
Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall he opened another gate , and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City .

[ Illustration ] Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles Dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City . 
The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds . 
They walked over a pavement of the same green marble , and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds , set closely , and glittering in the brightness of the sun . 
The window panes were of green glass ; even the sky above the City had a green tint , and the rays of the sun were green . 
There were many people , men , women and children , walking about , and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins . 
They looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes , and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Lion ; but no one spoke to them . 
Many shops stood in the street , and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green . 
Green candy and green pop-corn were offered for sale , as well as green shoes , green hats and green clothes of all sorts . 
At one place a man was selling green lemonade , and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies . 
There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind ; the men carried things around in little green carts , which they pushed before them . 
Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous . 
The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building , exactly in the middle of the City , which was the Palace of Oz , the Great Wizard . 
There was a soldier before the door , dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard . 
`` Here are strangers , '' said the Guardian of the Gates to him , `` and they demand to see the Great Oz . '' 
`` Step inside , '' answered the soldier , `` and I will carry your message to him . '' 
So they passed through the Palace gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds . 
The soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room , and when they were seated he said , politely , `` Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the Throne Room and tell Oz you are here . '' 
They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned . 
When , at last , he came back , Dorothy asked , `` Have you seen Oz ? '' 
[ Illustration ] `` Oh , no ; '' returned the soldier ; `` I have never seen him . 
But I spoke to him as he sat behind his screen , and gave him your message . 
He says he will grant you an audience , if you so desire ; but each one of you must enter his presence alone , and he will admit but one each day . 
Therefore , as you must remain in the Palace for several days , I will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey . '' 
`` Thank you , '' replied the girl ; `` that is very kind of Oz . '' 
The soldier now blew upon a green whistle , and at once a young girl , dressed in a pretty green silk gown , entered the room . 
She had lovely green hair and green eyes , and she bowed low before Dorothy as she said , `` Follow me and I will show you your room . '' 
So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto , and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace . 
It was the sweetest little room in the world , with a soft , comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane . 
There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room , that shot a spray of green perfume into the air , to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin . 
Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows , and there was a shelf with a row of little green books . 
When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh , they were so funny . 
In a wardrobe were many green dresses , made of silk and satin and velvet ; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly . 
`` Make yourself perfectly at home , '' said the green girl , `` and if you wish for anything ring the bell . 
Oz will send for you to-morrow morning . '' 
She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others . 
These she also led to rooms , and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace . 
Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow ; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot , just within the doorway , to wait till morning . 
It would not rest him to lie down , and he could not close his eyes ; so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room , just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world . 
The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit , for he remembered when he was made of flesh ; but not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order . 
The Lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest , and did not like being shut up in a room ; but he had too much sense to let this worry him , so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute . 
The next morning , after breakfast , the green maiden came to fetch Dorothy , and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns -- made of green brocaded satin . 
Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Toto 's neck , and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Oz . 
[ Illustration ] First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court , all dressed in rich costumes . 
These people had nothing to do but talk to each other , but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning , although they were never permitted to see Oz . 
As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously , and one of them whispered , `` Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible ? '' 
`` Of course , '' answered the girl , `` if he will see me . '' 
`` Oh , he will see you , '' said the soldier who had taken her message to the Wizard , `` although he does not like to have people ask to see him . 
Indeed , at first he was angry , and said I should send you back where you came from . 
Then he asked me what you looked like , and when I mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested . 
At last I told him about the mark upon your forehead , and he decided he would admit you to his presence . '' 
Just then a bell rang , and the green girl said to Dorothy , `` That is the signal . 
You must go into the Throne Room alone . '' 
She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place . 
It was a big , round room with a high arched roof , and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together . 
In the center of the roof was a great light , as bright as the sun , which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner . 
But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room . 
It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems , as did everything else . 
In the center of the chair was an enormous Head , without body to support it or any arms or legs whatever . 
There was no hair upon this head , but it had eyes and nose and mouth , and was bigger than the head of the biggest giant . 
As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily . 
Then the mouth moved , and Dorothy heard a voice say : `` I am Oz , the Great and Terrible . 
Who are you , and why do you seek me ? '' 
It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big Head ; so she took courage and answered , `` I am Dorothy , the Small and Meek . 
I have come to you for help . '' 
The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute . 
Then said the voice : `` Where did you get the silver shoes ? '' 
`` I got them from the wicked Witch of the East , when my house fell on her and killed her , '' she replied . 
`` Where did you get the mark upon your forehead ? '' 
continued the voice . 
`` That is where the good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me good-bye and sent me to you , '' said the girl . 
Again the eyes looked at her sharply , and they saw she was telling the truth . 
Then Oz asked , `` What do you wish me to do ? '' 
`` Send me back to Kansas , where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are , '' she answered , earnestly . 
`` I do n't like your country , although it is so beautiful . 
And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long . '' 
The eyes winked three times , and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room . 
And at last they looked at Dorothy again . 
`` Why should I do this for you ? '' 
asked Oz . 
`` Because you are strong and I am weak ; because you are a Great Wizard and I am only a helpless little girl , '' she answered . 
`` But you were strong enough to kill the wicked Witch of the East , '' said Oz . 
`` That just happened , '' returned Dorothy , simply ; `` I could not help it . '' 
`` Well , '' said the Head , `` I will give you my answer . 
You have no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in return . 
In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets . 
If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first . 
Help me and I will help you . '' 
`` What must I do ? '' 
asked the girl . 
`` Kill the wicked Witch of the West , '' answered Oz . 
`` But I can not ! '' 
exclaimed Dorothy , greatly surprised . 
`` You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes , which bear a powerful charm . 
There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all this land , and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to Kansas -- but not before . '' 
The little girl began to weep , she was so much disappointed ; and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously , as if the Great Oz felt that she could help him if she would . 
`` I never killed anything , willingly , '' she sobbed ; `` and even if I wanted to , how could I kill the Wicked Witch ? 
If you , who are Great and Terrible , can not kill her yourself , how do you expect me to do it ? '' 
[ Illustration ] `` I do not know , '' said the Head ; `` but that is my answer , and until the Wicked Witch dies you will not see your Uncle and Aunt again . 
Remember that the Witch is Wicked -- tremendously Wicked -- and ought to be killed . 
Now go , and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task . '' 
Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had said to her . 
`` There is no hope for me , '' she said , sadly , `` for Oz will not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West ; and that I can never do . '' 
Her friends were sorry , but could do nothing to help her ; so she went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep . 
The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Scarecrow and said , `` Come with me , for Oz has sent for you . '' 
So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne Room , where he saw , sitting in the emerald throne , a most lovely lady . 
She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels . 
Growing from her shoulders were wings , gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them . 
When the Scarecrow had bowed , as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him , before this beautiful creature , she looked upon him sweetly , and said , `` I am Oz , the Great and Terrible . 
Who are you , and why do you seek me ? '' 
Now the Scarecrow , who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had told him of , was much astonished ; but he answered her bravely . 
`` I am only a Scarecrow , stuffed with straw . 
Therefore I have no brains , and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw , so that I may become as much a man as any other in your dominions . '' 
`` Why should I do this for you ? '' 
asked the lady . 
`` Because you are wise and powerful , and no one else can help me , '' answered the Scarecrow . 
`` I never grant favors without some return , '' said Oz ; `` but this much I will promise . 
If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West I will bestow upon you a great many brains , and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz . '' 
`` I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch , '' said , the Scarecrow , in surprise . 
[ Illustration ] `` So I did . 
I do n't care who kills her . 
But until she is dead I will not grant your wish . 
Now go , and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire . '' 
The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what Oz had said ; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the great Wizard was not a Head , as she had seen him , but a lovely lady . 
`` All the same , '' said the Scarecrow , `` she needs a heart as much as the Tin Woodman . '' 
On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin Woodman and said , `` Oz has sent for you . 
Follow me , '' So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room . 
He did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely lady or a Head , but he hoped it would be the lovely lady . 
`` For , '' he said to himself , `` if it is the Head , I am sure I shall not be given a heart , since a head has no heart of its own and therefore can not feel for me . 
But if it is the lovely lady I shall beg hard for a heart , for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted . '' 
But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the Head nor the Lady , for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast . 
It was nearly as big as an elephant , and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight . 
The Beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros , only there were five eyes in its face . 
There were five long arms growing out of its body and it also had five long , slim legs . 
Thick , woolly hair covered every part of it , and a more dreadful looking monster could not be imagined . 
It was fortunate the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment , for it would have beat loud and fast from terror . 
But being only tin , the Woodman was not at all afraid , although he was much disappointed . 
`` I am Oz , the Great and Terrible , '' spake the Beast , in a voice that was one great roar . 
`` Who are you , and why do you seek me ? '' 
[ Illustration : `` _The Eyes looked at her thoughtfully._ '' ] `` I am a Woodman , and made of tin . 
Therefore I have no heart , and can not love . 
I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are . '' 
`` Why should I do this ? '' 
demanded the Beast . 
`` Because I ask it , and you alone can grant my request , '' answered the Woodman . 
Oz gave a low growl at this , but said , gruffly , `` If you indeed desire a heart , you must earn it . '' 
`` How ? '' 
asked the Woodman . 
`` Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West , '' replied the Beast . 
`` When the Witch is dead , come to me , and I will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz . '' 
So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen . 
They all wondered greatly at the many forms the great Wizard could take upon himself , and the Lion said , [ Illustration ] `` If he is a beast when I go to see him , I shall roar my loudest , and so frighten him that he will grant all I ask . 
And if he is the lovely lady , I shall pretend to spring upon her , and so compel her to do my bidding . 
And if he is the great Head , he will be at my mercy ; for I will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire . 
So be of good cheer my friends for all will yet be well . '' 
The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to the great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz . 
The Lion at once passed through the door , and glancing around saw , to his surprise , that before the throne was a Ball of Fire , so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it . 
His first thought was that Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up ; but , when he tried to go nearer , the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers , and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door . 
Then a low , quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire , and these were the words it spoke : [ Illustration ] `` I am Oz , the Great and Terrible . 
Who are you , and why do you seek me ? '' 
And the Lion answered , `` I am a Cowardly Lion , afraid of everything . 
I come to you to beg that you give me courage , so that in reality I may become the King of Beasts , as men call me . '' 
`` Why should I give you courage ? '' 
demanded Oz . 
`` Because of all Wizards you are the greatest , and alone have power to grant my request , '' answered the Lion . 
The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time , and the voice said , `` Bring me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead , and that moment I will give you courage . 
But so long as the Witch lives you must remain a coward . '' 
The Lion was angry at this speech , but could say nothing in reply , and while he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room . 
He was glad to find his friends waiting for him , and told them of his terrible interview with the Wizard . 
`` What shall we do now ? '' 
asked Dorothy , sadly . 
`` There is only one thing we can do , '' returned the Lion , `` and that is to go to the land of the Winkies , seek out the Wicked Witch , and destroy her . '' 
`` But suppose we can not ? '' 
said the girl . 
`` Then I shall never have courage , '' declared the Lion . 
`` And I shall never have brains , '' added the Scarecrow . 
`` And I shall never have a heart , '' spoke the Tin Woodman . 
`` And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry , '' said Dorothy , beginning to cry . 
`` Be careful ! '' 
cried the green girl , `` the tears will fall on your green silk gown , and spot it . '' 
So Dorothy dried her eyes and said , `` I suppose we must try it ; but I am sure I do not want to kill anybody , even to see Aunt Em again . '' 
`` I will go with you ; but I 'm too much of a coward to kill the Witch , '' said the Lion . 
`` I will go too , '' declared the Scarecrow ; `` but I shall not be of much help to you , I am such a fool . '' 
`` I have n't the heart to harm even a Witch , '' remarked the Tin Woodman ; `` but if you go I certainly shall go with you . '' 
Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning , and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled . 
The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better . 
The green girl , who was very kind to them , filled Dorothy's basket with good things to eat , and fastened a little bell around Toto 's neck with a green ribbon . 
They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight , when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the palace , and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg . 
[ Illustration : `` _The Soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets._ '' ] . 
The Search for the Wicked Witch . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived . 
This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box , and then he politely opened the gate for our friends . 
`` Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` There is no road , '' answered the Guardian of the Gates ; `` no one ever wishes to go that way . '' 
`` How , then , are we to find her ? '' 
enquired the girl . 
[ Illustration ] `` That will be easy , '' replied the man ; `` for when she knows you are in the Country of the Winkies she will find you , and make you all her slaves . '' 
`` Perhaps not , '' said the Scarecrow , `` for we mean to destroy her . '' 
[ Illustration ] `` Oh , that is different , '' said the Guardian of the Gates . 
`` No one has ever destroyed her before , so I naturally thought she would make slaves of you , as she has of all the rest . 
But take care ; for she is wicked and fierce , and may not allow you to destroy her . 
Keep to the West , where the sun sets , and you can not fail to find her . '' 
They thanked him and bade him good-bye , and turned toward the West , walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups . 
Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace , but now , to her surprise , she found it was no longer green , but pure white . 
The ribbon around Toto 's neck had also lost its green color and was as white as Dorothy 's dress . 
The Emerald City was soon left far behind . 
As they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier , for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the West , and the ground was untilled . 
In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces , for there were no trees to offer them shade ; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were tired , and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep , with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch . 
Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye , yet that was as powerful as a telescope , and could see everywhere . 
So , as she sat in the door of her castle , she happened to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep , with her friends all about her . 
They were a long distance off , but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country ; so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck . 
At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves . 
They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth . 
`` Go to those people , '' said the Witch , `` and tear them to pieces . '' 
`` Are you not going to make them your slaves ? '' 
asked the leader of the wolves . 
`` No , '' she answered , `` one is of tin , and one of straw ; one is a girl and another a Lion . 
None of them is fit to work , so you may tear them into small pieces . '' 
`` Very well , '' said the wolf , and he dashed away at full speed , followed by the others . 
It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming . 
`` This is my fight , '' said the Woodman ; `` so get behind me and I will meet them as they come . '' 
He seized his axe , which he had made very sharp , and as the leader of the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf 's head from its body , so that it immediately died . 
As soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up , and he also fell under the sharp edge of the Tin Woodman 's weapon . 
There were forty wolves , and forty times a wolf was killed ; so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman . 
Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow , who said , `` It was a good fight , friend . '' 
They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning . 
The little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves , but the Tin Woodman told her all . 
She thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast , after which they started again upon their journey . 
[ Illustration ] Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see afar off . 
She saw all her wolves lying dead , and the strangers still travelling through her country . 
This made her angrier than before , and she blew her silver whistle twice . 
Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her , enough to darken the sky . 
And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow , `` Fly at once to the strangers ; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces . '' 
The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her companions . 
When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid . 
But the Scarecrow said , `` This is my battle ; so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed . '' 
So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow , and he stood up and stretched out his arms . 
And when the crows saw him they were frightened , as these birds always are by scarecrows , and did not dare to come any nearer . 
But the King Crow said , `` It is only a stuffed man . 
I will peck his eyes out . '' 
The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow , who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died . 
And then another crow flew at him , and the Scarecrow twisted its neck also . 
There were forty crows , and forty times the Scarecrow twisted a neck , until at last all were lying dead beside him . 
Then he called to his companions to rise , and again they went upon their journey . 
When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap , she got into a terrible rage , and blew three times upon her silver whistle . 
[ Illustration ] Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air , and a swarm of black bees came flying towards her . 
`` Go to the strangers and sting them to death ! '' 
commanded the Witch , and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and her friends were walking . 
But the Woodman had seen them coming and the Scarecrow had decided what to do . 
`` Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the lion , '' he said to the Woodman , `` and the bees can not sting them . '' 
This the Woodman did , and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held Toto in her arms , the straw covered them entirely . 
The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting , so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin , without hurting the Woodman at all . 
And as bees can not live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees , and they lay scattered thick about the Woodman , like little heaps of fine coal . 
Then Dorothy and the Lion got up , and the girl helped the Tin Woodman put the straw back into the Scarecrow again , until he was as good as ever . 
So they started upon their journey once more . 
The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth . 
And then she called a dozen of her slaves , who were the Winkies , and gave them sharp spears , telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them . 
The Winkies were not a brave people , but they had to do as they were told ; so they marched away until they came near to Dorothy . 
Then the Lion gave a great roar and sprang toward them , and the poor Winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could . 
When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a strap , and sent them back to their work , after which she sat down to think what she should do next . 
She could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed ; but she was a powerful Witch , as well as a wicked one , and she soon made up her mind how to act . 
[ Illustration ] There was , in her cupboard , a Golden Cap , with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it . 
This Golden Cap had a charm . 
Whoever owned it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys , who would obey any order they were given . 
But no person could command these strange creatures more than three times . 
Twice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of the Cap . 
Once was when she had made the Winkies her slaves , and set herself to rule over their country . 
The Winged Monkeys had helped her do this . 
The second time was when she had fought against the Great Oz himself , and driven him out of the land of the West . 
The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this . 
Only once more could she use this Golden Cap , for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted . 
But now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone , and her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion , she saw there was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends . 
[ Illustration ] So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head . 
Then she stood upon her left foot and said , slowly , `` Ep-pe , pep-pe , kak-ke ! '' 
Next she stood upon her right foot and said , `` Hil-lo , hol-lo , hel-lo ! '' 
After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice , `` Ziz-zy , zuz-zy , zik ! '' 
Now the charm began to work . 
The sky was darkened , and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air . 
There was a rushing of many wings ; a great chattering and laughing ; and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys , each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders . 
One , much bigger than the others , seemed to be their leader . 
He flew close to the Witch and said , `` You have called us for the third and last time . 
What do you command ? '' 
`` Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the Lion , '' said the Wicked Witch . 
`` Bring that beast to me , for I have a mind to harness him like a horse , and make him work . '' 
`` Your commands shall be obeyed , '' said the leader ; and then , with a great deal of chattering and noise , the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place where Dorothy and her friends were walking . 
[ Illustration ] Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks . 
Here they dropped the poor Woodman , who fell a great distance to the rocks , where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan . 
Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow , and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head . 
They made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree . 
The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs , until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way . 
Then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the Witch 's castle , where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it , so that he could not escape . 
But Dorothy they did not harm at all . 
She stood , with Toto in her arms , watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn . 
The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her , his long , hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly ; but he saw the mark of the Good Witch 's kiss upon her forehead and stopped short , motioning the others not to touch her . 
[ Illustration : `` _The Monkeys wound many coils about his body._ '' ] `` We dare not harm this little girl , '' he said to them , `` for she is protected by the Power of Good , and that is greater than the Power of Evil . 
All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch and leave her there . '' 
So , carefully and gently , they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle , where they set her down upon the front door step . 
Then the leader said to the Witch , `` We have obeyed you as far as we were able . 
The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow are destroyed , and the Lion is tied up in your yard . 
The little girl we dare not harm , nor the dog she carries in her arms . 
Your power over our band is now ended , and you will never see us again . '' 
Then all the Winged Monkeys , with much laughing and chattering and noise , flew into the air and were soon out of sight . 
[ Illustration ] The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on Dorothy 's forehead , for she knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys nor she , herself , dare hurt the girl in any way . 
She looked down at Dorothy 's feet , and seeing the Silver Shoes , began to tremble with fear , for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them . 
At first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy ; but she happened to look into the child 's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was , and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the Silver Shoes gave her . 
So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself , and thought , `` I can still make her my slave , for she does not know how to use her power . '' 
Then she said to Dorothy , harshly and severely , `` Come with me ; and see that you mind everything I tell you , for if you do not I will make an end of you , as I did of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow . '' 
Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen , where the Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood . 
Dorothy went to work meekly , with her mind made up to work as hard as she could ; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill her . 
With Dorothy hard at work the Witch thought she would go into the court-yard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse ; it would amuse her , she was sure , to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive . 
But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid , and ran out and shut the gate again . 
`` If I can not harness you , '' said the Witch to the Lion , speaking through the bars of the gate , `` I can starve you . 
You shall have nothing to eat until you do as I wish . '' 
So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion ; but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked , `` Are you ready to be harnessed like a horse ? '' 
And the Lion would answer , `` No . 
If you come in this yard I will bite you . '' 
The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that every night , while the woman was asleep Dorothy carried him food from the cupboard . 
After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw , and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft , shaggy mane , while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape . 
But they could find no way to get out of the castle , for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies , who were the slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them . 
The girl had to work hard during the day , and often the Witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand . 
But , in truth , she did not dare to strike Dorothy , because of the mark upon her forehead . 
The child did not know this , and was full of fear for herself and Toto . 
Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg , in return . 
The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten , for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before . 
Dorothy 's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again . 
Sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours , with Toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face , whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress . 
Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him ; but he knew the little girl was unhappy , and that made him unhappy too . 
Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wore . 
Her Bees and her Crows and her Wolves were lying in heaps and drying up , and she had used up all the power of the Golden Cap ; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost . 
She watched Dorothy carefully , to see if she ever took off her shoes , thinking she might steal them . 
But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath . 
The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in Dorothy 's room at night to take the shoes , and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark , so she never came near when Dorothy was bathing . 
Indeed , the old Witch never touched water , nor ever let water touch her in any way . 
But the wicked creature was very cunning , and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted . 
She placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor , and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes . 
So that when Dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar , not being able to see it , and fell at full length . 
She was not much hurt , but in her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off , and before she could reach it the Witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot . 
The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick , for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm , and Dorothy could not use it against her , even had she known how to do so . 
[ Illustration ] The little girl , seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes , grew angry , and said to the Witch , `` Give me back my shoe ! '' 
`` I will not , '' retorted the Witch , `` for it is now my shoe , and not yours . '' 
`` You are a wicked creature ! '' 
cried Dorothy . 
`` You have no right to take my shoe from me . '' 
`` I shall keep it , just the same , '' said the Witch , laughing at her , `` and some day I shall get the other one from you , too . '' 
This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch , wetting her from head to foot . 
Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear ; and then , as Dorothy looked at her in wonder , the Witch began to shrink and fall away . 
`` See what you have done ! '' 
she screamed . 
`` In a minute I shall melt away . '' 
`` I 'm very sorry , indeed , '' said Dorothy , who was truly frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes . 
`` Did n't you know water would be the end of me ? '' 
asked the Witch , in a wailing , despairing voice . 
`` Of course not , '' answered Dorothy ; `` how should I ? '' 
`` Well , in a few minutes I shall be all melted , and you will have the castle to yourself . 
I have been wicked in my day , but I never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds . 
Look out -- here I go ! '' 
With these words the Witch fell down in a brown , melted , shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor . 
Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing , Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess . 
She then swept it all out the door . 
After picking out the silver shoe , which was all that was left of the old woman , she cleaned and dried it with a cloth , and put it on her foot again . 
Then , being at last free to do as she chose , she ran out to the court-yard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end , and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land . 
[ Illustration ] . 
The Rescue [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had been melted by a bucket of water , and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free . 
They went in together to the castle , where Dorothy 's first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves . 
There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies , for they had been made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch , who had always treated them with great cruelty . 
They kept this day as a holiday , then and ever after , and spent the time in feasting and dancing . 
`` If our friends , the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman , were only with us , '' said the Lion , `` I should be quite happy . '' 
`` Do n't you suppose we could rescue them ? '' 
asked the girl , anxiously . 
`` We can try , '' answered the Lion . 
So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends , and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for Dorothy , who had set them free from bondage . 
So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they knew the most , and they all started away . 
They travelled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin Woodman lay , all battered and bent . 
His axe was near him , but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short . 
The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms , and carried him back to the yellow castle again , Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend , and the Lion looking sober and sorry . 
When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies , `` Are any of your people tinsmiths ? '' 
`` Oh , yes ; some of us are very good tinsmiths , '' they told her . 
`` Then bring them to me , '' she said . 
And when the tinsmiths came , bringing with them all their tools in baskets , she enquired , [ Illustration : `` _The Tinsmiths worked for three days and four nights._ '' ] `` Can you straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman , and bend him back into shape again , and solder him together where he is broken ? '' 
The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever . 
So they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights , hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman , until at last he was straightened out into his old form , and his joints worked as well as ever . 
To be sure , there were several patches on him , but the tinsmiths did a good job , and as the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all . 
When , at last , he walked into Dorothy 's room and thanked her for rescuing him , he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy , and Dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron , so his joints would not be rusted . 
At the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again , and these tears did not need to be wiped away . 
As for the Lion , he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet , and he was obliged to go out into the court-yard and hold it in the sun till it dried . 
`` If we only had the Scarecrow with us again , '' said the Tin Woodman , when Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened , `` I should be quite happy . '' 
`` We must try to find him , '' said the girl . 
So she called the Winkies to help her , and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow 's clothes . 
It was a very tall tree , and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it ; but the Woodman said at once , `` I 'll chop it down , and then we can get the Scarecrow 's clothes . '' 
Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself , another of the Winkies , who was a goldsmith , had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman 's axe , instead of the old broken handle . 
Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver . 
As soon as he had spoken , the Tin Woodman began to chop , and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash , when the Scarecrow's clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground . 
Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the castle , where they were stuffed with nice , clean straw ; and , behold ! 
here was the Scarecrow , as good as ever , thanking them over and over again for saving him . 
Now they were reunited , Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the Yellow Castle , where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable . 
But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em , and said , `` We must go back to Oz , and claim his promise . '' 
`` Yes , '' said the Woodman , `` at last I shall get my heart . '' 
`` And I shall get my brains , '' added the Scarecrow , joyfully . 
`` And I shall get my courage , '' said the Lion , thoughtfully . 
`` And I shall get back to Kansas , '' cried Dorothy , clapping her hands . 
`` Oh , let us start for the Emerald City to-morrow ! '' 
[ Illustration ] This they decided to do . 
The next day they called the Winkies together and bade them good-bye . 
The Winkies were sorry to have them go , and they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West . 
Finding they were determined to go , the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden collar ; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet , studded with diamonds ; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick , to keep him from stumbling ; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a silver oil-can , inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels . 
Every one of the travellers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return , and all shook hands with them until their arms ached . 
Dorothy went to the Witch 's cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey , and there she saw the Golden Cap . 
She tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly . 
She did not know anything about the charm of the Golden Cap , but she saw that it was pretty , so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket . 
Then , being prepared for the journey , they all started for the Emerald City ; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them . 
. 
The Winged Monkeys [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] You will remember there was no road -- not even a pathway -- between the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City . 
When the four travellers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming , and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her . 
It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried . 
They knew , of course , they must go straight east , toward the rising sun ; and they started off in the right way . 
But at noon , when the sun was over their heads , they did not know which was east and which was west , and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields . 
They kept on walking , however , and at night the moon came out and shone brightly . 
So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning -- all but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman . 
The next morning the sun was behind a cloud , but they started on , as if they were quite sure which way they were going . 
`` If we walk far enough , '' said Dorothy , `` we shall sometime come to some place , I am sure . '' 
But day by day passed away , and they still saw nothing before them but the yellow fields . 
The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit . 
`` We have surely lost our way , '' he said , `` and unless we find it again in time to reach the Emerald City I shall never get my brains . '' 
`` Nor I my heart , '' declared the Tin Woodman . 
`` It seems to me I can scarcely wait till I get to Oz , and you must admit this is a very long journey . '' 
`` You see , '' said the Cowardly Lion , with a whimper , `` I have n't the courage to keep tramping forever , without getting anywhere at all . '' 
[ Illustration ] Then Dorothy lost heart . 
She sat down on the grass and looked at her companions , and they sat down and looked at her , and Toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head ; so he put out his tongue and panted and looked at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next . 
`` Suppose we call the Field Mice , '' she suggested . 
`` They could probably tell us the way to the Emerald City . '' 
`` To be sure they could , '' cried the Scarecrow ; `` why did n't we think of that before ? '' 
Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her . 
In a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet , and many of the small grey mice came running up to her . 
Among them was the Queen herself , who asked , in her squeaky little voice , `` What can I do for my friends ? '' 
`` We have lost our way , '' said Dorothy . 
`` Can you tell us where the Emerald City is ? '' 
[ Illustration ] `` Certainly , '' answered the Queen ; `` but it is a great way off , for you have had it at your backs all this time . '' 
Then she noticed Dorothy's Golden Cap , and said , `` Why do n't you use the charm of the Cap , and call the Winged Monkeys to you ? 
They will carry you to the City of Oz in less than an hour . '' 
`` I did n't know there was a charm , '' answered Dorothy , in surprise . 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` It is written inside the Golden Cap , '' replied the Queen of the Mice ; `` but if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away , for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us . '' 
`` Wo n't they hurt me ? '' 
asked the girl , anxiously . 
`` Oh , no ; they must obey the wearer of the Cap . 
Good-bye ! '' 
And she scampered out of sight , with all the mice hurrying after her . 
Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the lining . 
These , she thought , must be the charm , so she read the directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head . 
`` Ep-pe , pep-pe , kak-ke ! '' 
she said , standing on her left foot . 
`` What did you say ? '' 
asked the Scarecrow , who did not know what she was doing . 
`` Hil-lo , hol-lo , hel-lo ! '' 
Dorothy went on , standing this time on her right foot . 
`` Hello ! '' 
replied the Tin Woodman , calmly . 
[ Illustration : `` _The Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her._ '' ] `` Ziz-zy , zuz-zy , zik ! '' 
said Dorothy , who was now standing on both feet . 
This ended the saying of the charm , and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings , as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them . 
The King bowed low before Dorothy , and asked , `` What is your command ? '' 
`` We wish to go to the Emerald City , '' said the child , `` and we have lost our way . '' 
`` We will carry you , '' replied the King , and no sooner had he spoken than two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her . 
Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion , and one little Monkey seized Toto and flew after them , although the dog tried hard to bite him . 
The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first , for they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before ; but they saw that no harm was intended , so they rode through the air quite cheerfully , and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them . 
Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys , one of them the King himself . 
They had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her . 
`` Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap ? '' 
she asked . 
`` That is a long story , '' answered the King , with a laugh ; `` but as we have a long journey before us I will pass the time by telling you about it , if you wish . '' 
`` I shall be glad to hear it , '' she replied . 
`` Once , '' began the leader , `` we were a free people , living happily in the great forest , flying from tree to tree , eating nuts and fruit , and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master . 
Perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times , flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings , chasing birds , and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest . 
But we were careless and happy and full of fun , and enjoyed every minute of the day . 
This was many years ago , long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land . 
`` There lived here then , away at the North , a beautiful princess , who was also a powerful sorceress . 
All her magic was used to help the people , and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good . 
Her name was Gayelette , and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby . 
Everyone loved her , but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return , since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise . 
At last , however , she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years . 
Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband , so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish . 
When he grew to manhood , Quelala , as he was called , was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land , while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly , and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding . 
`` My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which lived in the forest near Gayalette 's palace , and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner . 
One day , just before the wedding , my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the river . 
He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet , and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do . 
At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala , carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river , and then dropped him into the water . 
`` 'Swim out , my fine fellow , ' '' cried my grandfather , `` 'and see if the water has spotted your clothes . ' '' 
Quelala was much too wise not to swim , and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune . 
He laughed , when he came to the top of the water , and swam in to shore . 
But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river . 
[ Illustration ] `` The princess was very angry , and she knew , of course , who did it . 
She had all the Winged Monkeys brought before her , and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated Quelala , and dropped in the river . 
But my grandfather pleaded hard , for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied , and Quelala said a kind word for them also ; so that Gayelette finally spared them , on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap . 
This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala , and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom . 
Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition , and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap , whomsoever he may be . '' 
`` And what became of them ? '' 
asked Dorothy , who had been greatly interested in the story . 
`` Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap , '' replied the Monkey , `` he was the first to lay his wishes upon us . 
As his bride could not bear the sight of us , he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us to always keep where she could never again set eyes on a Winged Monkey , which we were glad to do , for we were all afraid of her . 
`` This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West , who made us enslave the Winkies , and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West . 
Now the Golden Cap is yours , and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us . '' 
As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the green , shining walls of the Emerald City before them . 
She wondered at the rapid flight of the Monkeys , but was glad the journey was over . 
The strange creatures set the travellers down carefully before the gate of the City , the King bowed low to Dorothy , and then flew swiftly away , followed by all his band . 
`` That was a good ride , '' said the little girl . 
`` Yes , and a quick way out of our troubles . '' 
replied the Lion . 
`` How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap ! '' 
[ Illustration ] . 
The Discovery of OZ , The Terrible . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] The four travellers walked up to the great gate of the Emerald City and rang the bell . 
After ringing several times it was opened by the same Guardian of the Gate they had met before . 
`` What ! 
are you back again ? '' 
he asked , in surprise . 
`` Do you not see us ? '' 
answered the Scarecrow . 
`` But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West . '' 
`` We did visit her , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` And she let you go again ? '' 
asked the man , in wonder . 
`` She could not help it , for she is melted , '' explained the Scarecrow . 
`` Melted ! 
Well , that is good news , indeed , '' said the man . 
`` Who melted her ? '' 
`` It was Dorothy , '' said the Lion , gravely . 
`` Good gracious ! '' 
exclaimed the man , and he bowed very low indeed before her . 
Then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes , just as he had done before . 
Afterward they passed on through the gate into the Emerald City , and when the people heard from the Guardian of the Gate that they had melted the Wicked Witch of the West they all gathered around the travellers and followed them in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz . 
The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door , but he let them in at once and they were again met by the beautiful green girl , who showed each of them to their old rooms at once , so they might rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them . 
The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the other travellers had come back again , after destroying the Wicked Witch ; but Oz made no reply . 
They thought the Great Wizard would send for them at once , but he did not . 
They had no word from him the next day , nor the next , nor the next . 
The waiting was tiresome and wearing , and at last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion , after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery . 
So the Scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz , saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them , and find out whether he kept his promises or not . 
When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after nine o'clock the next morning . 
He had once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West , and he did not wish to meet them again . 
The four travellers passed a sleepless night , each thinking of the gift Oz had promised to bestow upon him . 
Dorothy fell asleep only once , and then she dreamed she was in Kansas , where Aunt Em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again . 
Promptly at nine o'clock the next morning the green whiskered soldier came to them , and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz . 
Of course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he had taken before , and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room . 
They kept close to the door and closer to one another , for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take . 
[ Illustration ] Presently they heard a Voice , seeming to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome , and it said , solemnly . 
`` I am Oz , the Great and Terrible . 
Why do you seek me ? '' 
They looked again in every part of the room , and then , seeing no one , Dorothy asked , `` Where are you ? '' 
`` I am everywhere , '' answered the Voice , `` but to the eyes of common mortals I am invisible . 
I will now seat myself upon my throne , that you may converse with me . '' 
Indeed , the Voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself ; so they walked toward it and stood in a row while Dorothy said : `` We have come to claim our promise , O Oz . '' 
`` What promise ? '' 
asked Oz . 
`` You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was destroyed , '' said the girl . 
`` And you promised to give me brains , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` And you promised to give me a heart , '' said the Tin Woodman . 
`` And you promised to give me courage , '' said the Cowardly Lion . 
`` Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed ? '' 
asked the Voice , and Dorothy thought it trembled a little . 
`` Yes , '' she answered , `` I melted her with a bucket of water . '' 
`` Dear me , '' said the Voice ; `` how sudden ! 
Well , come to me to-morrow , for I must have time to think it over . '' 
`` You 've had plenty of time already , '' said the Tin Woodman , angrily . 
`` We sha n't wait a day longer , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` You must keep your promises to us ! '' 
exclaimed Dorothy . 
The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard , so he gave a large , loud roar , which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner . 
As it fell with a crash they looked that way , and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder . 
For they saw , standing in just the spot the screen had hidden , a little , old man , with a bald head and a wrinkled face , who seemed to be as much surprised as they were . 
The Tin Woodman , raising his axe , rushed toward the little man and cried out , [ Illustration ] `` Who are you ? '' 
`` I am Oz , the Great and Terrible , '' said the little man , in a trembling voice , `` but do n't strike me -- please do n't ! -- and I 'll do anything you want me to . '' 
Our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay . 
`` I thought Oz was a great Head , '' said Dorothy . 
`` And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast , '' said the Tin Woodman . 
`` And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire , '' exclaimed the Lion . 
`` No ; you are all wrong , '' said the little man , meekly . 
`` I have been making believe . '' 
`` Making believe ! '' 
cried Dorothy . 
`` Are you not a great Wizard ? '' 
`` Hush , my dear , '' he said ; `` do n't speak so loud , or you will be overheard -- and I should be ruined . 
I 'm supposed to be a Great Wizard . '' 
`` And are n't you ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Not a bit of it , my dear ; I 'm just a common man . '' 
`` You 're more than that , '' said the Scarecrow , in a grieved tone ; `` you 're a humbug . '' 
`` Exactly so ! '' 
declared the little man , rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him ; `` I am a humbug . '' 
`` But this is terrible , '' said the Tin Woodman ; `` how shall I ever get my heart ? '' 
`` Or I my courage ? '' 
asked the Lion . 
`` Or I my brains ? '' 
wailed the Scarecrow , wiping the the tears from his eyes with his coat-sleeve . 
[ Illustration : `` _Exactly so ! 
I am a humbug._ '' ] `` My dear friends , '' said Oz , `` I pray you not to speak of these little things . 
Think of me , and the terrible trouble I 'm in at being found out . '' 
`` Does n't anyone else know you 're a humbug ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` No one knows it but you four -- and myself , '' replied Oz . 
`` I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out . 
It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room . 
Usually I will not see even my subjects , and so they believe I am something terrible . '' 
`` But , I do n't understand , '' said Dorothy , in bewilderment . 
`` How was it that you appeared to me as a great Head ? '' 
`` That was one of my tricks , '' answered Oz . 
`` Step this way , please , and I will tell you all about it . '' 
He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room , and they all followed him . 
He pointed to one corner , in which lay the Great Head , made out of many thicknesses of paper , and with a carefully painted face . 
`` This I hung from the ceiling by a wire , '' said Oz ; `` I stood behind the screen and pulled a thread , to make the eyes move and the mouth open . '' 
`` But how about the voice ? '' 
she enquired . 
`` Oh , I am a ventriloquist , '' said the little man , `` and I can throw the sound of my voice wherever I wish ; so that you thought it was coming out of the Head . 
Here are the other things I used to deceive you . '' 
He showed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely Lady ; and the Tin Woodman saw that his Terrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins , sewn together , with slats to keep their sides out . 
As for the Ball of Fire , the false Wizard had hung that also from the ceiling . 
It was really a ball of cotton , but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely . 
`` Really , '' said the Scarecrow , `` you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug . '' 
`` I am -- I certainly am , '' answered the little man , sorrowfully ; `` but it was the only thing I could do . 
Sit down , please , there are plenty of chairs ; and I will tell you my story . '' 
So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale : `` I was born in Omaha -- '' `` Why , that is n't very far from Kansas ! '' 
cried Dorothy . 
`` No ; but it 's farther from here , '' he said , shaking his head at her , sadly . 
`` When I grew up I became a ventriloquist , and at that I was very well trained by a great master . 
I can imitate any kind of a bird or beast . '' 
Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was . 
`` After a time , '' continued Oz , `` I tired of that , and became a balloonist . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day , so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus , '' he explained . 
[ Illustration ] `` Oh , '' she said ; `` I know . '' 
`` Well , one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted , so that I could n't come down again . 
It went way up above the clouds , so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many , many miles away . 
For a day and a night I travelled through the air , and on the morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country . 
`` It came down gradually , and I was not hurt a bit . 
But I found myself in the midst of a strange people , who , seeing me come from the clouds , thought I was a great Wizard . 
Of course I let them think so , because they were afraid of me , and promised to do anything I wished them to . 
`` Just to amuse myself , and keep the good people busy , I ordered them to build this City , and my palace ; and they did it all willingly and well . 
Then I thought , as the country was so green and beautiful , I would call it the Emerald City , and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people , so that everything they saw was green . '' 
`` But is n't everything here green ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` No more than in any other city , '' replied Oz ; `` but when you wear green spectacles , why of course everything you see looks green to you . 
The Emerald City was built a great many years ago , for I was a young man when the balloon brought me here , and I am a very old man now . 
But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an Emerald City , and it certainly is a beautiful place , abounding in jewels and precious metals , and every good thing that is needed to make one happy . 
I have been good to the people , and they like me ; but ever since this Palace was built I have shut myself up and would not see any of them . 
`` One of my greatest fears was the Witches , for while I had no magical powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do wonderful things . 
There were four of them in this country , and they ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West . 
Fortunately , the Witches of the North and South were good , and I knew they would do me no harm ; but the Witches of the East and West were terribly wicked , and had they not thought I was more powerful than they themselves , they would surely have destroyed me . 
As it was , I lived in deadly fear of them for many years ; so you can imagine how pleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East . 
When you came to me I was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other Witch ; but , now that you have melted her , I am ashamed to say that I can not keep my promises . '' 
`` I think you are a very bad man , '' said Dorothy . 
`` Oh , no , my dear ; I 'm really a very good man ; but I 'm a very bad Wizard , I must admit . '' 
`` Ca n't you give me brains ? '' 
asked the Scarecrow . 
`` You do n't need them . 
You are learning something every day . 
A baby has brains , but it does n't know much . 
Experience is the only thing that brings knowledge , and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get . '' 
`` That may all be true , '' said the Scarecrow , `` but I shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains . '' 
The false wizard looked at him carefully . 
`` Well , '' he said , with a sigh , `` I 'm not much of a magician , as I said ; but if you will come to me to-morrow morning , I will stuff your head with brains . 
I can not tell you how to use them , however ; you must find that out for yourself . '' 
[ Illustration ] `` Oh , thank you -- thank you ! '' 
cried the Scarecrow . 
`` I 'll find a way to use them , never fear ! '' 
`` But how about my courage ? '' 
asked the Lion , anxiously . 
`` You have plenty of courage , I am sure , '' answered Oz . 
`` All you need is confidence in yourself . 
There is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger . 
True courage is in facing danger when you are afraid , and that kind of courage you have in plenty . '' 
`` Perhaps I have , but I 'm scared just the same , '' said the Lion . 
`` I shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid . '' 
`` Very well ; I will give you that sort of courage to-morrow , '' replied Oz . 
`` How about my heart ? '' 
asked the Tin Woodman . 
`` Why , as for that , '' answered Oz , `` I think you are wrong to want a heart . 
It makes most people unhappy . 
If you only knew it , you are in luck not to have a heart . '' 
`` That must be a matter of opinion , '' said the Tin Woodman . 
`` For my part , I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur , if you will give me the heart . '' 
[ Illustration ] `` Very well , '' answered Oz , meekly . 
`` Come to me to-morrow and you shall have a heart . 
I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well continue the part a little longer . '' 
`` And now , '' said Dorothy , `` how am I to get back to Kansas ? '' 
`` We shall have to think about that , '' replied the little man , `` Give me two or three days to consider the matter and I 'll try to find a way to carry you over the desert . 
In the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests , and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish . 
There is only one thing I ask in return for my help -- such as it is . 
You must keep my secret and tell no one I am a humbug . '' 
They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned , and went back to their rooms in high spirits . 
Even Dorothy had hope that `` The Great and Terrible Humbug , '' as she called him , would find a way to send her back to Kansas , and if he did that she was willing to forgive him everything . 
[ Illustration ] . 
The Magic Art of the Great Humbug . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] Next morning the Scarecrow said to his friends : `` Congratulate me . 
I am going to Oz to get my brains at last . 
When I return I shall be as other men are . '' 
`` I have always liked you as you were , '' said Dorothy , simply . 
`` It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow , '' he replied . 
`` But surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out . '' 
Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the Throne Room , where he rapped upon the door . 
`` Come in , '' said Oz . 
The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window , engaged in deep thought . 
`` I have come for my brains , '' remarked the Scarecrow , a little uneasily . 
`` Oh , yes ; sit down in that chair , please , '' replied Oz . 
`` You must excuse me for taking your head off , but I shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place . '' 
`` That 's all right , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` You are quite welcome to take my head off , as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again . '' 
So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw . 
Then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran , which he mixed with a great many pins and needles . 
Having shaken them together thoroughly , he filled the top of the Scarecrow 's head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw , to hold it in place . 
When he had fastened the Scarecrow 's head on his body again he said to him , `` Hereafter you will be a great man , for I have given you a lot of bran-new brains . '' 
The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish , and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his friends . 
Dorothy looked at him curiously . 
His head was quite bulging out at the top with brains . 
`` How do you feel ? '' 
she asked . 
[ Illustration : `` _ ' I feel wise , indeed , ' said the Scarecrow._ '' ] `` I feel wise , indeed , '' he answered , earnestly . 
`` When I get used to my brains I shall know everything . '' 
`` Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head ? '' 
asked the Tin Woodman . 
`` That is proof that he is sharp , '' remarked the Lion . 
`` Well , I must go to Oz and get my heart , '' said the Woodman . 
So he walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door . 
`` Come in , '' called Oz , and the Woodman entered and said , `` I have come for my heart . '' 
`` Very well , '' answered the little man . 
`` But I shall have to cut a hole in your breast , so I can put your heart in the right place . 
I hope it wo n't hurt you . '' 
`` Oh , no ; '' answered the Woodman . 
`` I shall not feel it at all . '' 
[ Illustration ] So Oz brought a pair of tinners ' shears and cut a small , square hole in the left side of the Tin Woodman 's breast . 
Then , going to a chest of drawers , he took out a pretty heart , made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust . 
`` Is n't it a beauty ? '' 
he asked . 
`` It is , indeed ! '' 
replied the Woodman , who was greatly pleased . 
`` But is it a kind heart ? '' 
`` Oh , very ! '' 
answered Oz . 
He put the heart in the Woodman 's breast and then replaced the square of tin , soldering it neatly together where it had been cut . 
`` There , '' said he ; `` now you have a heart that any man might be proud of . 
I 'm sorry I had to put a patch on your breast , but it really could n't be helped . '' 
`` Never mind the patch , '' exclaimed the happy Woodman . 
`` I am very grateful to you , and shall never forget your kindness . '' 
[ Illustration ] `` Do n't speak of it , '' replied Oz . 
Then the Tin Woodman went back to his friends , who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune . 
The Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door . 
`` Come in , '' said Oz . 
`` I have come for my courage , '' announced the Lion , entering the room . 
`` Very well , '' answered the little man ; `` I will get it for you . '' 
He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle , the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish , beautifully carved . 
Placing this before the Cowardly Lion , who sniffed at it as if he did not like it , the Wizard said , `` Drink . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked the Lion . 
`` Well , '' answered Oz , `` if it were inside of you , it would be courage . 
You know , of course , that courage is always inside one ; so that this really can not be called courage until you have swallowed it . 
Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible . '' 
The Lion hesitated no longer , but drank till the dish was empty . 
`` How do you feel now ? '' 
asked Oz . 
`` Full of courage , '' replied the Lion , who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune . 
Oz , left to himself , smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted . 
`` How can I help being a humbug , '' he said , `` when all these people make me do things that everybody knows ca n't be done ? 
It was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy , because they imagined I could do anything . 
But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas , and I 'm sure I don't know how it can be done . '' 
. 
How the Balloon was Launched . 
[ Illustration ] For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz . 
These were sad days for the little girl , although her friends were all quite happy and contented . 
The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head ; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself . 
When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast ; and he told Dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh . 
The Lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth , and would gladly face an army of men or a dozen of the fierce Kalidahs . 
Thus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy , who longed more than ever to get back to Kansas . 
On the fourth day , to her great joy , Oz sent for her , and when she entered the Throne Room he said , pleasantly : `` Sit down , my dear ; I think I have found the way to get you out of this country . '' 
`` And back to Kansas ? '' 
she asked , eagerly . 
`` Well , I 'm not sure about Kansas , '' said Oz ; `` for I have n't the faintest notion which way it lies . 
But the first thing to do is to cross the desert , and then it should be easy to find your way home . '' 
`` How can I cross the desert ? '' 
she enquired . 
`` Well , I 'll tell you what I think , '' said the little man . 
`` You see , when I came to this country it was in a balloon . 
You also came through the air , being carried by a cyclone . 
So I believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air . 
Now , it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone ; but I 've been thinking the matter over , and I believe I can make a balloon . '' 
`` How ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` A balloon , '' said Oz , `` is made of silk , which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it . 
I have plenty of silk in the Palace , so it will be no trouble for us to make the balloon . 
But in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with , to make it float . '' 
`` If it wo n't float , '' remarked Dorothy , `` it will be of no use to us . '' 
`` True , '' answered Oz . 
`` But there is another way to make it float , which is to fill it with hot air . 
Hot air is n't as good as gas , for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert , and we should be lost . '' 
`` We ! '' 
exclaimed the girl ; `` are you going with me ? '' 
`` Yes , of course , '' replied Oz . 
`` I am tired of being such a humbug . 
If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a Wizard , and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them . 
So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day , and it gets tiresome . 
I 'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again . '' 
[ Illustration ] `` I shall be glad to have your company , '' said Dorothy . 
`` Thank you , '' he answered . 
`` Now , if you will help me sew the silk together , we will begin to work on our balloon . '' 
So Dorothy took a needle and thread , and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together . 
First there was a strip of light green silk , then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green ; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them . 
It took three days to sew all the strips together , but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long . 
Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue , to make it air-tight , after which he announced that the balloon was ready . 
`` But we must have a basket to ride in , '' he said . 
So he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket , which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon . 
When it was all ready , Oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds . 
The news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight . 
Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace , and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity . 
The Tin Woodman had chopped a big pile of wood , and now he made a fire of it , and Oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag . 
Gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air , until finally the basket just touched the ground . 
Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice : `` I am now going away to make a visit . 
While I am gone the Scarecrow will rule over you . 
I command you to obey him as you would me . '' 
The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground , for the air within it was hot , and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky . 
`` Come , Dorothy ! '' 
cried the Wizard ; `` hurry up , or the balloon will fly away . '' 
`` I ca n't find Toto anywhere , '' replied Dorothy , who did not wish to leave her little dog behind . 
Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten , and Dorothy at last found him . 
She picked him up and ran toward the balloon . 
[ Illustration ] She was within a few steps of it , and Oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket , when , crack ! 
went the ropes , and the balloon rose into the air without her . 
[ Illustration ] `` Come back ! '' 
she screamed ; `` I want to go , too ! '' 
`` I ca n't come back , my dear , '' called Oz from the basket . 
`` Good-bye ! '' 
`` Good-bye ! '' 
shouted everyone , and all eyes were turned upward to where the Wizard was riding in the basket , rising every moment farther and farther into the sky . 
And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz , the Wonderful Wizard , though he may have reached Omaha safely , and be there now , for all we know . 
But the people remembered him lovingly , and said to one another , `` Oz was always our friend . 
When he was here he built for us this beautiful Emerald City , and now he is gone he has left the Wise Scarecrow to rule over us . '' 
Still , for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful Wizard , and would not be comforted . 
. 
Away to the South . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] Dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas again ; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon . 
And she also felt sorry at losing Oz , and so did her companions . 
The Tin Woodman came to her and said , `` Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart . 
I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone , if you will kindly wipe away my tears , so that I shall not rust . '' 
[ Illustration ] `` With pleasure , '' she answered , and brought a towel at once . 
Then the Tin Woodman wept for several minutes , and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel . 
When he had finished he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jewelled oil-can , to guard against mishap . 
The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City , and although he was not a Wizard the people were proud of him . 
`` For , '' they said , `` there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man . '' 
And , so far as they knew , they were quite right . 
The morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz the four travellers met in the Throne Room and talked matters over . 
The Scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him . 
`` We are not so unlucky , '' said the new ruler ; `` for this Palace and the Emerald City belong to us , and we can do just as we please . 
When I remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer's cornfield , and that I am now the ruler of this beautiful City , I am quite satisfied with my lot . '' 
`` I also , '' said the Tin Woodman , `` am well pleased with my new heart ; and , really , that was the only thing I wished in all the world . '' 
`` For my part , I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that ever lived , if not braver , '' said the Lion , modestly , [ Illustration : `` _The Scarecrow sat on the big throne._ '' ] `` If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City , '' continued the Scarecrow , `` we might all be happy together . '' 
`` But I do n't want to live here , '' cried Dorothy . 
`` I want to go to Kansas , and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry . '' 
`` Well , then , what can be done ? '' 
enquired the Woodman . 
The Scarecrow decided to think , and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains . 
Finally he said : `` Why not call the Winged Monkeys , and asked them to carry you over the desert ? '' 
`` I never thought of that ! '' 
said Dorothy , joyfully . 
`` It 's just the thing . 
I 'll go at once for the Golden Cap . '' 
When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words , and soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through an open window and stood beside her . 
`` This is the second time you have called us , '' said the Monkey King , bowing before the little girl . 
`` What do you wish ? '' 
`` I want you to fly with me to Kansas , '' said Dorothy . 
But the Monkey King shook his head . 
`` That can not be done , '' he said . 
`` We belong to this country alone , and can not leave it . 
There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet , and I suppose there never will be , for they do n't belong there . 
We shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power , but we can not cross the desert . 
Good-bye . '' 
And with another bow the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away through the window , followed by all his band . 
Dorothy was almost ready to cry with disappointment . 
`` I have wasted the charm of the Golden Cap to no purpose , '' she said , `` for the Winged Monkeys can not help me . '' 
`` It is certainly too bad ! '' 
said the tender hearted Woodman . 
The Scarecrow was thinking again , and his head bulged out so horribly that Dorothy feared it would burst . 
`` Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers , '' he said , `` and ask his advice . '' 
[ Illustration ] So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly , for while Oz was alive he never was allowed to come further than the door . 
`` This little girl , '' said the Scarecrow to the soldier , `` wishes to cross the desert . 
How can she do so ? '' 
`` I can not tell , '' answered the soldier ; `` for nobody has ever crossed the desert , unless it is Oz himself . '' 
`` Is there no one who can help me ? '' 
asked Dorothy , earnestly . 
`` Glinda might , '' he suggested . 
`` Who is Glinda ? '' 
enquired the Scarecrow . 
`` The Witch of the South . 
She is the most powerful of all the Witches , and rules over the Quadlings . 
Besides , her castle stands on the edge of the desert , so she may know a way to cross it . '' 
`` Glinda is a good Witch , is n't she ? '' 
asked the child . 
`` The Quadlings think she is good , '' said the soldier , `` and she is kind to everyone . 
I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman , who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived . '' 
`` How can I get to her castle ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` The road is straight to the South , '' he answered , `` but it is said to be full of dangers to travellers . 
There are wild beasts in the woods , and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country . 
For this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City . '' 
The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said , `` It seems , in spite of dangers , that the best thing Dorothy can do is to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her . 
For , of course , if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas . '' 
`` You must have been thinking again , '' remarked the Tin Woodman . 
`` I have , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` I shall go with Dorothy , '' declared the Lion , `` for I am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again . 
I am really a wild beast , you know . 
Besides , Dorothy will need someone to protect her . '' 
`` That is true , '' agreed the Woodman . 
`` My axe may be of service to her ; so I , also , will go with her to the Land of the South . '' 
`` When shall we start ? '' 
asked the Scarecrow . 
`` Are you going ? '' 
they asked , in surprise . 
`` Certainly . 
If it was n't for Dorothy I should never have had brains . 
She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the Emerald City . 
So my good luck is all due to her , and I shall never leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all . '' 
`` Thank you , '' said Dorothy , gratefully . 
`` You are all very kind to me . 
But I should like to start as soon as possible . '' 
`` We shall go to-morrow morning , '' returned the Scarecrow . 
`` So now let us all get ready , for it will be a long journey . '' 
[ Illustration ] . 
Attacked by the Fighting Trees . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye , and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers , who had walked with them as far as the gate . 
When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble . 
But he at once unlocked their spectacles , which he put back into the green box , and gave them many good wishes to carry with them . 
`` You are now our ruler , '' he said to the Scarecrow ; `` so you must come back to us as soon as possible . '' 
`` I certainly shall if I am able , '' the Scarecrow replied ; `` but I must help Dorothy to get home , first . '' 
As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said , `` I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City , and everyone has been good to me . 
I can not tell you how grateful I am . '' 
`` Do n't try , my dear , '' he answered . 
`` We should like to keep you with us , but if it is your wish to return to Kansas I hope you will find a way . '' 
He then opened the gate of the outer wall and they walked forth and started upon their journey . 
The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the Land of the South . 
They were all in the best of spirits , and laughed and chatted together . 
Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home , and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of use to her . 
As for the Lion , he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again , while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies , barking merrily all the time . 
`` City life does not agree with me at all , '' remarked the Lion , as they walked along at a brisk pace . 
`` I have lost much flesh since I lived there , and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous I have grown . '' 
[ Illustration : `` _The branches bent down and twined around him._ '' ] They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City . 
All they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls , and high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz . 
`` Oz was not such a bad Wizard , after all , '' said the Tin Woodman , as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast . 
`` He knew how to give me brains , and very good brains , too , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me , '' added the Lion , `` he would have been a brave man . '' 
Dorothy said nothing . 
Oz had not kept the promise he made her , but he had done his best , so she forgave him . 
As he said , he was a good man , even if he was a bad Wizard . 
The first day 's journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the Emerald City on every side . 
They slept that night on the grass , with nothing but the stars over them ; and they rested very well indeed . 
In the morning they travelled on until they came to a thick wood . 
There was no way of going around it , for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see ; and , besides , they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost . 
So they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest . 
The Scarecrow , who was in the lead , finally discovered a big tree with such wide spreading-branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath . 
So he walked forward to the tree , but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him , and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travellers . 
This did not hurt the Scarecrow , but it surprised him , and he looked rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up . 
`` Here is another space between the trees , '' called the Lion . 
[ Illustration ] `` Let me try it first , '' said the Scarecrow , `` for it does n't hurt me to get thrown about . '' 
He walked up to another tree , as he spoke , but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again . 
`` This is strange , '' exclaimed Dorothy ; `` what shall we do ? '' 
`` The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us , and stop our journey , '' remarked the Lion . 
`` I believe I will try it myself , '' said the Woodman , and shouldering his axe he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so roughly . 
When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two . 
At once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain , and the Tin Woodman passed safely under it . 
`` Come on ! '' 
he shouted to the others ; `` be quick ! '' 
They all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury , except Toto , who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled . 
But the Woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free . 
The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back , so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches , and that probably these were the policemen of the forest , and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it . 
The four travellers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the further edge of the wood . 
Then , to their surprise , they found before them a high wall , which seemed to be made of white china . 
It was smooth , like the surface of a dish , and higher than their heads . 
`` What shall we do now ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
`` I will make a ladder , '' said the Tin Woodman , `` for we certainly must climb over the wall . '' 
. 
The Dainty China Country . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] While the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest Dorothy lay down and slept , for she was tired by the long walk . 
The Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him . 
The Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked , and said to him : `` I can not think why this wall is here , nor what it is made of . '' 
`` Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall , '' replied the Woodman ; `` when we have climbed over it we shall know what is on the other side . '' 
After a time the ladder was finished . 
It looked clumsy , but the Tin Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose . 
The Scarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto , and told them that the ladder was ready . 
The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first , but he was so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off . 
When he got his head over the top of the wall the Scarecrow said , `` Oh , my ! '' 
`` Go on , '' exclaimed Dorothy . 
So the Scarecrow climbed further up and sat down on the top of the wall , and Dorothy put her head over and cried , `` Oh , my ! '' 
just as the Scarecrow had done . 
Then Toto came up , and immediately began to bark , but Dorothy made him be still . 
The Lion climbed the ladder next , and the Tin Woodman came last ; but both of them cried , `` Oh , my ! '' 
as soon as they looked over the wall . 
When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall they looked down and saw a strange sight . 
[ Illustration : `` _These people were all made of china._ '' ] Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter . 
Scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colours . 
These houses were quite small , the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothy 's waist . 
There were also pretty little barns , with china fences around them , and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens , all made of china , were standing about in groups . 
But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country . 
There were milk-maids and shepherdesses , with bright-colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns ; and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple ; and shepherds dressed in knee-breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them , and golden buckles on their shoes ; and princes with jewelled crowns upon their heads , wearing ermine robes and satin doublets ; and funny clowns in ruffled gowns , with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall , pointed caps . 
And , strangest of all , these people were all made of china , even to their clothes , and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than Dorothy 's knee . 
No one did so much as look at the travellers at first , except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head , which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice , afterwards running away again . 
`` How shall we get down ? '' 
asked Dorothy . 
They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up , so the Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet . 
Of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet . 
When all were safely down they picked up the Scarecrow , whose body was quite flattened out , and patted his straw into shape again . 
`` We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side , '' said Dorothy ; `` for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due South . '' 
They began walking through the country of the china people , and the first thing they came to was a china milk-maid milking a china cow . 
As they drew near the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool , the pail , and even the milk-maid herself , all falling on the china ground with a great clatter . 
Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg short off , and that the pail was lying in several small pieces , while the poor milk-maid had a nick in her left elbow . 
`` There ! '' 
cried the milk-maid , angrily ; `` see what you have done ! 
My cow has broken her leg , and I must take her to the mender 's shop and have it glued on again . 
What do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow ? '' 
`` I 'm very sorry , '' returned Dorothy ; `` please forgive us . '' 
But the pretty milk-maid was much too vexed to make any answer . 
She picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away , the poor animal limping on three legs . 
As she left them the milk-maid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers , holding her nicked elbow close to her side . 
[ Illustration ] Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap . 
`` We must be very careful here , '' said the kind-hearted Woodman , `` or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it . '' 
A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautiful dressed young princess , who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away . 
Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess , so she ran after her ; but the china girl cried out , `` Do n't chase me ! 
do n't chase me ! '' 
She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said , `` Why not ? '' 
`` Because , '' answered the princess , also stopping , a safe distance away , `` if I run I may fall down and break myself . '' 
`` But could n't you be mended ? '' 
asked the girl . 
`` Oh , yes ; but one is never so pretty after being mended , you know , '' replied the princess . 
`` I suppose not , '' said Dorothy . 
`` Now there is Mr. Joker , one of our clowns , '' continued the china lady , `` who is always trying to stand upon his head . 
He has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places , and doesn't look at all pretty . 
Here he comes now , so you can see for yourself . '' 
Indeed , a jolly little Clown now came walking toward them , and Dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks , running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places . 
The Clown put his hands in his pockets , and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily he said , `` My lady fair , Why do you stare At poor old Mr. Joker ? 
You 're quite as stiff And prim as if You 'd eaten up a poker ! '' 
`` Be quiet , sir ! '' 
said the princess ; `` ca n't you see these are strangers , and should be treated with respect ? '' 
`` Well , that 's respect , I expect , '' declared the Clown , and immediately stood upon his head . 
`` Do n't mind Mr. Joker , '' said the princess to Dorothy ; `` he is considerably cracked in his head , and that makes him foolish . '' 
[ Illustration ] `` Oh , I do n't mind him a bit , '' said Dorothy . 
`` But you are so beautiful , '' she continued , `` that I am sure I could love you dearly . 
Wo n't you let me carry you back to Kansas and stand you on Aunt Em's mantle-shelf ? 
I could carry you in my basket . '' 
`` That would make me very unhappy , '' answered the china princess . 
`` You see , here in our own country we live contentedly , and can talk and move around as we please . 
But whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen , and we can only stand straight and look pretty . 
Of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantle-shelves and cabinets and drawing-room tables , but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country . '' 
`` I would not make you unhappy for all the world ! '' 
exclaimed Dorothy ; `` so I 'll just say good-bye . '' 
`` Good-bye , '' replied the princess . 
They walked carefully through the china country . 
The little animals and all the people scampered out of their way , fearing the strangers would break them , and after an hour or so the travellers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall . 
It was not as high as the first , however , and by standing upon the Lion 's back they all managed to scramble to the top . 
Then the Lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall ; but just as he jumped he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces . 
`` That was too bad , '' said Dorothy , `` but really I think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow 's leg and a church . 
They are all so brittle ! '' 
`` They are , indeed , '' said the Scarecrow , `` and I am thankful I am made of straw and can not be easily damaged . 
There are worse things in the world than being a Scarecrow . '' 
. 
The Lion Becomes the King of Beasts . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] After climbing down from the china wall the travellers found themselves in a disagreeable country , full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall , rank grass . 
It was difficult to walk far without falling into muddy holes , for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight . 
However , by carefully picking their way , they got safely along until they reached solid ground . 
But here the country seemed wilder than ever , and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest , where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen . 
`` This forest is perfectly delightful , '' declared the Lion , looking around him with joy ; `` never have I seen a more beautiful place . '' 
`` It seems gloomy , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` Not a bit of it , '' answered the Lion ; `` I should like to live here all my life . 
See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees . 
Surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home . '' 
`` Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now , '' said Dorothy . 
`` I suppose there are , '' returned the Lion ; `` but I do not see any of them about . '' 
They walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther . 
Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep , while the Woodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual . 
When morning came they started again . 
Before they had gone far they heard a low rumble , as of the growling of many wild animals . 
Toto whimpered a little but none of the others was frightened and they kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood , in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety . 
There were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history , and for a moment Dorothy was afraid . 
But the Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting , and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble . 
As he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him , and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic . 
The biggest of the tigers came up to the Lion and bowed , saying , [ Illustration ] `` Welcome , O King of Beasts ! 
You have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more . '' 
`` What is your trouble ? '' 
asked the Lion , quietly . 
`` We are all threatened , '' answered the tiger , `` by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest . 
It is a most tremendous monster , like a great spider , with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk . 
It has eight of these long legs , and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth , where he eats it as a spider does a fly . 
Not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive , and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us . '' 
The Lion thought for a moment . 
`` Are there any other lions in this forest ? '' 
he asked . 
`` No ; there were some , but the monster has eaten them all . 
And , besides , they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you . '' 
`` If I put an end to your enemy will you bow down to me and obey me as King of the Forest ? '' 
enquired the Lion . 
`` We will do that gladly , '' returned the tiger ; and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar : `` We will ! '' 
`` Where is this great spider of yours now ? '' 
asked the Lion . 
`` Yonder , among the oak trees , '' said the tiger , pointing with his fore-foot . 
`` Take good care of these friends of mine , '' said the Lion , `` and I will go at once to fight the monster . '' 
He bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy . 
The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him , and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust . 
Its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said , and it 's body covered with coarse black hair . 
It had a great mouth , with a row of sharp teeth a foot long ; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp 's waist . 
This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature , and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake , he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster 's back . 
Then , with one blow of his heavy paw , all armed with sharp claws , he knocked the spider 's head from its body . 
Jumping down , he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling , when he knew it was quite dead . 
The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said , proudly , `` You need fear your enemy no longer . '' 
Then the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King , and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her way to Kansas . 
. 
The Country of the Quadlings [ Illustration ] [ Illustration : `` _The Head shot forward and struck the Scarecrow._ '' ] [ Illustration ] The four travellers passed through the rest of the forest in safety , and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill , covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock . 
`` That will be a hard climb , '' said the Scarecrow , `` but we must get over the hill , nevertheless . '' 
So he led the way and the others followed . 
They had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out , `` Keep back ! '' 
`` Who are you ? '' 
asked the Scarecrow . 
Then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said , `` This hill belongs to us , and we do n't allow anyone to cross it . '' 
`` But we must cross it , '' said the Scarecrow . 
`` We 're going to the country of the Quadlings . '' 
`` But you shall not ! '' 
replied the voice , and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travellers had ever seen . 
He was quite short and stout and had a big head , which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles . 
But he had no arms at all , and , seeing this , the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill . 
So he said , `` I 'm sorry not to do as you wish , but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not , '' and he walked boldly forward . 
As quick as lightning the man 's head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head , where it was flat , struck the Scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling , over and over , down the hill . 
Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body , and the man laughed harshly as he said , `` It is n't as easy as you think ! '' 
A chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks , and Dorothy saw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside , one behind every rock . 
The Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow's mishap , and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder he dashed up the hill . 
Again a head shot swiftly out , and the great Lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball . 
Dorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet , and the Lion came up to her , feeling rather bruised and sore , and said , `` It is useless to fight people with shooting heads ; no one can withstand them . '' 
`` What can we do , then ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Call the Winged Monkeys , '' suggested the Tin Woodman ; `` you have still the right to command them once more . '' 
`` Very well , '' she answered , and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered the magic words . 
The Monkeys were as prompt as ever , and in a few moments the entire band stood before her . 
`` What are your commands ? '' 
enquired the King of the Monkeys , bowing low . 
`` Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings , '' answered the girl . 
`` It shall be done , '' said the King , and at once the Winged Monkeys caught the four travellers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with them . 
As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with vexation , and shot their heads high in the air ; but they could not reach the Winged Monkeys , which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the Quadlings . 
`` This is the last time you can summon us , '' said the leader to Dorothy ; `` so good-bye and good luck to you . '' 
`` Good-bye , and thank you very much , '' returned the girl ; and the Monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling . 
The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy . 
There was field upon field of ripening grain , with well-paved roads running between , and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them . 
The fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red , just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the country of the Munchkins . 
The Quadlings themselves , who were short and fat and looked chubby and good natured , were dressed all in red , which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain . 
The Monkeys had set them down near a farm house , and the four travellers walked up to it and knocked at the door . 
It was opened by the farmer 's wife , and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner , with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies , and a bowl of milk for Toto . 
`` How far is it to the Castle of Glinda ? '' 
asked the child . 
`` It is not a great way , '' answered the farmer 's wife . 
`` Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it . '' 
Thanking the good woman , they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful Castle . 
Before the gates were three young girls , dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid ; and as Dorothy approached one of them said to her , `` Why have you come to the South Country ? '' 
`` To see the Good Witch who rules here , '' she answered . 
`` Will you take me to her ? '' 
`` Let me have your name and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you . '' 
They told who they were , and the girl soldier went into the Castle . 
After a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once . 
[ Illustration ] . 
The Good Witch Grants Dorothy's Wish . 
[ Illustration ] [ Illustration : `` _You must give me the Golden Cap._ '' ] [ Illustration ] Before they went to see Glinda , however , they were taken to a room of the Castle , where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair , and the Lion shook the dust out of his mane , and the Scarecrow patted himself into his best shape , and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints . 
When they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies . 
She was both beautiful and young to their eyes . 
Her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders . 
Her dress was pure white ; but her eyes were blue , and they looked kindly upon the little girl . 
`` What can I do for you , my child ? '' 
she asked . 
Dorothy told the Witch all her story ; how the cyclone had brought her to the Land of Oz , how she had found her companions , and of the wonderful adventures they had met with . 
`` My greatest wish now , '' she added , `` is to get back to Kansas , for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me , and that will make her put on mourning ; and unless the crops are better this year than they were last I am sure Uncle Henry can not afford it . '' 
Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet , upturned face of the loving little girl . 
`` Bless your dear heart , '' she said , `` I am sure I can tell you of a way to get back to Kansas . '' 
Then she added : `` But , if I do , you must give me the Golden Cap . '' 
`` Willingly ! '' 
exclaimed Dorothy ; `` indeed , it is of no use to me now , and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times . '' 
`` And I think I shall need their service just those three times , '' answered Glinda , smiling . 
Dorothy then gave her the Golden Cap , and the Witch said to the Scarecrow , `` What will you do when Dorothy has left us ? '' 
`` I will return to the Emerald City , '' he replied , `` for Oz has made me its ruler and the people like me . 
The only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads . '' 
`` By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry you to the gates of the Emerald City , '' said Glinda , `` for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler . '' 
`` Am I really wonderful ? '' 
asked the Scarecrow . 
`` You are unusual , '' replied Glinda . 
Turning to the Tin Woodman , she asked : `` What will become of you when Dorothy leaves this country ? '' 
He leaned on his axe and thought a moment . 
Then he said , `` The Winkies were very kind to me , and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked Witch died . 
I am fond of the Winkies , and if I could get back again to the country of the West I should like nothing better than to rule over them forever . '' 
`` My second command to the Winged Monkeys , '' said Glinda , `` will be that they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies . 
Your brains may not be so large to look at as those of the Scarecrow , but you are really brighter than he is -- when you are well polished -- and I am sure you will rule the Winkies wisely and well . '' 
Then the Witch looked at the big , shaggy Lion and asked , `` When Dorothy has returned to her own home , what will become of you ? '' 
`` Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads , '' he answered , `` lies a grand old forest , and all the beasts that live there have made me their King . 
If I could only get back to this forest I would pass my life very happily there . '' 
`` My third command to the Winged Monkeys , '' said Glinda , `` shall be to carry you to your forest . 
Then , having used up the powers of the Golden Cap , I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys , that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore . '' 
The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good Witch earnestly for her kindness , and Dorothy exclaimed , [ Illustration ] `` You are certainly as good as you are beautiful ! 
But you have not yet told me how to get back to Kansas . '' 
`` Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert , '' replied Glinda . 
`` If you had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the very first day you came to this country . '' 
`` But then I should not have had my wonderful brains ! '' 
cried the Scarecrow . 
`` I might have passed my whole life in the farmer's cornfield . '' 
`` And I should not have had my lovely heart , '' said the Tin Woodman . 
`` I might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world . '' 
`` And I should have lived a coward forever , '' declared the Lion , `` and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me . '' 
`` This is all true , '' said Dorothy , `` and I am glad I was of use to these good friends . 
But now that each of them has had what he most desired , and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule beside , I think I should like to go back to Kansas . '' 
`` The Silver Shoes , '' said the Good Witch , `` have wonderful powers . 
And one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps , and each step will be made in the wink of an eye . 
All you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go . '' 
`` If that is so , '' said the child , joyfully , `` I will ask them to carry me back to Kansas at once . '' 
She threw her arms around the Lion 's neck and kissed him , patting his big head tenderly . 
Then she kissed the Tin Woodman , who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints . 
But she hugged the soft , stuffed body of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face , and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades . 
Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss , and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself . 
Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms , and having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times , saying , `` Take me home to Aunt Em ! '' 
[ Illustration ] Instantly she was whirling through the air , so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears . 
The Silver Shoes took but three steps , and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was . 
At length , however , she sat up and looked about her . 
`` Good gracious ! '' 
she cried . 
For she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie , and just before her was the new farm-house Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one . 
Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard , and Toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn , barking joyously . 
Dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet . 
For the Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air , and were lost forever in the desert . 
[ Illustration ] . 
Home Again . 
Aunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw Dorothy running toward her . 
`` My darling child ! '' 
she cried , folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses ; `` where in the world did you come from ? '' 
`` From the Land of Oz , '' said Dorothy , gravely . 
`` And here is Toto , too . 
And oh , Aunt Em ! 
I 'm so glad to be at home again ! ''

A STUDY IN SCARLET . 
PART I . 
( _Being a reprint from the reminiscences of_ JOHN H. WATSON , M.D. , _late of the Army Medical Department._ ) [ 2 ] . 
MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES . 
IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London , and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army . 
Having completed my studies there , I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon . 
The regiment was stationed in India at the time , and before I could join it , the second Afghan war had broken out . 
On landing at Bombay , I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes , and was already deep in the enemy 's country . 
I followed , however , with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself , and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety , where I found my regiment , and at once entered upon my new duties . 
The campaign brought honours and promotion to many , but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster . 
I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires , with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand . 
There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet , which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery . 
I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray , my orderly , who threw me across a pack-horse , and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines . 
Worn with pain , and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone , I was removed , with a great train of wounded sufferers , to the base hospital at Peshawar . 
Here I rallied , and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards , and even to bask a little upon the verandah , when I was struck down by enteric fever , that curse of our Indian possessions . 
For months my life was despaired of , and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent , I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England . 
I was dispatched , accordingly , in the troopship `` Orontes , '' and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty , with my health irretrievably ruined , but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it . 
I had neither kith nor kin in England , and was therefore as free as air -- or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be . 
Under such circumstances , I naturally gravitated to London , that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained . 
There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand , leading a comfortless , meaningless existence , and spending such money as I had , considerably more freely than I ought . 
So alarming did the state of my finances become , that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country , or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living . 
Choosing the latter alternative , I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel , and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile . 
On the very day that I had come to this conclusion , I was standing at the Criterion Bar , when some one tapped me on the shoulder , and turning round I recognized young Stamford , who had been a dresser under me at Barts . 
The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man . 
In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine , but now I hailed him with enthusiasm , and he , in his turn , appeared to be delighted to see me . 
In the exuberance of my joy , I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn , and we started off together in a hansom . 
`` Whatever have you been doing with yourself , Watson ? '' 
he asked in undisguised wonder , as we rattled through the crowded London streets . 
`` You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut . '' 
I gave him a short sketch of my adventures , and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination . 
`` Poor devil ! '' 
he said , commiseratingly , after he had listened to my misfortunes . 
`` What are you up to now ? '' 
`` Looking for lodgings . '' 
[ 3 ] I answered . 
`` Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price . '' 
`` That 's a strange thing , '' remarked my companion ; `` you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me . '' 
`` And who was the first ? '' 
I asked . 
`` A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital . 
He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found , and which were too much for his purse . '' 
`` By Jove ! '' 
I cried , `` if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense , I am the very man for him . 
I should prefer having a partner to being alone . '' 
Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass . 
`` You do n't know Sherlock Holmes yet , '' he said ; `` perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion . '' 
`` Why , what is there against him ? '' 
`` Oh , I did n't say there was anything against him . 
He is a little queer in his ideas -- an enthusiast in some branches of science . 
As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough . '' 
`` A medical student , I suppose ? '' 
said I . 
`` No -- I have no idea what he intends to go in for . 
I believe he is well up in anatomy , and he is a first-class chemist ; but , as far as I know , he has never taken out any systematic medical classes . 
His studies are very desultory and eccentric , but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors . '' 
`` Did you never ask him what he was going in for ? '' 
I asked . 
`` No ; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out , though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him . '' 
`` I should like to meet him , '' I said . 
`` If I am to lodge with anyone , I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits . 
I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement . 
I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence . 
How could I meet this friend of yours ? '' 
`` He is sure to be at the laboratory , '' returned my companion . 
`` He either avoids the place for weeks , or else he works there from morning to night . 
If you like , we shall drive round together after luncheon . '' 
`` Certainly , '' I answered , and the conversation drifted away into other channels . 
As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn , Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger . 
`` You must n't blame me if you do n't get on with him , '' he said ; `` I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory . 
You proposed this arrangement , so you must not hold me responsible . '' 
`` If we do n't get on it will be easy to part company , '' I answered . 
`` It seems to me , Stamford , '' I added , looking hard at my companion , `` that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter . 
Is this fellow's temper so formidable , or what is it ? 
Do n't be mealy-mouthed about it . '' 
`` It is not easy to express the inexpressible , '' he answered with a laugh . 
`` Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes -- it approaches to cold-bloodedness . 
I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid , not out of malevolence , you understand , but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects . 
To do him justice , I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness . 
He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge . '' 
`` Very right too . '' 
`` Yes , but it may be pushed to excess . 
When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick , it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape . '' 
`` Beating the subjects ! '' 
`` Yes , to verify how far bruises may be produced after death . 
I saw him at it with my own eyes . '' 
`` And yet you say he is not a medical student ? '' 
`` No . 
Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are . 
But here we are , and you must form your own impressions about him . '' 
As he spoke , we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door , which opened into a wing of the great hospital . 
It was familiar ground to me , and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors . 
Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory . 
This was a lofty chamber , lined and littered with countless bottles . 
Broad , low tables were scattered about , which bristled with retorts , test-tubes , and little Bunsen lamps , with their blue flickering flames . 
There was only one student in the room , who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work . 
At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure . 
`` I 've found it ! 
I've found it , '' he shouted to my companion , running towards us with a test-tube in his hand . 
`` I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin , [ 4 ] and by nothing else . '' 
Had he discovered a gold mine , greater delight could not have shone upon his features . 
`` Dr. Watson , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , '' said Stamford , introducing us . 
`` How are you ? '' 
he said cordially , gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit . 
`` You have been in Afghanistan , I perceive . '' 
`` How on earth did you know that ? '' 
I asked in astonishment . 
`` Never mind , '' said he , chuckling to himself . 
`` The question now is about hoemoglobin . 
No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine ? '' 
`` It is interesting , chemically , no doubt , '' I answered , `` but practically -- -- '' `` Why , man , it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years . 
Do n't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains . 
Come over here now ! '' 
He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness , and drew me over to the table at which he had been working . 
`` Let us have some fresh blood , '' he said , digging a long bodkin into his finger , and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette . 
`` Now , I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water . 
You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water . 
The proportion of blood can not be more than one in a million . 
I have no doubt , however , that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction . '' 
As he spoke , he threw into the vessel a few white crystals , and then added some drops of a transparent fluid . 
In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour , and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar . 
`` Ha ! 
ha ! '' 
he cried , clapping his hands , and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy . 
`` What do you think of that ? '' 
`` It seems to be a very delicate test , '' I remarked . 
`` Beautiful ! 
beautiful ! 
The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain . 
So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles . 
The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old . 
Now , this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new . 
Had this test been invented , there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
I murmured . 
`` Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point . 
A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed . 
His linen or clothes are examined , and brownish stains discovered upon them . 
Are they blood stains , or mud stains , or rust stains , or fruit stains , or what are they ? 
That is a question which has puzzled many an expert , and why ? 
Because there was no reliable test . 
Now we have the Sherlock Holmes ' test , and there will no longer be any difficulty . '' 
His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke , and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination . 
`` You are to be congratulated , '' I remarked , considerably surprised at his enthusiasm . 
`` There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year . 
He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence . 
Then there was Mason of Bradford , and the notorious Muller , and Lefevre of Montpellier , and Samson of New Orleans . 
I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive . '' 
`` You seem to be a walking calendar of crime , '' said Stamford with a laugh . 
`` You might start a paper on those lines . 
Call it the 'Police News of the Past . ' '' 
`` Very interesting reading it might be made , too , '' remarked Sherlock Holmes , sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger . 
`` I have to be careful , '' he continued , turning to me with a smile , `` for I dabble with poisons a good deal . '' 
He held out his hand as he spoke , and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster , and discoloured with strong acids . 
`` We came here on business , '' said Stamford , sitting down on a high three-legged stool , and pushing another one in my direction with his foot . 
`` My friend here wants to take diggings , and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you , I thought that I had better bring you together . '' 
Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me . 
`` I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street , '' he said , `` which would suit us down to the ground . 
You do n't mind the smell of strong tobacco , I hope ? '' 
`` I always smoke 'ship 's ' myself , '' I answered . 
`` That 's good enough . 
I generally have chemicals about , and occasionally do experiments . 
Would that annoy you ? '' 
`` By no means . '' 
`` Let me see -- what are my other shortcomings . 
I get in the dumps at times , and do n't open my mouth for days on end . 
You must not think I am sulky when I do that . 
Just let me alone , and I 'll soon be right . 
What have you to confess now ? 
It 's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together . '' 
I laughed at this cross-examination . 
`` I keep a bull pup , '' I said , `` and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken , and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours , and I am extremely lazy . 
I have another set of vices when I 'm well , but those are the principal ones at present . '' 
`` Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows ? '' 
he asked , anxiously . 
`` It depends on the player , '' I answered . 
`` A well-played violin is a treat for the gods -- a badly-played one -- -- '' `` Oh , that 's all right , '' he cried , with a merry laugh . 
`` I think we may consider the thing as settled -- that is , if the rooms are agreeable to you . '' 
`` When shall we see them ? '' 
`` Call for me here at noon to-morrow , and we 'll go together and settle everything , '' he answered . 
`` All right -- noon exactly , '' said I , shaking his hand . 
We left him working among his chemicals , and we walked together towards my hotel . 
`` By the way , '' I asked suddenly , stopping and turning upon Stamford , `` how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan ? '' 
My companion smiled an enigmatical smile . 
`` That 's just his little peculiarity , '' he said . 
`` A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out . '' 
`` Oh ! 
a mystery is it ? '' 
I cried , rubbing my hands . 
`` This is very piquant . 
I am much obliged to you for bringing us together . 
'The proper study of mankind is man , ' you know . '' 
`` You must study him , then , '' Stamford said , as he bade me good-bye . 
`` You 'll find him a knotty problem , though . 
I 'll wager he learns more about you than you about him . 
Good-bye . '' 
`` Good-bye , '' I answered , and strolled on to my hotel , considerably interested in my new acquaintance . 
. 
THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION . 
WE met next day as he had arranged , and inspected the rooms at No . 
221B , [ 5 ] Baker Street , of which he had spoken at our meeting . 
They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room , cheerfully furnished , and illuminated by two broad windows . 
So desirable in every way were the apartments , and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us , that the bargain was concluded upon the spot , and we at once entered into possession . 
That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel , and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus . 
For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage . 
That done , we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings . 
Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with . 
He was quiet in his ways , and his habits were regular . 
It was rare for him to be up after ten at night , and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning . 
Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory , sometimes in the dissecting-rooms , and occasionally in long walks , which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City . 
Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him ; but now and again a reaction would seize him , and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room , hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night . 
On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy , vacant expression in his eyes , that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic , had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion . 
As the weeks went by , my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life , gradually deepened and increased . 
His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer . 
In height he was rather over six feet , and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller . 
His eyes were sharp and piercing , save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded ; and his thin , hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision . 
His chin , too , had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination . 
His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals , yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch , as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments . 
The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody , when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity , and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself . 
Before pronouncing judgment , however , be it remembered , how objectless was my life , and how little there was to engage my attention . 
My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial , and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence . 
Under these circumstances , I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion , and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it . 
He was not studying medicine . 
He had himself , in reply to a question , confirmed Stamford 's opinion upon that point . 
Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world . 
Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable , and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me . 
Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view . 
Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning . 
No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so . 
His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge . 
Of contemporary literature , philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing . 
Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle , he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done . 
My surprise reached a climax , however , when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System . 
That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it . 
`` You appear to be astonished , '' he said , smiling at my expression of surprise . 
`` Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it . '' 
`` To forget it ! '' 
`` You see , '' he explained , `` I consider that a man 's brain originally is like a little empty attic , and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose . 
A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across , so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out , or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it . 
Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic . 
He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work , but of these he has a large assortment , and all in the most perfect order . 
It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent . 
Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before . 
It is of the highest importance , therefore , not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones . '' 
`` But the Solar System ! '' 
I protested . 
`` What the deuce is it to me ? '' 
he interrupted impatiently ; `` you say that we go round the sun . 
If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work . '' 
I was on the point of asking him what that work might be , but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one . 
I pondered over our short conversation , however , and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it . 
He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object . 
Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him . 
I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed . 
I even took a pencil and jotted them down . 
I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it . 
It ran in this way -- SHERLOCK HOLMES -- his limits . 
1 . 
Knowledge of Literature. -- Nil . 
2 . 
Philosophy. -- Nil . 
3 . 
Astronomy. -- Nil . 
4 . 
Politics. -- Feeble . 
5 . 
Botany. -- Variable . 
Well up in belladonna , opium , and poisons generally . 
Knows nothing of practical gardening . 
6 . 
Geology. -- Practical , but limited . 
Tells at a glance different soils from each other . 
After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers , and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received them . 
7 . 
Chemistry. -- Profound . 
8 . 
Anatomy. -- Accurate , but unsystematic . 
9 . 
Sensational Literature. -- Immense . 
He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century . 
10 . 
Plays the violin well . 
11 . 
Is an expert singlestick player , boxer , and swordsman . 
12 . 
Has a good practical knowledge of British law . 
When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair . 
`` If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments , and discovering a calling which needs them all , '' I said to myself , `` I may as well give up the attempt at once . '' 
I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin . 
These were very remarkable , but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments . 
That he could play pieces , and difficult pieces , I knew well , because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn 's Lieder , and other favourites . 
When left to himself , however , he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air . 
Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening , he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee . 
Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy . 
Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful . 
Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him , but whether the music aided those thoughts , or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine . 
I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience . 
During the first week or so we had no callers , and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself . 
Presently , however , I found that he had many acquaintances , and those in the most different classes of society . 
There was one little sallow rat-faced , dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade , and who came three or four times in a single week . 
One morning a young girl called , fashionably dressed , and stayed for half an hour or more . 
The same afternoon brought a grey-headed , seedy visitor , looking like a Jew pedlar , who appeared to me to be much excited , and who was closely followed by a slip-shod elderly woman . 
On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion ; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform . 
When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance , Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room , and I would retire to my bed-room . 
He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience . 
`` I have to use this room as a place of business , '' he said , `` and these people are my clients . '' 
Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question , and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me . 
I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it , but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord . 
It was upon the 4th of March , as I have good reason to remember , that I rose somewhat earlier than usual , and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast . 
The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared . 
With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready . 
Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it , while my companion munched silently at his toast . 
One of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading , and I naturally began to run my eye through it . 
Its somewhat ambitious title was `` The Book of Life , '' and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way . 
It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity . 
The reasoning was close and intense , but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated . 
The writer claimed by a momentary expression , a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye , to fathom a man 's inmost thoughts . 
Deceit , according to him , was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis . 
His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid . 
So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer . 
`` From a drop of water , '' said the writer , `` a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other . 
So all life is a great chain , the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it . 
Like all other arts , the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it . 
Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties , let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems . 
Let him , on meeting a fellow-mortal , learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man , and the trade or profession to which he belongs . 
Puerile as such an exercise may seem , it sharpens the faculties of observation , and teaches one where to look and what to look for . 
By a man 's finger nails , by his coat-sleeve , by his boot , by his trouser knees , by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb , by his expression , by his shirt cuffs -- by each of these things a man 's calling is plainly revealed . 
That all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable . '' 
`` What ineffable twaddle ! '' 
I cried , slapping the magazine down on the table , `` I never read such rubbish in my life . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked Sherlock Holmes . 
`` Why , this article , '' I said , pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat down to my breakfast . 
`` I see that you have read it since you have marked it . 
I do n't deny that it is smartly written . 
It irritates me though . 
It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study . 
It is not practical . 
I should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground , and asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers . 
I would lay a thousand to one against him . '' 
`` You would lose your money , '' Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly . 
`` As for the article I wrote it myself . '' 
`` You ! '' 
`` Yes , I have a turn both for observation and for deduction . 
The theories which I have expressed there , and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical -- so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese . '' 
`` And how ? '' 
I asked involuntarily . 
`` Well , I have a trade of my own . 
I suppose I am the only one in the world . 
I 'm a consulting detective , if you can understand what that is . 
Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones . 
When these fellows are at fault they come to me , and I manage to put them on the right scent . 
They lay all the evidence before me , and I am generally able , by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime , to set them straight . 
There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds , and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends , it is odd if you ca n't unravel the thousand and first . 
Lestrade is a well-known detective . 
He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case , and that was what brought him here . '' 
`` And these other people ? '' 
`` They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies . 
They are all people who are in trouble about something , and want a little enlightening . 
I listen to their story , they listen to my comments , and then I pocket my fee . '' 
`` But do you mean to say , '' I said , `` that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of , although they have seen every detail for themselves ? '' 
`` Quite so . 
I have a kind of intuition that way . 
Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex . 
Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes . 
You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem , and which facilitates matters wonderfully . 
Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn , are invaluable to me in practical work . 
Observation with me is second nature . 
You appeared to be surprised when I told you , on our first meeting , that you had come from Afghanistan . '' 
`` You were told , no doubt . '' 
`` Nothing of the sort . 
I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan . 
From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind , that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps . 
There were such steps , however . 
The train of reasoning ran , 'Here is a gentleman of a medical type , but with the air of a military man . 
Clearly an army doctor , then . 
He has just come from the tropics , for his face is dark , and that is not the natural tint of his skin , for his wrists are fair . 
He has undergone hardship and sickness , as his haggard face says clearly . 
His left arm has been injured . 
He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner . 
Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded ? 
Clearly in Afghanistan . ' 
The whole train of thought did not occupy a second . 
I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan , and you were astonished . '' 
`` It is simple enough as you explain it , '' I said , smiling . 
`` You remind me of Edgar Allen Poe 's Dupin . 
I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories . '' 
Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe . 
`` No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin , '' he observed . 
`` Now , in my opinion , Dupin was a very inferior fellow . 
That trick of his of breaking in on his friends ' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour 's silence is really very showy and superficial . 
He had some analytical genius , no doubt ; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine . '' 
`` Have you read Gaboriau 's works ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective ? '' 
Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically . 
`` Lecoq was a miserable bungler , '' he said , in an angry voice ; `` he had only one thing to recommend him , and that was his energy . 
That book made me positively ill . 
The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner . 
I could have done it in twenty-four hours . 
Lecoq took six months or so . 
It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid . '' 
I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style . 
I walked over to the window , and stood looking out into the busy street . 
`` This fellow may be very clever , '' I said to myself , `` but he is certainly very conceited . '' 
`` There are no crimes and no criminals in these days , '' he said , querulously . 
`` What is the use of having brains in our profession . 
I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous . 
No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done . 
And what is the result ? 
There is no crime to detect , or , at most , some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it . '' 
I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation . 
I thought it best to change the topic . 
`` I wonder what that fellow is looking for ? '' 
I asked , pointing to a stalwart , plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street , looking anxiously at the numbers . 
He had a large blue envelope in his hand , and was evidently the bearer of a message . 
`` You mean the retired sergeant of Marines , '' said Sherlock Holmes . 
`` Brag and bounce ! '' 
thought I to myself . 
`` He knows that I can not verify his guess . '' 
The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door , and ran rapidly across the roadway . 
We heard a loud knock , a deep voice below , and heavy steps ascending the stair . 
`` For Mr. Sherlock Holmes , '' he said , stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter . 
Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him . 
He little thought of this when he made that random shot . 
`` May I ask , my lad , '' I said , in the blandest voice , `` what your trade may be ? '' 
`` Commissionaire , sir , '' he said , gruffly . 
`` Uniform away for repairs . '' 
`` And you were ? '' 
I asked , with a slightly malicious glance at my companion . 
`` A sergeant , sir , Royal Marine Light Infantry , sir . 
No answer ? 
Right , sir . '' 
He clicked his heels together , raised his hand in a salute , and was gone . 
. 
THE LAURISTON GARDEN MYSTERY [ 6 ] I CONFESS that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion 's theories . 
My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously . 
There still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind , however , that the whole thing was a pre-arranged episode , intended to dazzle me , though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension . 
When I looked at him he had finished reading the note , and his eyes had assumed the vacant , lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction . 
`` How in the world did you deduce that ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Deduce what ? '' 
said he , petulantly . 
`` Why , that he was a retired sergeant of Marines . '' 
`` I have no time for trifles , '' he answered , brusquely ; then with a smile , `` Excuse my rudeness . 
You broke the thread of my thoughts ; but perhaps it is as well . 
So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of Marines ? '' 
`` No , indeed . '' 
`` It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it . 
If you were asked to prove that two and two made four , you might find some difficulty , and yet you are quite sure of the fact . 
Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow 's hand . 
That smacked of the sea . 
He had a military carriage , however , and regulation side whiskers . 
There we have the marine . 
He was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command . 
You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane . 
A steady , respectable , middle-aged man , too , on the face of him -- all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant . '' 
`` Wonderful ! '' 
I ejaculated . 
`` Commonplace , '' said Holmes , though I thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration . 
`` I said just now that there were no criminals . 
It appears that I am wrong -- look at this ! '' 
He threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought . 
[ 7 ] `` Why , '' I cried , as I cast my eye over it , `` this is terrible ! '' 
`` It does seem to be a little out of the common , '' he remarked , calmly . 
`` Would you mind reading it to me aloud ? '' 
This is the letter which I read to him -- -- `` MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES , -- `` There has been a bad business during the night at 3 , Lauriston Gardens , off the Brixton Road . 
Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning , and as the house was an empty one , suspected that something was amiss . 
He found the door open , and in the front room , which is bare of furniture , discovered the body of a gentleman , well dressed , and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of 'Enoch J. Drebber , Cleveland , Ohio , U.S.A. ' There had been no robbery , nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death . 
There are marks of blood in the room , but there is no wound upon his person . 
We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house ; indeed , the whole affair is a puzzler . 
If you can come round to the house any time before twelve , you will find me there . 
I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you . 
If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details , and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion . 
Yours faithfully , `` TOBIAS GREGSON . '' 
`` Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders , '' my friend remarked ; `` he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot . 
They are both quick and energetic , but conventional -- shockingly so . 
They have their knives into one another , too . 
They are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties . 
There will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent . '' 
I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on . 
`` Surely there is not a moment to be lost , '' I cried , `` shall I go and order you a cab ? '' 
`` I 'm not sure about whether I shall go . 
I am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather -- that is , when the fit is on me , for I can be spry enough at times . '' 
`` Why , it is just such a chance as you have been longing for . '' 
`` My dear fellow , what does it matter to me . 
Supposing I unravel the whole matter , you may be sure that Gregson , Lestrade , and Co. will pocket all the credit . 
That comes of being an unofficial personage . '' 
`` But he begs you to help him . '' 
`` Yes . 
He knows that I am his superior , and acknowledges it to me ; but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person . 
However , we may as well go and have a look . 
I shall work it out on my own hook . 
I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else . 
Come on ! '' 
He hustled on his overcoat , and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one . 
`` Get your hat , '' he said . 
`` You wish me to come ? '' 
`` Yes , if you have nothing better to do . '' 
A minute later we were both in a hansom , driving furiously for the Brixton Road . 
It was a foggy , cloudy morning , and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops , looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath . 
My companion was in the best of spirits , and prattled away about Cremona fiddles , and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati . 
As for myself , I was silent , for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged , depressed my spirits . 
`` You do n't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand , '' I said at last , interrupting Holmes ' musical disquisition . 
`` No data yet , '' he answered . 
`` It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence . 
It biases the judgment . '' 
`` You will have your data soon , '' I remarked , pointing with my finger ; `` this is the Brixton Road , and that is the house , if I am not very much mistaken . '' 
`` So it is . 
Stop , driver , stop ! '' 
We were still a hundred yards or so from it , but he insisted upon our alighting , and we finished our journey upon foot . 
Number 3 , Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look . 
It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street , two being occupied and two empty . 
The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows , which were blank and dreary , save that here and there a `` To Let '' card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes . 
A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street , and was traversed by a narrow pathway , yellowish in colour , and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel . 
The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night . 
The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top , and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable , surrounded by a small knot of loafers , who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within . 
I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery . 
Nothing appeared to be further from his intention . 
With an air of nonchalance which , under the circumstances , seemed to me to border upon affectation , he lounged up and down the pavement , and gazed vacantly at the ground , the sky , the opposite houses and the line of railings . 
Having finished his scrutiny , he proceeded slowly down the path , or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path , keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground . 
Twice he stopped , and once I saw him smile , and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction . 
There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil , but since the police had been coming and going over it , I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it . 
Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties , that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me . 
At the door of the house we were met by a tall , white-faced , flaxen-haired man , with a notebook in his hand , who rushed forward and wrung my companion 's hand with effusion . 
`` It is indeed kind of you to come , '' he said , `` I have had everything left untouched . '' 
`` Except that ! '' 
my friend answered , pointing at the pathway . 
`` If a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess . 
No doubt , however , you had drawn your own conclusions , Gregson , before you permitted this . '' 
`` I have had so much to do inside the house , '' the detective said evasively . 
`` My colleague , Mr. Lestrade , is here . 
I had relied upon him to look after this . '' 
Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically . 
`` With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground , there will not be much for a third party to find out , '' he said . 
Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way . 
`` I think we have done all that can be done , '' he answered ; `` it 's a queer case though , and I knew your taste for such things . '' 
`` You did not come here in a cab ? '' 
asked Sherlock Holmes . 
`` No , sir . '' 
`` Nor Lestrade ? '' 
`` No , sir . '' 
`` Then let us go and look at the room . '' 
With which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house , followed by Gregson , whose features expressed his astonishment . 
A short passage , bare planked and dusty , led to the kitchen and offices . 
Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right . 
One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks . 
The other belonged to the dining-room , which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred . 
Holmes walked in , and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires . 
It was a large square room , looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture . 
A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls , but it was blotched in places with mildew , and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down , exposing the yellow plaster beneath . 
Opposite the door was a showy fireplace , surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble . 
On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle . 
The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain , giving a dull grey tinge to everything , which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment . 
All these details I observed afterwards . 
At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards , with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling . 
It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age , middle-sized , broad shouldered , with crisp curling black hair , and a short stubbly beard . 
He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat , with light-coloured trousers , and immaculate collar and cuffs . 
A top hat , well brushed and trim , was placed upon the floor beside him . 
His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad , while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one . 
On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror , and as it seemed to me , of hatred , such as I have never seen upon human features . 
This malignant and terrible contortion , combined with the low forehead , blunt nose , and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance , which was increased by his writhing , unnatural posture . 
I have seen death in many forms , but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment , which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London . 
Lestrade , lean and ferret-like as ever , was standing by the doorway , and greeted my companion and myself . 
`` This case will make a stir , sir , '' he remarked . 
`` It beats anything I have seen , and I am no chicken . '' 
`` There is no clue ? '' 
said Gregson . 
`` None at all , '' chimed in Lestrade . 
Sherlock Holmes approached the body , and , kneeling down , examined it intently . 
`` You are sure that there is no wound ? '' 
he asked , pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round . 
`` Positive ! '' 
cried both detectives . 
`` Then , of course , this blood belongs to a second individual -- [ 8 ] presumably the murderer , if murder has been committed . 
It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen , in Utrecht , in the year '34 . 
Do you remember the case , Gregson ? '' 
`` No , sir . '' 
`` Read it up -- you really should . 
There is nothing new under the sun . 
It has all been done before . '' 
As he spoke , his nimble fingers were flying here , there , and everywhere , feeling , pressing , unbuttoning , examining , while his eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon . 
So swiftly was the examination made , that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted . 
Finally , he sniffed the dead man 's lips , and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots . 
`` He has not been moved at all ? '' 
he asked . 
`` No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination . '' 
`` You can take him to the mortuary now , '' he said . 
`` There is nothing more to be learned . '' 
Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand . 
At his call they entered the room , and the stranger was lifted and carried out . 
As they raised him , a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor . 
Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes . 
`` There 's been a woman here , '' he cried . 
`` It 's a woman 's wedding-ring . '' 
He held it out , as he spoke , upon the palm of his hand . 
We all gathered round him and gazed at it . 
There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride . 
`` This complicates matters , '' said Gregson . 
`` Heaven knows , they were complicated enough before . '' 
`` You 're sure it does n't simplify them ? '' 
observed Holmes . 
`` There's nothing to be learned by staring at it . 
What did you find in his pockets ? '' 
`` We have it all here , '' said Gregson , pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs . 
`` A gold watch , No . 
97163 , by Barraud , of London . 
Gold Albert chain , very heavy and solid . 
Gold ring , with masonic device . 
Gold pin -- bull-dog 's head , with rubies as eyes . 
Russian leather card-case , with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland , corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen . 
No purse , but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen . 
Pocket edition of Boccaccio 's 'Decameron , ' with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the fly-leaf . 
Two letters -- one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson . '' 
`` At what address ? '' 
`` American Exchange , Strand -- to be left till called for . 
They are both from the Guion Steamship Company , and refer to the sailing of their boats from Liverpool . 
It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York . '' 
`` Have you made any inquiries as to this man , Stangerson ? '' 
`` I did it at once , sir , '' said Gregson . 
`` I have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers , and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange , but he has not returned yet . '' 
`` Have you sent to Cleveland ? '' 
`` We telegraphed this morning . '' 
`` How did you word your inquiries ? '' 
`` We simply detailed the circumstances , and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us . '' 
`` You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial ? '' 
`` I asked about Stangerson . '' 
`` Nothing else ? 
Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge ? 
Will you not telegraph again ? '' 
`` I have said all I have to say , '' said Gregson , in an offended voice . 
Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself , and appeared to be about to make some remark , when Lestrade , who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall , reappeared upon the scene , rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner . 
`` Mr. Gregson , '' he said , `` I have just made a discovery of the highest importance , and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls . '' 
The little man 's eyes sparkled as he spoke , and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague . 
`` Come here , '' he said , bustling back into the room , the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate . 
`` Now , stand there ! '' 
He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall . 
`` Look at that ! '' 
he said , triumphantly . 
I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts . 
In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off , leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering . 
Across this bare space there was scrawled in blood-red letters a single word -- RACHE . 
`` What do you think of that ? '' 
cried the detective , with the air of a showman exhibiting his show . 
`` This was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room , and no one thought of looking there . 
The murderer has written it with his or her own blood . 
See this smear where it has trickled down the wall ! 
That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow . 
Why was that corner chosen to write it on ? 
I will tell you . 
See that candle on the mantelpiece . 
It was lit at the time , and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall . '' 
`` And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it ? '' 
asked Gregson in a depreciatory voice . 
`` Mean ? 
Why , it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel , but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish . 
You mark my words , when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it . 
It 's all very well for you to laugh , Mr. Sherlock Holmes . 
You may be very smart and clever , but the old hound is the best , when all is said and done . '' 
`` I really beg your pardon ! '' 
said my companion , who had ruffled the little man 's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter . 
`` You certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out , and , as you say , it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night 's mystery . 
I have not had time to examine this room yet , but with your permission I shall do so now . '' 
As he spoke , he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket . 
With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room , sometimes stopping , occasionally kneeling , and once lying flat upon his face . 
So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence , for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time , keeping up a running fire of exclamations , groans , whistles , and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope . 
As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert , whining in its eagerness , until it comes across the lost scent . 
For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches , measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me , and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner . 
In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor , and packed it away in an envelope . 
Finally , he examined with his glass the word upon the wall , going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness . 
This done , he appeared to be satisfied , for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket . 
`` They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains , '' he remarked with a smile . 
`` It 's a very bad definition , but it does apply to detective work . '' 
Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres [ 9 ] of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt . 
They evidently failed to appreciate the fact , which I had begun to realize , that Sherlock Holmes ' smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end . 
`` What do you think of it , sir ? '' 
they both asked . 
`` It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you , '' remarked my friend . 
`` You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere . '' 
There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke . 
`` If you will let me know how your investigations go , '' he continued , `` I shall be happy to give you any help I can . 
In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found the body . 
Can you give me his name and address ? '' 
Lestrade glanced at his note-book . 
`` John Rance , '' he said . 
`` He is off duty now . 
You will find him at 46 , Audley Court , Kennington Park Gate . '' 
Holmes took a note of the address . 
`` Come along , Doctor , '' he said ; `` we shall go and look him up . 
I 'll tell you one thing which may help you in the case , '' he continued , turning to the two detectives . 
`` There has been murder done , and the murderer was a man . 
He was more than six feet high , was in the prime of life , had small feet for his height , wore coarse , square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar . 
He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab , which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg . 
In all probability the murderer had a florid face , and the finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long . 
These are only a few indications , but they may assist you . '' 
Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile . 
`` If this man was murdered , how was it done ? '' 
asked the former . 
`` Poison , '' said Sherlock Holmes curtly , and strode off . 
`` One other thing , Lestrade , '' he added , turning round at the door : `` 'Rache , ' is the German for 'revenge ; ' so do n't lose your time looking for Miss Rachel . '' 
With which Parthian shot he walked away , leaving the two rivals open-mouthed behind him . 
. 
WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL . 
IT was one o'clock when we left No . 
3 , Lauriston Gardens . 
Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office , whence he dispatched a long telegram . 
He then hailed a cab , and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade . 
`` There is nothing like first hand evidence , '' he remarked ; `` as a matter of fact , my mind is entirely made up upon the case , but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned . '' 
`` You amaze me , Holmes , '' said I . 
`` Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave . '' 
`` There 's no room for a mistake , '' he answered . 
`` The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb . 
Now , up to last night , we have had no rain for a week , so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night . 
There were the marks of the horse's hoofs , too , the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three , showing that that was a new shoe . 
Since the cab was there after the rain began , and was not there at any time during the morning -- I have Gregson 's word for that -- it follows that it must have been there during the night , and , therefore , that it brought those two individuals to the house . '' 
`` That seems simple enough , '' said I ; `` but how about the other man's height ? '' 
`` Why , the height of a man , in nine cases out of ten , can be told from the length of his stride . 
It is a simple calculation enough , though there is no use my boring you with figures . 
I had this fellow 's stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within . 
Then I had a way of checking my calculation . 
When a man writes on a wall , his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes . 
Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground . 
It was child 's play . '' 
`` And his age ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Well , if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort , he ca n't be quite in the sere and yellow . 
That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across . 
Patent-leather boots had gone round , and Square-toes had hopped over . 
There is no mystery about it at all . 
I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article . 
Is there anything else that puzzles you ? '' 
`` The finger nails and the Trichinopoly , '' I suggested . 
`` The writing on the wall was done with a man 's forefinger dipped in blood . 
My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it , which would not have been the case if the man's nail had been trimmed . 
I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor . 
It was dark in colour and flakey -- such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly . 
I have made a special study of cigar ashes -- in fact , I have written a monograph upon the subject . 
I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand , either of cigar or of tobacco . 
It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type . '' 
`` And the florid face ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Ah , that was a more daring shot , though I have no doubt that I was right . 
You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair . '' 
I passed my hand over my brow . 
`` My head is in a whirl , '' I remarked ; `` the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows . 
How came these two men -- if there were two men -- into an empty house ? 
What has become of the cabman who drove them ? 
How could one man compel another to take poison ? 
Where did the blood come from ? 
What was the object of the murderer , since robbery had no part in it ? 
How came the woman 's ring there ? 
Above all , why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping ? 
I confess that I can not see any possible way of reconciling all these facts . '' 
My companion smiled approvingly . 
`` You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well , '' he said . 
`` There is much that is still obscure , though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts . 
As to poor Lestrade 's discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track , by suggesting Socialism and secret societies . 
It was not done by a German . 
The A , if you noticed , was printed somewhat after the German fashion . 
Now , a real German invariably prints in the Latin character , so that we may safely say that this was not written by one , but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part . 
It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel . 
I 'm not going to tell you much more of the case , Doctor . 
You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick , and if I show you too much of my method of working , you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all . '' 
`` I shall never do that , '' I answered ; `` you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world . '' 
My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words , and the earnest way in which I uttered them . 
I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty . 
`` I 'll tell you one other thing , '' he said . 
`` Patent leathers [ 10 ] and Square-toes came in the same cab , and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible -- arm-in-arm , in all probability . 
When they got inside they walked up and down the room -- or rather , Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down . 
I could read all that in the dust ; and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited . 
That is shown by the increased length of his strides . 
He was talking all the while , and working himself up , no doubt , into a fury . 
Then the tragedy occurred . 
I 've told you all I know myself now , for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture . 
We have a good working basis , however , on which to start . 
We must hurry up , for I want to go to Halle 's concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon . '' 
This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways . 
In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand . 
`` That 's Audley Court in there , '' he said , pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick . 
`` You 'll find me here when you come back . '' 
Audley Court was not an attractive locality . 
The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings . 
We picked our way among groups of dirty children , and through lines of discoloured linen , until we came to Number 46 , the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved . 
On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed , and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming . 
He appeared presently , looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers . 
`` I made my report at the office , '' he said . 
Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively . 
`` We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips , '' he said . 
`` I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can , '' the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk . 
`` Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred . '' 
Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa , and knitted his brows as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative . 
`` I 'll tell it ye from the beginning , '' he said . 
`` My time is from ten at night to six in the morning . 
At eleven there was a fight at the 'White Hart ' ; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat . 
At one o'clock it began to rain , and I met Harry Murcher -- him who has the Holland Grove beat -- and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin ' . 
Presently -- maybe about two or a little after -- I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road . 
It was precious dirty and lonely . 
Not a soul did I meet all the way down , though a cab or two went past me . 
I was a strollin ' down , thinkin' between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be , when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house . 
Now , I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who wo n't have the drains seen to , though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o ' typhoid fever . 
I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window , and I suspected as something was wrong . 
When I got to the door -- -- '' `` You stopped , and then walked back to the garden gate , '' my companion interrupted . 
`` What did you do that for ? '' 
Rance gave a violent jump , and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features . 
`` Why , that 's true , sir , '' he said ; `` though how you come to know it , Heaven only knows . 
Ye see , when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome , that I thought I 'd be none the worse for some one with me . 
I ai n't afeared of anything on this side o ' the grave ; but I thought that maybe it was him that died o ' the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him . 
The thought gave me a kind o ' turn , and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher 's lantern , but there was n't no sign of him nor of anyone else . '' 
`` There was no one in the street ? '' 
`` Not a livin ' soul , sir , nor as much as a dog . 
Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open . 
All was quiet inside , so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin ' . 
There was a candle flickerin ' on the mantelpiece -- a red wax one -- and by its light I saw -- -- '' `` Yes , I know all that you saw . 
You walked round the room several times , and you knelt down by the body , and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door , and then -- -- '' John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes . 
`` Where was you hid to see all that ? '' 
he cried . 
`` It seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should . '' 
Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable . 
`` Do n't get arresting me for the murder , '' he said . 
`` I am one of the hounds and not the wolf ; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that . 
Go on , though . 
What did you do next ? '' 
Rance resumed his seat , without however losing his mystified expression . 
`` I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle . 
That brought Murcher and two more to the spot . '' 
`` Was the street empty then ? '' 
`` Well , it was , as far as anybody that could be of any good goes . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
The constable 's features broadened into a grin . 
`` I 've seen many a drunk chap in my time , '' he said , `` but never anyone so cryin ' drunk as that cove . 
He was at the gate when I came out , a-leanin ' up agin the railings , and a-singin ' at the pitch o ' his lungs about Columbine's New-fangled Banner , or some such stuff . 
He could n't stand , far less help . '' 
`` What sort of a man was he ? '' 
asked Sherlock Holmes . 
John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression . 
`` He was an uncommon drunk sort o ' man , '' he said . 
`` He 'd ha ' found hisself in the station if we had n't been so took up . '' 
`` His face -- his dress -- did n't you notice them ? '' 
Holmes broke in impatiently . 
`` I should think I did notice them , seeing that I had to prop him up -- me and Murcher between us . 
He was a long chap , with a red face , the lower part muffled round -- -- '' `` That will do , '' cried Holmes . 
`` What became of him ? '' 
`` We 'd enough to do without lookin ' after him , '' the policeman said , in an aggrieved voice . 
`` I 'll wager he found his way home all right . '' 
`` How was he dressed ? '' 
`` A brown overcoat . '' 
`` Had he a whip in his hand ? '' 
`` A whip -- no . '' 
`` He must have left it behind , '' muttered my companion . 
`` You did n't happen to see or hear a cab after that ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` There 's a half-sovereign for you , '' my companion said , standing up and taking his hat . 
`` I am afraid , Rance , that you will never rise in the force . 
That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament . 
You might have gained your sergeant 's stripes last night . 
The man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery , and whom we are seeking . 
There is no use of arguing about it now ; I tell you that it is so . 
Come along , Doctor . '' 
We started off for the cab together , leaving our informant incredulous , but obviously uncomfortable . 
`` The blundering fool , '' Holmes said , bitterly , as we drove back to our lodgings . 
`` Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck , and not taking advantage of it . '' 
`` I am rather in the dark still . 
It is true that the description of this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery . 
But why should he come back to the house after leaving it ? 
That is not the way of criminals . '' 
`` The ring , man , the ring : that was what he came back for . 
If we have no other way of catching him , we can always bait our line with the ring . 
I shall have him , Doctor -- I 'll lay you two to one that I have him . 
I must thank you for it all . 
I might not have gone but for you , and so have missed the finest study I ever came across : a study in scarlet , eh ? 
Why should n't we use a little art jargon . 
There 's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life , and our duty is to unravel it , and isolate it , and expose every inch of it . 
And now for lunch , and then for Norman Neruda . 
Her attack and her bowing are splendid . 
What 's that little thing of Chopin 's she plays so magnificently : Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay . '' 
Leaning back in the cab , this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind . 
. 
OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR . 
OUR morning 's exertions had been too much for my weak health , and I was tired out in the afternoon . 
After Holmes ' departure for the concert , I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours ' sleep . 
It was a useless attempt . 
My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred , and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it . 
Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man . 
So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world . 
If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type , they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber , of Cleveland . 
Still I recognized that justice must be done , and that the depravity of the victim was no condonment [ 11 ] in the eyes of the law . 
The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion's hypothesis , that the man had been poisoned , appear . 
I remembered how he had sniffed his lips , and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea . 
Then , again , if not poison , what had caused the man 's death , since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation ? 
But , on the other hand , whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor ? 
There were no signs of a struggle , nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist . 
As long as all these questions were unsolved , I felt that sleep would be no easy matter , either for Holmes or myself . 
His quiet self-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts , though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture . 
He was very late in returning -- so late , that I knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time . 
Dinner was on the table before he appeared . 
`` It was magnificent , '' he said , as he took his seat . 
`` Do you remember what Darwin says about music ? 
He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at . 
Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it . 
There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood . '' 
`` That 's rather a broad idea , '' I remarked . 
`` One 's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature , '' he answered . 
`` What 's the matter ? 
You 're not looking quite yourself . 
This Brixton Road affair has upset you . '' 
`` To tell the truth , it has , '' I said . 
`` I ought to be more case-hardened after my Afghan experiences . 
I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve . '' 
`` I can understand . 
There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination ; where there is no imagination there is no horror . 
Have you seen the evening paper ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` It gives a fairly good account of the affair . 
It does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up , a woman 's wedding ring fell upon the floor . 
It is just as well it does not . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Look at this advertisement , '' he answered . 
`` I had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair . '' 
He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated . 
It was the first announcement in the `` Found '' column . 
`` In Brixton Road , this morning , '' it ran , `` a plain gold wedding ring , found in the roadway between the 'White Hart ' Tavern and Holland Grove . 
Apply Dr. Watson , 221B , Baker Street , between eight and nine this evening . '' 
`` Excuse my using your name , '' he said . 
`` If I used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it , and want to meddle in the affair . '' 
`` That is all right , '' I answered . 
`` But supposing anyone applies , I have no ring . '' 
`` Oh yes , you have , '' said he , handing me one . 
`` This will do very well . 
It is almost a facsimile . '' 
`` And who do you expect will answer this advertisement . '' 
`` Why , the man in the brown coat -- our florid friend with the square toes . 
If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice . '' 
`` Would he not consider it as too dangerous ? '' 
`` Not at all . 
If my view of the case is correct , and I have every reason to believe that it is , this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring . 
According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber's body , and did not miss it at the time . 
After leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back , but found the police already in possession , owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning . 
He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate . 
Now put yourself in that man 's place . 
On thinking the matter over , it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house . 
What would he do , then ? 
He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found . 
His eye , of course , would light upon this . 
He would be overjoyed . 
Why should he fear a trap ? 
There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder . 
He would come . 
He will come . 
You shall see him within an hour ? '' 
`` And then ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Oh , you can leave me to deal with him then . 
Have you any arms ? '' 
`` I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges . '' 
`` You had better clean it and load it . 
He will be a desperate man , and though I shall take him unawares , it is as well to be ready for anything . '' 
I went to my bedroom and followed his advice . 
When I returned with the pistol the table had been cleared , and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin . 
`` The plot thickens , '' he said , as I entered ; `` I have just had an answer to my American telegram . 
My view of the case is the correct one . '' 
`` And that is ? '' 
I asked eagerly . 
`` My fiddle would be the better for new strings , '' he remarked . 
`` Put your pistol in your pocket . 
When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way . 
Leave the rest to me . 
Do n't frighten him by looking at him too hard . '' 
`` It is eight o'clock now , '' I said , glancing at my watch . 
`` Yes . 
He will probably be here in a few minutes . 
Open the door slightly . 
That will do . 
Now put the key on the inside . 
Thank you ! 
This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday -- 'De Jure inter Gentes ' -- published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands , in 1642 . 
Charles' head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed volume was struck off . '' 
`` Who is the printer ? '' 
`` Philippe de Croy , whoever he may have been . 
On the fly-leaf , in very faded ink , is written 'Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte . ' 
I wonder who William Whyte was . 
Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer , I suppose . 
His writing has a legal twist about it . 
Here comes our man , I think . '' 
As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell . 
Sherlock Holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door . 
We heard the servant pass along the hall , and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it . 
`` Does Dr. Watson live here ? '' 
asked a clear but rather harsh voice . 
We could not hear the servant 's reply , but the door closed , and some one began to ascend the stairs . 
The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one . 
A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it . 
It came slowly along the passage , and there was a feeble tap at the door . 
`` Come in , '' I cried . 
At my summons , instead of the man of violence whom we expected , a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment . 
She appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light , and after dropping a curtsey , she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous , shaky fingers . 
I glanced at my companion , and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance . 
The old crone drew out an evening paper , and pointed at our advertisement . 
`` It 's this as has brought me , good gentlemen , '' she said , dropping another curtsey ; `` a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road . 
It belongs to my girl Sally , as was married only this time twelvemonth , which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat , and what he 'd say if he come 'ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think , he being short enough at the best o ' times , but more especially when he has the drink . 
If it please you , she went to the circus last night along with -- -- '' `` Is that her ring ? '' 
I asked . 
`` The Lord be thanked ! '' 
cried the old woman ; `` Sally will be a glad woman this night . 
That 's the ring . '' 
`` And what may your address be ? '' 
I inquired , taking up a pencil . 
`` 13 , Duncan Street , Houndsditch . 
A weary way from here . '' 
`` The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch , '' said Sherlock Holmes sharply . 
The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little red-rimmed eyes . 
`` The gentleman asked me for _my_ address , '' she said . 
`` Sally lives in lodgings at 3 , Mayfield Place , Peckham . '' 
`` And your name is -- -- ? '' 
`` My name is Sawyer -- her 's is Dennis , which Tom Dennis married her -- and a smart , clean lad , too , as long as he 's at sea , and no steward in the company more thought of ; but when on shore , what with the women and what with liquor shops -- -- '' `` Here is your ring , Mrs. Sawyer , '' I interrupted , in obedience to a sign from my companion ; `` it clearly belongs to your daughter , and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner . '' 
With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket , and shuffled off down the stairs . 
Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room . 
He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat . 
`` I 'll follow her , '' he said , hurriedly ; `` she must be an accomplice , and will lead me to him . 
Wait up for me . '' 
The hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair . 
Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side , while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind . 
`` Either his whole theory is incorrect , '' I thought to myself , `` or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery . '' 
There was no need for him to ask me to wait up for him , for I felt that sleep was impossible until I heard the result of his adventure . 
It was close upon nine when he set out . 
I had no idea how long he might be , but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of Henri Murger 's `` Vie de Boheme . '' 
Ten o'clock passed , and I heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed . 
Eleven , and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door , bound for the same destination . 
It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latch-key . 
The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful . 
Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery , until the former suddenly carried the day , and he burst into a hearty laugh . 
`` I would n't have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world , '' he cried , dropping into his chair ; `` I have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it . 
I can afford to laugh , because I know that I will be even with them in the long run . '' 
`` What is it then ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Oh , I do n't mind telling a story against myself . 
That creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being foot-sore . 
Presently she came to a halt , and hailed a four-wheeler which was passing . 
I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address , but I need not have been so anxious , for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street , 'Drive to 13 , Duncan Street , Houndsditch , ' she cried . 
This begins to look genuine , I thought , and having seen her safely inside , I perched myself behind . 
That 's an art which every detective should be an expert at . 
Well , away we rattled , and never drew rein until we reached the street in question . 
I hopped off before we came to the door , and strolled down the street in an easy , lounging way . 
I saw the cab pull up . 
The driver jumped down , and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly . 
Nothing came out though . 
When I reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab , and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to . 
There was no sign or trace of his passenger , and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare . 
On inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger , named Keswick , and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there . '' 
`` You do n't mean to say , '' I cried , in amazement , `` that that tottering , feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion , without either you or the driver seeing her ? '' 
`` Old woman be damned ! '' 
said Sherlock Holmes , sharply . 
`` We were the old women to be so taken in . 
It must have been a young man , and an active one , too , besides being an incomparable actor . 
The get-up was inimitable . 
He saw that he was followed , no doubt , and used this means of giving me the slip . 
It shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he was , but has friends who are ready to risk something for him . 
Now , Doctor , you are looking done-up . 
Take my advice and turn in . '' 
I was certainly feeling very weary , so I obeyed his injunction . 
I left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire , and long into the watches of the night I heard the low , melancholy wailings of his violin , and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel . 
. 
TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO . 
THE papers next day were full of the `` Brixton Mystery , '' as they termed it . 
Each had a long account of the affair , and some had leaders upon it in addition . 
There was some information in them which was new to me . 
I still retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case . 
Here is a condensation of a few of them : -- The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features . 
The German name of the victim , the absence of all other motive , and the sinister inscription on the wall , all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists . 
The Socialists had many branches in America , and the deceased had , no doubt , infringed their unwritten laws , and been tracked down by them . 
After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht , aqua tofana , Carbonari , the Marchioness de Brinvilliers , the Darwinian theory , the principles of Malthus , and the Ratcliff Highway murders , the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England . 
The _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration . 
They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses , and the consequent weakening of all authority . 
The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis . 
He had stayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier , in Torquay Terrace , Camberwell . 
He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary , Mr. Joseph Stangerson . 
The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday , the 4th inst. , and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express . 
They were afterwards seen together upon the platform . 
Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber 's body was , as recorded , discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road , many miles from Euston . 
How he came there , or how he met his fate , are questions which are still involved in mystery . 
Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson . 
We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson , of Scotland Yard , are both engaged upon the case , and it is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter . 
The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one . 
The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone . 
Among these men there was a stringent code of honour , any infringement of which was punished by death . 
Every effort should be made to find the secretary , Stangerson , and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased . 
A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded -- a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard . 
Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast , and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement . 
`` I told you that , whatever happened , Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score . '' 
`` That depends on how it turns out . '' 
`` Oh , bless you , it does n't matter in the least . 
If the man is caught , it will be _on account_ of their exertions ; if he escapes , it will be _in spite_ of their exertions . 
It 's heads I win and tails you lose . 
Whatever they do , they will have followers . 
'Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire . ' '' 
`` What on earth is this ? '' 
I cried , for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs , accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady . 
`` It 's the Baker Street division of the detective police force , '' said my companion , gravely ; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped eyes on . 
`` 'Tention ! '' 
cried Holmes , in a sharp tone , and the six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes . 
`` In future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report , and the rest of you must wait in the street . 
Have you found it , Wiggins ? '' 
`` No , sir , we hai n't , '' said one of the youths . 
`` I hardly expected you would . 
You must keep on until you do . 
Here are your wages . '' 
[ 13 ] He handed each of them a shilling . 
`` Now , off you go , and come back with a better report next time . '' 
He waved his hand , and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats , and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street . 
`` There 's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force , '' Holmes remarked . 
`` The mere sight of an official-looking person seals men 's lips . 
These youngsters , however , go everywhere and hear everything . 
They are as sharp as needles , too ; all they want is organisation . '' 
`` Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Yes ; there is a point which I wish to ascertain . 
It is merely a matter of time . 
Hullo ! 
we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance ! 
Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face . 
Bound for us , I know . 
Yes , he is stopping . 
There he is ! '' 
There was a violent peal at the bell , and in a few seconds the fair-haired detective came up the stairs , three steps at a time , and burst into our sitting-room . 
`` My dear fellow , '' he cried , wringing Holmes ' unresponsive hand , `` congratulate me ! 
I have made the whole thing as clear as day . '' 
A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion 's expressive face . 
`` Do you mean that you are on the right track ? '' 
he asked . 
`` The right track ! 
Why , sir , we have the man under lock and key . '' 
`` And his name is ? '' 
`` Arthur Charpentier , sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty 's navy , '' cried Gregson , pompously , rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest . 
Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief , and relaxed into a smile . 
`` Take a seat , and try one of these cigars , '' he said . 
`` We are anxious to know how you managed it . 
Will you have some whiskey and water ? '' 
`` I do n't mind if I do , '' the detective answered . 
`` The tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out . 
Not so much bodily exertion , you understand , as the strain upon the mind . 
You will appreciate that , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , for we are both brain-workers . '' 
`` You do me too much honour , '' said Holmes , gravely . 
`` Let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result . '' 
The detective seated himself in the arm-chair , and puffed complacently at his cigar . 
Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement . 
`` The fun of it is , '' he cried , `` that that fool Lestrade , who thinks himself so smart , has gone off upon the wrong track altogether . 
He is after the secretary Stangerson , who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn . 
I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time . '' 
The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked . 
`` And how did you get your clue ? '' 
`` Ah , I 'll tell you all about it . 
Of course , Doctor Watson , this is strictly between ourselves . 
The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American 's antecedents . 
Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered , or until parties came forward and volunteered information . 
That is not Tobias Gregson's way of going to work . 
You remember the hat beside the dead man ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Holmes ; `` by John Underwood and Sons , 129 , Camberwell Road . '' 
Gregson looked quite crest-fallen . 
`` I had no idea that you noticed that , '' he said . 
`` Have you been there ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Ha ! '' 
cried Gregson , in a relieved voice ; `` you should never neglect a chance , however small it may seem . '' 
`` To a great mind , nothing is little , '' remarked Holmes , sententiously . 
`` Well , I went to Underwood , and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description . 
He looked over his books , and came on it at once . 
He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber , residing at Charpentier 's Boarding Establishment , Torquay Terrace . 
Thus I got at his address . '' 
`` Smart -- very smart ! '' 
murmured Sherlock Holmes . 
`` I next called upon Madame Charpentier , '' continued the detective . 
`` I found her very pale and distressed . 
Her daughter was in the room , too -- an uncommonly fine girl she is , too ; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her . 
That did n't escape my notice . 
I began to smell a rat . 
You know the feeling , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , when you come upon the right scent -- a kind of thrill in your nerves . 
'Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber , of Cleveland ? ' 
I asked . 
`` The mother nodded . 
She did n't seem able to get out a word . 
The daughter burst into tears . 
I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter . 
`` 'At what o'clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train ? ' 
I asked . 
`` 'At eight o'clock , ' she said , gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation . 
'His secretary , Mr. Stangerson , said that there were two trains -- one at 9.15 and one at 11 . 
He was to catch the first . 
[ 14 ] `` 'And was that the last which you saw of him ? ' 
`` A terrible change came over the woman 's face as I asked the question . 
Her features turned perfectly livid . 
It was some seconds before she could get out the single word 'Yes ' -- and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone . 
`` There was silence for a moment , and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice . 
`` 'No good can ever come of falsehood , mother , ' she said . 
'Let us be frank with this gentleman . 
We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again . ' 
`` 'God forgive you ! ' 
cried Madame Charpentier , throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair . 
'You have murdered your brother . ' 
`` 'Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth , ' the girl answered firmly . 
`` 'You had best tell me all about it now , ' I said . 
'Half-confidences are worse than none . 
Besides , you do not know how much we know of it . ' 
`` 'On your head be it , Alice ! ' 
cried her mother ; and then , turning to me , ' I will tell you all , sir . 
Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair . 
He is utterly innocent of it . 
My dread is , however , that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised . 
That however is surely impossible . 
His high character , his profession , his antecedents would all forbid it . ' 
`` 'Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts , ' I answered . 
'Depend upon it , if your son is innocent he will be none the worse . ' 
`` 'Perhaps , Alice , you had better leave us together , ' she said , and her daughter withdrew . 
'Now , sir , ' she continued , ' I had no intention of telling you all this , but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative . 
Having once decided to speak , I will tell you all without omitting any particular . ' 
`` 'It is your wisest course , ' said I . 
`` 'Mr . 
Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks . 
He and his secretary , Mr. Stangerson , had been travelling on the Continent . 
I noticed a `` Copenhagen '' label upon each of their trunks , showing that that had been their last stopping place . 
Stangerson was a quiet reserved man , but his employer , I am sorry to say , was far otherwise . 
He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways . 
The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink , and , indeed , after twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober . 
His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar . 
Worst of all , he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter , Alice , and spoke to her more than once in a way which , fortunately , she is too innocent to understand . 
On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her -- an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct . ' 
`` 'But why did you stand all this , ' I asked . 
' I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish . ' 
`` Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question . 
'Would to God that I had given him notice on the very day that he came , ' she said . 
'But it was a sore temptation . 
They were paying a pound a day each -- fourteen pounds a week , and this is the slack season . 
I am a widow , and my boy in the Navy has cost me much . 
I grudged to lose the money . 
I acted for the best . 
This last was too much , however , and I gave him notice to leave on account of it . 
That was the reason of his going . ' 
`` 'Well ? ' 
`` 'My heart grew light when I saw him drive away . 
My son is on leave just now , but I did not tell him anything of all this , for his temper is violent , and he is passionately fond of his sister . 
When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind . 
Alas , in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell , and I learned that Mr. Drebber had returned . 
He was much excited , and evidently the worse for drink . 
He forced his way into the room , where I was sitting with my daughter , and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train . 
He then turned to Alice , and before my very face , proposed to her that she should fly with him . 
`` You are of age , '' he said , `` and there is no law to stop you . 
I have money enough and to spare . 
Never mind the old girl here , but come along with me now straight away . 
You shall live like a princess . '' 
Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him , but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door . 
I screamed , and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room . 
What happened then I do not know . 
I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle . 
I was too terrified to raise my head . 
When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing , with a stick in his hand . 
`` I do n't think that fine fellow will trouble us again , '' he said . 
`` I will just go after him and see what he does with himself . '' 
With those words he took his hat and started off down the street . 
The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber 's mysterious death . ' 
`` This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier 's lips with many gasps and pauses . 
At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words . 
I made shorthand notes of all that she said , however , so that there should be no possibility of a mistake . '' 
`` It 's quite exciting , '' said Sherlock Holmes , with a yawn . 
`` What happened next ? '' 
`` When Mrs. Charpentier paused , '' the detective continued , `` I saw that the whole case hung upon one point . 
Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women , I asked her at what hour her son returned . 
`` ' I do not know , ' she answered . 
`` 'Not know ? ' 
`` 'No ; he has a latch-key , and he let himself in . ' 
`` 'After you went to bed ? ' 
`` 'Yes . ' 
`` 'When did you go to bed ? ' 
`` 'About eleven . ' 
`` 'So your son was gone at least two hours ? ' 
`` 'Yes . ' 
`` 'Possibly four or five ? ' 
`` 'Yes . ' 
`` 'What was he doing during that time ? ' 
`` ' I do not know , ' she answered , turning white to her very lips . 
`` Of course after that there was nothing more to be done . 
I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was , took two officers with me , and arrested him . 
When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us , he answered us as bold as brass , ' I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber , ' he said . 
We had said nothing to him about it , so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect . '' 
`` Very , '' said Holmes . 
`` He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed Drebber . 
It was a stout oak cudgel . '' 
`` What is your theory , then ? '' 
`` Well , my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road . 
When there , a fresh altercation arose between them , in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick , in the pit of the stomach , perhaps , which killed him without leaving any mark . 
The night was so wet that no one was about , so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house . 
As to the candle , and the blood , and the writing on the wall , and the ring , they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent . '' 
`` Well done ! '' 
said Holmes in an encouraging voice . 
`` Really , Gregson , you are getting along . 
We shall make something of you yet . '' 
`` I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly , '' the detective answered proudly . 
`` The young man volunteered a statement , in which he said that after following Drebber some time , the latter perceived him , and took a cab in order to get away from him . 
On his way home he met an old shipmate , and took a long walk with him . 
On being asked where this old shipmate lived , he was unable to give any satisfactory reply . 
I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well . 
What amuses me is to think of Lestrade , who had started off upon the wrong scent . 
I am afraid he wo n't make much of [ 15 ] Why , by Jove , here 's the very man himself ! '' 
It was indeed Lestrade , who had ascended the stairs while we were talking , and who now entered the room . 
The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were , however , wanting . 
His face was disturbed and troubled , while his clothes were disarranged and untidy . 
He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes , for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out . 
He stood in the centre of the room , fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do . 
`` This is a most extraordinary case , '' he said at last -- '' a most incomprehensible affair . '' 
`` Ah , you find it so , Mr . 
Lestrade ! '' 
cried Gregson , triumphantly . 
`` I thought you would come to that conclusion . 
Have you managed to find the Secretary , Mr. Joseph Stangerson ? '' 
`` The Secretary , Mr. Joseph Stangerson , '' said Lestrade gravely , `` was murdered at Halliday 's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning . '' 
. 
LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS . 
THE intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected , that we were all three fairly dumfoundered . 
Gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water . 
I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes , whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes . 
`` Stangerson too ! '' 
he muttered . 
`` The plot thickens . '' 
`` It was quite thick enough before , '' grumbled Lestrade , taking a chair . 
`` I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war . '' 
`` Are you -- are you sure of this piece of intelligence ? '' 
stammered Gregson . 
`` I have just come from his room , '' said Lestrade . 
`` I was the first to discover what had occurred . '' 
`` We have been hearing Gregson 's view of the matter , '' Holmes observed . 
`` Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done ? '' 
`` I have no objection , '' Lestrade answered , seating himself . 
`` I freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber . 
This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken . 
Full of the one idea , I set myself to find out what had become of the Secretary . 
They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third . 
At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road . 
The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime , and what had become of him afterwards . 
I telegraphed to Liverpool , giving a description of the man , and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats . 
I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston . 
You see , I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated , the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night , and then to hang about the station again next morning . '' 
`` They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand , '' remarked Holmes . 
`` So it proved . 
I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail . 
This morning I began very early , and at eight o'clock I reached Halliday 's Private Hotel , in Little George Street . 
On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there , they at once answered me in the affirmative . 
`` 'No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting , ' they said . 
'He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days . ' 
`` 'Where is he now ? ' 
I asked . 
`` 'He is upstairs in bed . 
He wished to be called at nine . ' 
`` ' I will go up and see him at once , ' I said . 
`` It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded . 
The Boots volunteered to show me the room : it was on the second floor , and there was a small corridor leading up to it . 
The Boots pointed out the door to me , and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish , in spite of my twenty years ' experience . 
From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood , which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side . 
I gave a cry , which brought the Boots back . 
He nearly fainted when he saw it . 
The door was locked on the inside , but we put our shoulders to it , and knocked it in . 
The window of the room was open , and beside the window , all huddled up , lay the body of a man in his nightdress . 
He was quite dead , and had been for some time , for his limbs were rigid and cold . 
When we turned him over , the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson . 
The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side , which must have penetrated the heart . 
And now comes the strangest part of the affair . 
What do you suppose was above the murdered man ? '' 
I felt a creeping of the flesh , and a presentiment of coming horror , even before Sherlock Holmes answered . 
`` The word RACHE , written in letters of blood , '' he said . 
`` That was it , '' said Lestrade , in an awe-struck voice ; and we were all silent for a while . 
There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin , that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes . 
My nerves , which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought of it . 
`` The man was seen , '' continued Lestrade . 
`` A milk boy , passing on his way to the dairy , happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel . 
He noticed that a ladder , which usually lay there , was raised against one of the windows of the second floor , which was wide open . 
After passing , he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder . 
He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel . 
He took no particular notice of him , beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work . 
He has an impression that the man was tall , had a reddish face , and was dressed in a long , brownish coat . 
He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder , for we found blood-stained water in the basin , where he had washed his hands , and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife . '' 
I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer , which tallied so exactly with his own . 
There was , however , no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face . 
`` Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Nothing . 
Stangerson had Drebber 's purse in his pocket , but it seems that this was usual , as he did all the paying . 
There was eighty odd pounds in it , but nothing had been taken . 
Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes , robbery is certainly not one of them . 
There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man 's pocket , except a single telegram , dated from Cleveland about a month ago , and containing the words , ' J . 
H. is in Europe . ' 
There was no name appended to this message . '' 
`` And there was nothing else ? '' 
Holmes asked . 
`` Nothing of any importance . 
The man 's novel , with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed , and his pipe was on a chair beside him . 
There was a glass of water on the table , and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills . '' 
Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight . 
`` The last link , '' he cried , exultantly . 
`` My case is complete . '' 
The two detectives stared at him in amazement . 
`` I have now in my hands , '' my companion said , confidently , `` all the threads which have formed such a tangle . 
There are , of course , details to be filled in , but I am as certain of all the main facts , from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station , up to the discovery of the body of the latter , as if I had seen them with my own eyes . 
I will give you a proof of my knowledge . 
Could you lay your hand upon those pills ? '' 
`` I have them , '' said Lestrade , producing a small white box ; `` I took them and the purse and the telegram , intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station . 
It was the merest chance my taking these pills , for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to them . '' 
`` Give them here , '' said Holmes . 
`` Now , Doctor , '' turning to me , `` are those ordinary pills ? '' 
They certainly were not . 
They were of a pearly grey colour , small , round , and almost transparent against the light . 
`` From their lightness and transparency , I should imagine that they are soluble in water , '' I remarked . 
`` Precisely so , '' answered Holmes . 
`` Now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long , and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday . '' 
I went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms . 
It 's laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end . 
Indeed , its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence . 
I placed it upon a cushion on the rug . 
`` I will now cut one of these pills in two , '' said Holmes , and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word . 
`` One half we return into the box for future purposes . 
The other half I will place in this wine glass , in which is a teaspoonful of water . 
You perceive that our friend , the Doctor , is right , and that it readily dissolves . '' 
`` This may be very interesting , '' said Lestrade , in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at , `` I can not see , however , what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson . '' 
`` Patience , my friend , patience ! 
You will find in time that it has everything to do with it . 
I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable , and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough . '' 
As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier , who speedily licked it dry . 
Sherlock Holmes ' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence , watching the animal intently , and expecting some startling effect . 
None such appeared , however . 
The dog continued to lie stretched upon tho [ 16 ] cushion , breathing in a laboured way , but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught . 
Holmes had taken out his watch , and as minute followed minute without result , an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features . 
He gnawed his lip , drummed his fingers upon the table , and showed every other symptom of acute impatience . 
So great was his emotion , that I felt sincerely sorry for him , while the two detectives smiled derisively , by no means displeased at this check which he had met . 
`` It ca n't be a coincidence , '' he cried , at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room ; `` it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence . 
The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson . 
And yet they are inert . 
What can it mean ? 
Surely my whole chain of reasoning can not have been false . 
It is impossible ! 
And yet this wretched dog is none the worse . 
Ah , I have it ! 
I have it ! '' 
With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box , cut the other pill in two , dissolved it , added milk , and presented it to the terrier . 
The unfortunate creature 's tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb , and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning . 
Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath , and wiped the perspiration from his forehead . 
`` I should have more faith , '' he said ; `` I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions , it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation . 
Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison , and the other was entirely harmless . 
I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all . '' 
This last statement appeared to me to be so startling , that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses . 
There was the dead dog , however , to prove that his conjecture had been correct . 
It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away , and I began to have a dim , vague perception of the truth . 
`` All this seems strange to you , '' continued Holmes , `` because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you . 
I had the good fortune to seize upon that , and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition , and , indeed , was the logical sequence of it . 
Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure , have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions . 
It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery . 
The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn . 
This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _outre_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable . 
These strange details , far from making the case more difficult , have really had the effect of making it less so . '' 
Mr. Gregson , who had listened to this address with considerable impatience , could contain himself no longer . 
`` Look here , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , '' he said , `` we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man , and that you have your own methods of working . 
We want something more than mere theory and preaching now , though . 
It is a case of taking the man . 
I have made my case out , and it seems I was wrong . 
Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair . 
Lestrade went after his man , Stangerson , and it appears that he was wrong too . 
You have thrown out hints here , and hints there , and seem to know more than we do , but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business . 
Can you name the man who did it ? '' 
`` I can not help feeling that Gregson is right , sir , '' remarked Lestrade . 
`` We have both tried , and we have both failed . 
You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require . 
Surely you will not withhold it any longer . '' 
`` Any delay in arresting the assassin , '' I observed , `` might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity . '' 
Thus pressed by us all , Holmes showed signs of irresolution . 
He continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down , as was his habit when lost in thought . 
`` There will be no more murders , '' he said at last , stopping abruptly and facing us . 
`` You can put that consideration out of the question . 
You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin . 
I do . 
The mere knowing of his name is a small thing , however , compared with the power of laying our hands upon him . 
This I expect very shortly to do . 
I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements ; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling , for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with , who is supported , as I have had occasion to prove , by another who is as clever as himself . 
As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him ; but if he had the slightest suspicion , he would change his name , and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city . 
Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings , I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force , and that is why I have not asked your assistance . 
If I fail I shall , of course , incur all the blame due to this omission ; but that I am prepared for . 
At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations , I shall do so . '' 
Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance , or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police . 
The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair , while the other 's beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment . 
Neither of them had time to speak , however , before there was a tap at the door , and the spokesman of the street Arabs , young Wiggins , introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person . 
`` Please , sir , '' he said , touching his forelock , `` I have the cab downstairs . '' 
`` Good boy , '' said Holmes , blandly . 
`` Why do n't you introduce this pattern at Scotland Yard ? '' 
he continued , taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer . 
`` See how beautifully the spring works . 
They fasten in an instant . '' 
`` The old pattern is good enough , '' remarked Lestrade , `` if we can only find the man to put them on . '' 
`` Very good , very good , '' said Holmes , smiling . 
`` The cabman may as well help me with my boxes . 
Just ask him to step up , Wiggins . '' 
I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey , since he had not said anything to me about it . 
There was a small portmanteau in the room , and this he pulled out and began to strap . 
He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room . 
`` Just give me a help with this buckle , cabman , '' he said , kneeling over his task , and never turning his head . 
The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen , defiant air , and put down his hands to assist . 
At that instant there was a sharp click , the jangling of metal , and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again . 
`` Gentlemen , '' he cried , with flashing eyes , `` let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope , the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson . '' 
The whole thing occurred in a moment -- so quickly that I had no time to realize it . 
I have a vivid recollection of that instant , of Holmes' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice , of the cabman's dazed , savage face , as he glared at the glittering handcuffs , which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists . 
For a second or two we might have been a group of statues . 
Then , with an inarticulate roar of fury , the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes 's grasp , and hurled himself through the window . 
Woodwork and glass gave way before him ; but before he got quite through , Gregson , Lestrade , and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds . 
He was dragged back into the room , and then commenced a terrific conflict . 
So powerful and so fierce was he , that the four of us were shaken off again and again . 
He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit . 
His face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass , but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance . 
It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail ; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands . 
That done , we rose to our feet breathless and panting . 
`` We have his cab , '' said Sherlock Holmes . 
`` It will serve to take him to Scotland Yard . 
And now , gentlemen , '' he continued , with a pleasant smile , `` we have reached the end of our little mystery . 
You are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now , and there is no danger that I will refuse to answer them . '' 
PART II . 
_The Country of the Saints._ . 
ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN . 
IN the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert , which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation . 
From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska , and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south , is a region of desolation and silence . 
Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district . 
It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains , and dark and gloomy valleys . 
There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged canons ; and there are enormous plains , which in winter are white with snow , and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust . 
They all preserve , however , the common characteristics of barrenness , inhospitality , and misery . 
There are no inhabitants of this land of despair . 
A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-grounds , but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains , and to find themselves once more upon their prairies . 
The coyote skulks among the scrub , the buzzard flaps heavily through the air , and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines , and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks . 
These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness . 
In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco . 
As far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain-land , all dusted over with patches of alkali , and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes . 
On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks , with their rugged summits flecked with snow . 
In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life , nor of anything appertaining to life . 
There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven , no movement upon the dull , grey earth -- above all , there is absolute silence . 
Listen as one may , there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness ; nothing but silence -- complete and heart-subduing silence . 
It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain . 
That is hardly true . 
Looking down from the Sierra Blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance . 
It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers . 
Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali . 
Approach , and examine them ! 
They are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate . 
The former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men . 
For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside . 
Looking down on this very scene , there stood upon the fourth of May , eighteen hundred and forty-seven , a solitary traveller . 
His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region . 
An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty . 
His face was lean and haggard , and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones ; his long , brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white ; his eyes were sunken in his head , and burned with an unnatural lustre ; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton . 
As he stood , he leaned upon his weapon for support , and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution . 
His gaunt face , however , and his clothes , which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs , proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance . 
The man was dying -- dying from hunger and from thirst . 
He had toiled painfully down the ravine , and on to this little elevation , in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water . 
Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes , and the distant belt of savage mountains , without a sign anywhere of plant or tree , which might indicate the presence of moisture . 
In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope . 
North , and east , and west he looked with wild questioning eyes , and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end , and that there , on that barren crag , he was about to die . 
`` Why not here , as well as in a feather bed , twenty years hence , '' he muttered , as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder . 
Before sitting down , he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle , and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl , which he had carried slung over his right shoulder . 
It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength , for in lowering it , it came down on the ground with some little violence . 
Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry , and from it there protruded a small , scared face , with very bright brown eyes , and two little speckled , dimpled fists . 
`` You 've hurt me ! '' 
said a childish voice reproachfully . 
`` Have I though , '' the man answered penitently , `` I did n't go for to do it . '' 
As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age , whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother 's care . 
The child was pale and wan , but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion . 
`` How is it now ? '' 
he answered anxiously , for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head . 
`` Kiss it and make it well , '' she said , with perfect gravity , shoving [ 19 ] the injured part up to him . 
`` That 's what mother used to do . 
Where's mother ? '' 
`` Mother 's gone . 
I guess you 'll see her before long . '' 
`` Gone , eh ! '' 
said the little girl . 
`` Funny , she did n't say good-bye ; she 'most always did if she was just goin ' over to Auntie 's for tea , and now she 's been away three days . 
Say , it 's awful dry , ai n't it ? 
Ai n't there no water , nor nothing to eat ? '' 
`` No , there ai n't nothing , dearie . 
You 'll just need to be patient awhile , and then you 'll be all right . 
Put your head up agin me like that , and then you 'll feel bullier . 
It ai n't easy to talk when your lips is like leather , but I guess I 'd best let you know how the cards lie . 
What's that you 've got ? '' 
`` Pretty things ! 
fine things ! '' 
cried the little girl enthusiastically , holding up two glittering fragments of mica . 
`` When we goes back to home I 'll give them to brother Bob . '' 
`` You 'll see prettier things than them soon , '' said the man confidently . 
`` You just wait a bit . 
I was going to tell you though -- you remember when we left the river ? '' 
`` Oh , yes . '' 
`` Well , we reckoned we 'd strike another river soon , d 'ye see . 
But there was somethin ' wrong ; compasses , or map , or somethin ' , and it didn't turn up . 
Water ran out . 
Just except a little drop for the likes of you and -- and -- -- '' `` And you could n't wash yourself , '' interrupted his companion gravely , staring up at his grimy visage . 
`` No , nor drink . 
And Mr. Bender , he was the fust to go , and then Indian Pete , and then Mrs. McGregor , and then Johnny Hones , and then , dearie , your mother . '' 
`` Then mother 's a deader too , '' cried the little girl dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly . 
`` Yes , they all went except you and me . 
Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction , so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together . 
It do n't seem as though we 've improved matters . 
There 's an almighty small chance for us now ! '' 
`` Do you mean that we are going to die too ? '' 
asked the child , checking her sobs , and raising her tear-stained face . 
`` I guess that 's about the size of it . '' 
`` Why did n't you say so before ? '' 
she said , laughing gleefully . 
`` You gave me such a fright . 
Why , of course , now as long as we die we 'll be with mother again . '' 
`` Yes , you will , dearie . '' 
`` And you too . 
I 'll tell her how awful good you 've been . 
I 'll bet she meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water , and a lot of buckwheat cakes , hot , and toasted on both sides , like Bob and me was fond of . 
How long will it be first ? '' 
`` I do n't know -- not very long . '' 
The man 's eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon . 
In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment , so rapidly did they approach . 
They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds , which circled over the heads of the two wanderers , and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them . 
They were buzzards , the vultures of the west , whose coming is the forerunner of death . 
`` Cocks and hens , '' cried the little girl gleefully , pointing at their ill-omened forms , and clapping her hands to make them rise . 
`` Say , did God make this country ? '' 
`` In course He did , '' said her companion , rather startled by this unexpected question . 
`` He made the country down in Illinois , and He made the Missouri , '' the little girl continued . 
`` I guess somebody else made the country in these parts . 
It 's not nearly so well done . 
They forgot the water and the trees . '' 
`` What would ye think of offering up prayer ? '' 
the man asked diffidently . 
`` It ai n't night yet , '' she answered . 
`` It do n't matter . 
It ai n't quite regular , but He wo n't mind that , you bet . 
You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the Plains . '' 
`` Why do n't you say some yourself ? '' 
the child asked , with wondering eyes . 
`` I disremember them , '' he answered . 
`` I hai n't said none since I was half the height o ' that gun . 
I guess it 's never too late . 
You say them out , and I 'll stand by and come in on the choruses . '' 
`` Then you 'll need to kneel down , and me too , '' she said , laying the shawl out for that purpose . 
`` You 've got to put your hands up like this . 
It makes you feel kind o ' good . '' 
It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it . 
Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers , the little prattling child and the reckless , hardened adventurer . 
Her chubby face , and his haggard , angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face , while the two voices -- the one thin and clear , the other deep and harsh -- united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness . 
The prayer finished , they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep , nestling upon the broad breast of her protector . 
He watched over her slumber for some time , but Nature proved to be too strong for him . 
For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose . 
Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes , and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast , until the man 's grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion , and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber . 
Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes . 
Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust , very slight at first , and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance , but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid , well-defined cloud . 
This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures . 
In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him . 
This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds . 
As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing , the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze , and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West . 
But what a caravan ! 
When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains , the rear was not yet visible on the horizon . 
Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array , waggons and carts , men on horseback , and men on foot . 
Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens , and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings . 
This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants , but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country . 
There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity , with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses . 
Loud as it was , it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them . 
At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men , clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles . 
On reaching the base of the bluff they halted , and held a short council among themselves . 
`` The wells are to the right , my brothers , '' said one , a hard-lipped , clean-shaven man with grizzly hair . 
`` To the right of the Sierra Blanco -- so we shall reach the Rio Grande , '' said another . 
`` Fear not for water , '' cried a third . 
`` He who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people . '' 
`` Amen ! 
Amen ! '' 
responded the whole party . 
They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them . 
From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink , showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind . 
At the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns , while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard . 
The word 'Redskins ' was on every lip . 
`` There ca n't be any number of Injuns here , '' said the elderly man who appeared to be in command . 
`` We have passed the Pawnees , and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains . '' 
`` Shall I go forward and see , Brother Stangerson , '' asked one of the band . 
`` And I , '' `` and I , '' cried a dozen voices . 
`` Leave your horses below and we will await you here , '' the Elder answered . 
In a moment the young fellows had dismounted , fastened their horses , and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity . 
They advanced rapidly and noiselessly , with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts . 
The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline . 
The young man who had first given the alarm was leading them . 
Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands , as though overcome with astonishment , and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes . 
On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder , and against this boulder there lay a tall man , long-bearded and hard-featured , but of an excessive thinness . 
His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep . 
Beside him lay a little child , with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck , and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic . 
Her rosy lips were parted , showing the regular line of snow-white teeth within , and a playful smile played over her infantile features . 
Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles , offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion . 
On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards , who , at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away . 
The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about [ 20 ] them in bewilderment . 
The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him , and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts . 
His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed , and he passed his boney hand over his eyes . 
`` This is what they call delirium , I guess , '' he muttered . 
The child stood beside him , holding on to the skirt of his coat , and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood . 
The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion . 
One of them seized the little girl , and hoisted her upon his shoulder , while two others supported her gaunt companion , and assisted him towards the waggons . 
`` My name is John Ferrier , '' the wanderer explained ; `` me and that little un are all that 's left o ' twenty-one people . 
The rest is all dead o' thirst and hunger away down in the south . '' 
`` Is she your child ? '' 
asked someone . 
`` I guess she is now , '' the other cried , defiantly ; `` she 's mine 'cause I saved her . 
No man will take her from me . 
She 's Lucy Ferrier from this day on . 
Who are you , though ? '' 
he continued , glancing with curiosity at his stalwart , sunburned rescuers ; `` there seems to be a powerful lot of ye . '' 
`` Nigh upon ten thousand , '' said one of the young men ; `` we are the persecuted children of God -- the chosen of the Angel Merona . '' 
`` I never heard tell on him , '' said the wanderer . 
`` He appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye . '' 
`` Do not jest at that which is sacred , '' said the other sternly . 
`` We are of those who believe in those sacred writings , drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold , which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at Palmyra . 
We have come from Nauvoo , in the State of Illinois , where we had founded our temple . 
We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless , even though it be the heart of the desert . '' 
The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier . 
`` I see , '' he said , `` you are the Mormons . '' 
`` We are the Mormons , '' answered his companions with one voice . 
`` And where are you going ? '' 
`` We do not know . 
The hand of God is leading us under the person of our Prophet . 
You must come before him . 
He shall say what is to be done with you . '' 
They had reached the base of the hill by this time , and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims -- pale-faced meek-looking women , strong laughing children , and anxious earnest-eyed men . 
Many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other . 
Their escort did not halt , however , but pushed on , followed by a great crowd of Mormons , until they reached a waggon , which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance . 
Six horses were yoked to it , whereas the others were furnished with two , or , at most , four a-piece . 
Beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age , but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader . 
He was reading a brown-backed volume , but as the crowd approached he laid it aside , and listened attentively to an account of the episode . 
Then he turned to the two castaways . 
`` If we take you with us , '' he said , in solemn words , `` it can only be as believers in our own creed . 
We shall have no wolves in our fold . 
Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit . 
Will you come with us on these terms ? '' 
`` Guess I 'll come with you on any terms , '' said Ferrier , with such emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile . 
The leader alone retained his stern , impressive expression . 
`` Take him , Brother Stangerson , '' he said , `` give him food and drink , and the child likewise . 
Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed . 
We have delayed long enough . 
Forward ! 
On , on to Zion ! '' 
`` On , on to Zion ! '' 
cried the crowd of Mormons , and the words rippled down the long caravan , passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance . 
With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion , and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more . 
The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed , led them to his waggon , where a meal was already awaiting them . 
`` You shall remain here , '' he said . 
`` In a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues . 
In the meantime , remember that now and for ever you are of our religion . 
Brigham Young has said it , and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith , which is the voice of God . '' 
. 
THE FLOWER OF UTAH . 
THIS is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven . 
From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history . 
The savage man , and the savage beast , hunger , thirst , fatigue , and disease -- every impediment which Nature could place in the way , had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity . 
Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them . 
There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them , and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land , and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore . 
Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief . 
Maps were drawn and charts prepared , in which the future city was sketched out . 
All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual . 
The tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling . 
In the town streets and squares sprang up , as if by magic . 
In the country there was draining and hedging , planting and clearing , until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop . 
Everything prospered in the strange settlement . 
Above all , the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger . 
From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight , the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers . 
The two castaways , John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter , accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage . 
Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson 's waggon , a retreat which she shared with the Mormon 's three wives and with his son , a headstrong forward boy of twelve . 
Having rallied , with the elasticity of childhood , from the shock caused by her mother 's death , she soon became a pet with the women , and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered home . 
In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations , distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter . 
So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions , that when they reached the end of their wanderings , it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers , with the exception of Young himself , and of Stangerson , Kemball , Johnston , and Drebber , who were the four principal Elders . 
On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house , which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa . 
He was a man of a practical turn of mind , keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands . 
His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands . 
Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly . 
In three years he was better off than his neighbours , in six he was well-to-do , in nine he was rich , and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him . 
From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier . 
There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his co-religionists . 
No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions . 
He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal , but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination . 
There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion , and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense . 
Others , again , spoke of some early love affair , and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic . 
Whatever the reason , Ferrier remained strictly celibate . 
In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement , and gained the name of being an orthodox and straight-walking man . 
Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house , and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings . 
The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl . 
As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger , her cheek more rudy , and her step more elastic . 
Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier 's farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields , or met her mounted upon her father 's mustang , and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West . 
So the bud blossomed into a flower , and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope . 
It was not the father , however , who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman . 
It seldom is in such cases . 
That mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates . 
Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her , and she learns , with a mixture of pride and of fear , that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her . 
There are few who can not recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life . 
In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself , apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides . 
It was a warm June morning , and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem . 
In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry . 
Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules , all heading to the west , for the gold fever had broken out in California , and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect . 
There , too , were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands , and trains of tired immigrants , men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey . 
Through all this motley assemblage , threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider , there galloped Lucy Ferrier , her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her . 
She had a commission from her father in the City , and was dashing in as she had done many a time before , with all the fearlessness of youth , thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed . 
The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment , and even the unemotional Indians , journeying in with their pelties , relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden . 
She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle , driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains . 
In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap . 
Scarcely had she got fairly into it , however , before the beasts closed in behind her , and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed , long-horned bullocks . 
Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle , she was not alarmed at her situation , but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade . 
Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures , either by accident or design , came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang , and excited it to madness . 
In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage , and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider . 
The situation was full of peril . 
Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again , and goaded it to fresh madness . 
It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle , yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals . 
Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies , her head began to swim , and her grip upon the bridle to relax . 
Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures , she might have abandoned her efforts in despair , but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance . 
At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb , and forcing a way through the drove , soon brought her to the outskirts . 
`` You 're not hurt , I hope , miss , '' said her preserver , respectfully . 
She looked up at his dark , fierce face , and laughed saucily . 
`` I 'm awful frightened , '' she said , naively ; `` whoever would have thought that Poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows ? '' 
`` Thank God you kept your seat , '' the other said earnestly . 
He was a tall , savage-looking young fellow , mounted on a powerful roan horse , and clad in the rough dress of a hunter , with a long rifle slung over his shoulders . 
`` I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier , '' he remarked , `` I saw you ride down from his house . 
When you see him , ask him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis . 
If he 's the same Ferrier , my father and he were pretty thick . '' 
`` Had n't you better come and ask yourself ? '' 
she asked , demurely . 
The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion , and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure . 
`` I 'll do so , '' he said , `` we 've been in the mountains for two months , and are not over and above in visiting condition . 
He must take us as he finds us . '' 
`` He has a good deal to thank you for , and so have I , '' she answered , `` he 's awful fond of me . 
If those cows had jumped on me he 'd have never got over it . '' 
`` Neither would I , '' said her companion . 
`` You ! 
Well , I do n't see that it would make much matter to you , anyhow . 
You ai n't even a friend of ours . '' 
The young hunter 's dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud . 
`` There , I did n't mean that , '' she said ; `` of course , you are a friend now . 
You must come and see us . 
Now I must push along , or father wo n't trust me with his business any more . 
Good-bye ! '' 
`` Good-bye , '' he answered , raising his broad sombrero , and bending over her little hand . 
She wheeled her mustang round , gave it a cut with her riding-whip , and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust . 
Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions , gloomy and taciturn . 
He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver , and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered . 
He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel . 
The sight of the fair young girl , as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes , had stirred his volcanic , untamed heart to its very depths . 
When she had vanished from his sight , he realized that a crisis had come in his life , and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one . 
The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden , changeable fancy of a boy , but rather the wild , fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper . 
He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook . 
He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful . 
He called on John Ferrier that night , and many times again , until his face was a familiar one at the farm-house . 
John , cooped up in the valley , and absorbed in his work , had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years . 
All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him , and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father . 
He had been a pioneer in California , and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild , halcyon days . 
He had been a scout too , and a trapper , a silver explorer , and a ranchman . 
Wherever stirring adventures were to be had , Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them . 
He soon became a favourite with the old farmer , who spoke eloquently of his virtues . 
On such occasions , Lucy was silent , but her blushing cheek and her bright , happy eyes , showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own . 
Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms , but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections . 
It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate . 
She was at the doorway , and came down to meet him . 
He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway . 
`` I am off , Lucy , '' he said , taking her two hands in his , and gazing tenderly down into her face ; `` I wo n't ask you to come with me now , but will you be ready to come when I am here again ? '' 
`` And when will that be ? '' 
she asked , blushing and laughing . 
`` A couple of months at the outside . 
I will come and claim you then , my darling . 
There 's no one who can stand between us . '' 
`` And how about father ? '' 
she asked . 
`` He has given his consent , provided we get these mines working all right . 
I have no fear on that head . '' 
`` Oh , well ; of course , if you and father have arranged it all , there's no more to be said , '' she whispered , with her cheek against his broad breast . 
`` Thank God ! '' 
he said , hoarsely , stooping and kissing her . 
`` It is settled , then . 
The longer I stay , the harder it will be to go . 
They are waiting for me at the canon . 
Good-bye , my own darling -- good-bye . 
In two months you shall see me . '' 
He tore himself from her as he spoke , and , flinging himself upon his horse , galloped furiously away , never even looking round , as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving . 
She stood at the gate , gazing after him until he vanished from her sight . 
Then she walked back into the house , the happiest girl in all Utah . 
. 
JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET . 
THREE weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had departed from Salt Lake City . 
John Ferrier 's heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man 's return , and of the impending loss of his adopted child . 
Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done . 
He had always determined , deep down in his resolute heart , that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon . 
Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all , but as a shame and a disgrace . 
Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines , upon that one point he was inflexible . 
He had to seal his mouth on the subject , however , for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints . 
Yes , a dangerous matter -- so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath , lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued , and bring down a swift retribution upon them . 
The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account , and persecutors of the most terrible description . 
Not the Inquisition of Seville , nor the German Vehm-gericht , nor the Secret Societies of Italy , were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of Utah . 
Its invisibility , and the mystery which was attached to it , made this organization doubly terrible . 
It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent , and yet was neither seen nor heard . 
The man who held out against the Church vanished away , and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him . 
His wife and his children awaited him at home , but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges . 
A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation , and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them . 
No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling , and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them . 
At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who , having embraced the Mormon faith , wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it . 
Soon , however , it took a wider range . 
The supply of adult women was running short , and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed . 
Strange rumours began to be bandied about -- rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen . 
Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders -- women who pined and wept , and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror . 
Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men , masked , stealthy , and noiseless , who flitted by them in the darkness . 
These tales and rumours took substance and shape , and were corroborated and re-corroborated , until they resolved themselves into a definite name . 
To this day , in the lonely ranches of the West , the name of the Danite Band , or the Avenging Angels , is a sinister and an ill-omened one . 
Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men . 
None knew who belonged to this ruthless society . 
The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret . 
The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission , might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation . 
Hence every man feared his neighbour , and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart . 
One fine morning , John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields , when he heard the click of the latch , and , looking through the window , saw a stout , sandy-haired , middle-aged man coming up the pathway . 
His heart leapt to his mouth , for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself . 
Full of trepidation -- for he knew that such a visit boded him little good -- Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief . 
The latter , however , received his salutations coldly , and followed him with a stern face into the sitting-room . 
`` Brother Ferrier , '' he said , taking a seat , and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his light-coloured eyelashes , `` the true believers have been good friends to you . 
We picked you up when you were starving in the desert , we shared our food with you , led you safe to the Chosen Valley , gave you a goodly share of land , and allowed you to wax rich under our protection . 
Is not this so ? '' 
`` It is so , '' answered John Ferrier . 
`` In return for all this we asked but one condition : that was , that you should embrace the true faith , and conform in every way to its usages . 
This you promised to do , and this , if common report says truly , you have neglected . '' 
`` And how have I neglected it ? '' 
asked Ferrier , throwing out his hands in expostulation . 
`` Have I not given to the common fund ? 
Have I not attended at the Temple ? 
Have I not -- -- ? '' 
`` Where are your wives ? '' 
asked Young , looking round him . 
`` Call them in , that I may greet them . '' 
`` It is true that I have not married , '' Ferrier answered . 
`` But women were few , and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man : I had my daughter to attend to my wants . '' 
`` It is of that daughter that I would speak to you , '' said the leader of the Mormons . 
`` She has grown to be the flower of Utah , and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land . '' 
John Ferrier groaned internally . 
`` There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve -- stories that she is sealed to some Gentile . 
This must be the gossip of idle tongues . 
What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith ? 
'Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect ; for if she wed a Gentile , she commits a grievous sin . ' 
This being so , it is impossible that you , who profess the holy creed , should suffer your daughter to violate it . '' 
John Ferrier made no answer , but he played nervously with his riding-whip . 
`` Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested -- so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four . 
The girl is young , and we would not have her wed grey hairs , neither would we deprive her of all choice . 
We Elders have many heifers , [ 29 ] but our children must also be provided . 
Stangerson has a son , and Drebber has a son , and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house . 
Let her choose between them . 
They are young and rich , and of the true faith . 
What say you to that ? '' 
Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted . 
`` You will give us time , '' he said at last . 
`` My daughter is very young -- she is scarce of an age to marry . '' 
`` She shall have a month to choose , '' said Young , rising from his seat . 
`` At the end of that time she shall give her answer . '' 
He was passing through the door , when he turned , with flushed face and flashing eyes . 
`` It were better for you , John Ferrier , '' he thundered , `` that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco , than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four ! '' 
With a threatening gesture of his hand , he turned from the door , and Ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path . 
He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees , considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his , and looking up , he saw her standing beside him . 
One glance at her pale , frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed . 
`` I could not help it , '' she said , in answer to his look . 
`` His voice rang through the house . 
Oh , father , father , what shall we do ? '' 
`` Do n't you scare yourself , '' he answered , drawing her to him , and passing his broad , rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair . 
`` We 'll fix it up somehow or another . 
You do n't find your fancy kind o ' lessening for this chap , do you ? '' 
A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer . 
`` No ; of course not . 
I should n't care to hear you say you did . 
He 's a likely lad , and he 's a Christian , which is more than these folk here , in spite o ' all their praying and preaching . 
There 's a party starting for Nevada to-morrow , and I 'll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in . 
If I know anything o ' that young man , he 'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs . '' 
Lucy laughed through her tears at her father 's description . 
`` When he comes , he will advise us for the best . 
But it is for you that I am frightened , dear . 
One hears -- one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet : something terrible always happens to them . '' 
`` But we have n't opposed him yet , '' her father answered . 
`` It will be time to look out for squalls when we do . 
We have a clear month before us ; at the end of that , I guess we had best shin out of Utah . '' 
`` Leave Utah ! '' 
`` That 's about the size of it . '' 
`` But the farm ? '' 
`` We will raise as much as we can in money , and let the rest go . 
To tell the truth , Lucy , it is n't the first time I have thought of doing it . 
I do n't care about knuckling under to any man , as these folk do to their darned prophet . 
I 'm a free-born American , and it 's all new to me . 
Guess I 'm too old to learn . 
If he comes browsing about this farm , he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction . '' 
`` But they wo n't let us leave , '' his daughter objected . 
`` Wait till Jefferson comes , and we 'll soon manage that . 
In the meantime , do n't you fret yourself , my dearie , and do n't get your eyes swelled up , else he 'll be walking into me when he sees you . 
There 's nothing to be afeared about , and there 's no danger at all . '' 
John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone , but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night , and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom . 
. 
A FLIGHT FOR LIFE . 
ON the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet , John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City , and having found his acquaintance , who was bound for the Nevada Mountains , he entrusted him with his message to Jefferson Hope . 
In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them , and how necessary it was that he should return . 
Having done thus he felt easier in his mind , and returned home with a lighter heart . 
As he approached his farm , he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate . 
Still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room . 
One , with a long pale face , was leaning back in the rocking-chair , with his feet cocked up upon the stove . 
The other , a bull-necked youth with coarse bloated features , was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pocket , whistling a popular hymn . 
Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered , and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation . 
`` Maybe you do n't know us , '' he said . 
`` This here is the son of Elder Drebber , and I 'm Joseph Stangerson , who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold . '' 
`` As He will all the nations in His own good time , '' said the other in a nasal voice ; `` He grindeth slowly but exceeding small . '' 
John Ferrier bowed coldly . 
He had guessed who his visitors were . 
`` We have come , '' continued Stangerson , `` at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her . 
As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven , it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one . '' 
`` Nay , nay , Brother Stangerson , '' cried the other ; `` the question is not how many wives we have , but how many we can keep . 
My father has now given over his mills to me , and I am the richer man . '' 
`` But my prospects are better , '' said the other , warmly . 
`` When the Lord removes my father , I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory . 
Then I am your elder , and am higher in the Church . '' 
`` It will be for the maiden to decide , '' rejoined young Drebber , smirking at his own reflection in the glass . 
`` We will leave it all to her decision . '' 
During this dialogue , John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway , hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors . 
`` Look here , '' he said at last , striding up to them , `` when my daughter summons you , you can come , but until then I do n't want to see your faces again . '' 
The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement . 
In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden 's hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father . 
`` There are two ways out of the room , '' cried Ferrier ; `` there is the door , and there is the window . 
Which do you care to use ? '' 
His brown face looked so savage , and his gaunt hands so threatening , that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat . 
The old farmer followed them to the door . 
`` Let me know when you have settled which it is to be , '' he said , sardonically . 
`` You shall smart for this ! '' 
Stangerson cried , white with rage . 
`` You have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four . 
You shall rue it to the end of your days . '' 
`` The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you , '' cried young Drebber ; `` He will arise and smite you ! '' 
`` Then I 'll start the smiting , '' exclaimed Ferrier furiously , and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him . 
Before he could escape from her , the clatter of horses' hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach . 
`` The young canting rascals ! '' 
he exclaimed , wiping the perspiration from his forehead ; `` I would sooner see you in your grave , my girl , than the wife of either of them . '' 
`` And so should I , father , '' she answered , with spirit ; `` but Jefferson will soon be here . '' 
`` Yes . 
It will not be long before he comes . 
The sooner the better , for we do not know what their next move may be . '' 
It was , indeed , high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter . 
In the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders . 
If minor errors were punished so sternly , what would be the fate of this arch rebel . 
Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him . 
Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now , and their goods given over to the Church . 
He was a brave man , but he trembled at the vague , shadowy terrors which hung over him . 
Any known danger he could face with a firm lip , but this suspense was unnerving . 
He concealed his fears from his daughter , however , and affected to make light of the whole matter , though she , with the keen eye of love , saw plainly that he was ill at ease . 
He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct , and he was not mistaken , though it came in an unlooked-for manner . 
Upon rising next morning he found , to his surprise , a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest . 
On it was printed , in bold straggling letters : -- `` Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment , and then -- -- '' The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been . 
How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely , for his servants slept in an outhouse , and the doors and windows had all been secured . 
He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter , but the incident struck a chill into his heart . 
The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised . 
What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers ? 
The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart , and he could never have known who had slain him . 
Still more shaken was he next morning . 
They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards . 
In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled , with a burned stick apparently , the number 28 . 
To his daughter it was unintelligible , and he did not enlighten her . 
That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward . 
He saw and he heard nothing , and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door . 
Thus day followed day ; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register , and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace . 
Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls , sometimes upon the floors , occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings . 
With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded . 
A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them . 
He became haggard and restless , and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature . 
He had but one hope in life now , and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada . 
Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten , but there was no news of the absentee . 
One by one the numbers dwindled down , and still there came no sign of him . 
Whenever a horseman clattered down the road , or a driver shouted at his team , the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last . 
At last , when he saw five give way to four and that again to three , he lost heart , and abandoned all hope of escape . 
Single-handed , and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement , he knew that he was powerless . 
The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded , and none could pass along them without an order from the Council . 
Turn which way he would , there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him . 
Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter 's dishonour . 
He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles , and searching vainly for some way out of them . 
That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house , and the next day would be the last of the allotted time . 
What was to happen then ? 
All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination . 
And his daughter -- what was to become of her after he was gone ? 
Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them . 
He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence . 
What was that ? 
In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound -- low , but very distinct in the quiet of the night . 
It came from the door of the house . 
Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently . 
There was a pause for a few moments , and then the low insidious sound was repeated . 
Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door . 
Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal ? 
Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived . 
John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart . 
Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open . 
Outside all was calm and quiet . 
The night was fine , and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead . 
The little front garden lay before the farmer 's eyes bounded by the fence and gate , but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen . 
With a sigh of relief , Ferrier looked to right and to left , until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground , with arms and legs all asprawl . 
So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out . 
His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man , but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent . 
Once within the house the man sprang to his feet , closed the door , and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope . 
`` Good God ! '' 
gasped John Ferrier . 
`` How you scared me ! 
Whatever made you come in like that . '' 
`` Give me food , '' the other said , hoarsely . 
`` I have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours . '' 
He flung himself upon the [ 21 ] cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host's supper , and devoured it voraciously . 
`` Does Lucy bear up well ? '' 
he asked , when he had satisfied his hunger . 
`` Yes . 
She does not know the danger , '' her father answered . 
`` That is well . 
The house is watched on every side . 
That is why I crawled my way up to it . 
They may be darned sharp , but they 're not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter . '' 
John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally . 
He seized the young man 's leathery hand and wrung it cordially . 
`` You 're a man to be proud of , '' he said . 
`` There are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles . '' 
`` You 've hit it there , pard , '' the young hunter answered . 
`` I have a respect for you , but if you were alone in this business I 'd think twice before I put my head into such a hornet 's nest . 
It 's Lucy that brings me here , and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o ' the Hope family in Utah . '' 
`` What are we to do ? '' 
`` To-morrow is your last day , and unless you act to-night you are lost . 
I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine . 
How much money have you ? '' 
`` Two thousand dollars in gold , and five in notes . '' 
`` That will do . 
I have as much more to add to it . 
We must push for Carson City through the mountains . 
You had best wake Lucy . 
It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house . '' 
While Ferrier was absent , preparing his daughter for the approaching journey , Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel , and filled a stoneware jar with water , for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between . 
He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start . 
The greeting between the lovers was warm , but brief , for minutes were precious , and there was much to be done . 
`` We must make our start at once , '' said Jefferson Hope , speaking in a low but resolute voice , like one who realizes the greatness of the peril , but has steeled his heart to meet it . 
`` The front and back entrances are watched , but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields . 
Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting . 
By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains . '' 
`` What if we are stopped , '' asked Ferrier . 
Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic . 
`` If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us , '' he said with a sinister smile . 
The lights inside the house had all been extinguished , and from the darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own , and which he was now about to abandon for ever . 
He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice , however , and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes . 
All looked so peaceful and happy , the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land , that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all . 
Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head . 
Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes , Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water , while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions . 
Opening the window very slowly and carefully , they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night , and then one by one passed through into the little garden . 
With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it , and gained the shelter of the hedge , which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields . 
They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow , where they lay silent and trembling . 
It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx . 
He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them , which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance . 
At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making , and uttered the plaintive signal cry again , on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity . 
`` To-morrow at midnight , '' said the first who appeared to be in authority . 
`` When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times . '' 
`` It is well , '' returned the other . 
`` Shall I tell Brother Drebber ? '' 
`` Pass it on to him , and from him to the others . 
Nine to seven ! '' 
`` Seven to five ! '' 
repeated the other , and the two figures flitted away in different directions . 
Their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign . 
The instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance , Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet , and helping his companions through the gap , led the way across the fields at the top of his speed , supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her . 
`` Hurry on ! 
hurry on ! '' 
he gasped from time to time . 
`` We are through the line of sentinels . 
Everything depends on speed . 
Hurry on ! '' 
Once on the high road they made rapid progress . 
Only once did they meet anyone , and then they managed to slip into a field , and so avoid recognition . 
Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains . 
Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness , and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Canon in which the horses were awaiting them . 
With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse , until he came to the retired corner , screened with rocks , where the faithful animals had been picketed . 
The girl was placed upon the mule , and old Ferrier upon one of the horses , with his money-bag , while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path . 
It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest moods . 
On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more , black , stern , and menacing , with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster . 
On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible . 
Between the two ran the irregular track , so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file , and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all . 
Yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties , the hearts of the fugitives were light within them , for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying . 
They soon had a proof , however , that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints . 
They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry , and pointed upwards . 
On a rock which overlooked the track , showing out dark and plain against the sky , there stood a solitary sentinel . 
He saw them as soon as they perceived him , and his military challenge of `` Who goes there ? '' 
rang through the silent ravine . 
`` Travellers for Nevada , '' said Jefferson Hope , with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle . 
They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun , and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply . 
`` By whose permission ? '' 
he asked . 
`` The Holy Four , '' answered Ferrier . 
His Mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer . 
`` Nine from seven , '' cried the sentinel . 
`` Seven from five , '' returned Jefferson Hope promptly , remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden . 
`` Pass , and the Lord go with you , '' said the voice from above . 
Beyond his post the path broadened out , and the horses were able to break into a trot . 
Looking back , they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun , and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people , and that freedom lay before them . 
. 
THE AVENGING ANGELS . 
ALL night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and rock-strewn paths . 
More than once they lost their way , but Hope's intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more . 
When morning broke , a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them . 
In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in , peeping over each other 's shoulders to the far horizon . 
So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them , that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads , and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them . 
Nor was the fear entirely an illusion , for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner . 
Even as they passed , a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges , and startled the weary horses into a gallop . 
As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon , the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other , like lamps at a festival , until they were all ruddy and glowing . 
The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy . 
At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses , while they partook of a hasty breakfast . 
Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer , but Jefferson Hope was inexorable . 
`` They will be upon our track by this time , '' he said . 
`` Everything depends upon our speed . 
Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives . '' 
During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles , and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies . 
At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag , where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind , and there huddled together for warmth , they enjoyed a few hours ' sleep . 
Before daybreak , however , they were up and on their way once more . 
They had seen no signs of any pursuers , and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred . 
He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach , or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them . 
About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out . 
This gave the hunter little uneasiness , however , for there was game to be had among the mountains , and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life . 
Choosing a sheltered nook , he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire , at which his companions might warm themselves , for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level , and the air was bitter and keen . 
Having tethered the horses , and bade Lucy adieu , he threw his gun over his shoulder , and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way . 
Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire , while the three animals stood motionless in the back-ground . 
Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view . 
He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success , though from the marks upon the bark of the trees , and other indications , he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity . 
At last , after two or three hours ' fruitless search , he was thinking of turning back in despair , when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart . 
On the edge of a jutting pinnacle , three or four hundred feet above him , there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance , but armed with a pair of gigantic horns . 
The big-horn -- for so it is called -- was acting , probably , as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter ; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction , and had not perceived him . 
Lying on his face , he rested his rifle upon a rock , and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger . 
The animal sprang into the air , tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice , and then came crashing down into the valley beneath . 
The creature was too unwieldy to lift , so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank . 
With this trophy over his shoulder , he hastened to retrace his steps , for the evening was already drawing in . 
He had hardly started , however , before he realized the difficulty which faced him . 
In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him , and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken . 
The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges , which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other . 
He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before . 
Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn , he tried another , but with the same result . 
Night was coming on rapidly , and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him . 
Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track , for the moon had not yet risen , and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound . 
Weighed down with his burden , and weary from his exertions , he stumbled along , keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy , and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey . 
He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them . 
Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it . 
They must , he reflected , be awaiting him anxiously , for he had been absent nearly five hours . 
In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming . 
He paused and listened for an answer . 
None came save his own cry , which clattered up the dreary silent ravines , and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions . 
Again he shouted , even louder than before , and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago . 
A vague , nameless dread came over him , and he hurried onwards frantically , dropping the precious food in his agitation . 
When he turned the corner , he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit . 
There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there , but it had evidently not been tended since his departure . 
The same dead silence still reigned all round . 
With his fears all changed to convictions , he hurried on . 
There was no living creature near the remains of the fire : animals , man , maiden , all were gone . 
It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence -- a disaster which had embraced them all , and yet had left no traces behind it . 
Bewildered and stunned by this blow , Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round , and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling . 
He was essentially a man of action , however , and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence . 
Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire , he blew it into a flame , and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp . 
The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses , showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives , and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City . 
Had they carried back both of his companions with them ? 
Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so , when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him . 
A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil , which had assuredly not been there before . 
There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave . 
As the young hunter approached it , he perceived that a stick had been planted on it , with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it . 
The inscription upon the paper was brief , but to the point : JOHN FERRIER , FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY , [ 22 ] Died August 4th , 1860 . 
The sturdy old man , whom he had left so short a time before , was gone , then , and this was all his epitaph . 
Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave , but there was no sign of one . 
Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny , by becoming one of the harem of the Elder 's son . 
As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate , and his own powerlessness to prevent it , he wished that he , too , was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place . 
Again , however , his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair . 
If there was nothing else left to him , he could at least devote his life to revenge . 
With indomitable patience and perseverance , Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness , which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived . 
As he stood by the desolate fire , he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution , brought by his own hand upon his enemies . 
His strong will and untiring energy should , he determined , be devoted to that one end . 
With a grim , white face , he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food , and having stirred up the smouldering fire , he cooked enough to last him for a few days . 
This he made up into a bundle , and , tired as he was , he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels . 
For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback . 
At night he flung himself down among the rocks , and snatched a few hours of sleep ; but before daybreak he was always well on his way . 
On the sixth day , he reached the Eagle Canon , from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight . 
Thence he could look down upon the home of the saints . 
Worn and exhausted , he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him . 
As he looked at it , he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets , and other signs of festivity . 
He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse 's hoofs , and saw a mounted man riding towards him . 
As he approached , he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper , to whom he had rendered services at different times . 
He therefore accosted him when he got up to him , with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier 's fate had been . 
`` I am Jefferson Hope , '' he said . 
`` You remember me . '' 
The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment -- indeed , it was difficult to recognize in this tattered , unkempt wanderer , with ghastly white face and fierce , wild eyes , the spruce young hunter of former days . 
Having , however , at last , satisfied himself as to his identity , the man 's surprise changed to consternation . 
`` You are mad to come here , '' he cried . 
`` It is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you . 
There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away . '' 
`` I do n't fear them , or their warrant , '' Hope said , earnestly . 
`` You must know something of this matter , Cowper . 
I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions . 
We have always been friends . 
For God 's sake , do n't refuse to answer me . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
the Mormon asked uneasily . 
`` Be quick . 
The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes . '' 
`` What has become of Lucy Ferrier ? '' 
`` She was married yesterday to young Drebber . 
Hold up , man , hold up , you have no life left in you . '' 
`` Do n't mind me , '' said Hope faintly . 
He was white to the very lips , and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning . 
`` Married , you say ? '' 
`` Married yesterday -- that 's what those flags are for on the Endowment House . 
There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her . 
They 'd both been in the party that followed them , and Stangerson had shot her father , which seemed to give him the best claim ; but when they argued it out in council , Drebber 's party was the stronger , so the Prophet gave her over to him . 
No one wo n't have her very long though , for I saw death in her face yesterday . 
She is more like a ghost than a woman . 
Are you off , then ? '' 
`` Yes , I am off , '' said Jefferson Hope , who had risen from his seat . 
His face might have been chiselled out of marble , so hard and set was its expression , while its eyes glowed with a baleful light . 
`` Where are you going ? '' 
`` Never mind , '' he answered ; and , slinging his weapon over his shoulder , strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts . 
Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself . 
The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled . 
Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced , poor Lucy never held up her head again , but pined away and died within a month . 
Her sottish husband , who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier 's property , did not affect any great grief at his bereavement ; but his other wives mourned over her , and sat up with her the night before the burial , as is the Mormon custom . 
They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning , when , to their inexpressible fear and astonishment , the door was flung open , and a savage-looking , weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room . 
Without a glance or a word to the cowering women , he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier . 
Stooping over her , he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead , and then , snatching up her hand , he took the wedding-ring from her finger . 
`` She shall not be buried in that , '' he cried with a fierce snarl , and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone . 
So strange and so brief was the episode , that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it , had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared . 
For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains , leading a strange wild life , and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him . 
Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs , and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges . 
Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him . 
On another occasion , as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him , and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face . 
The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives , and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy , but always without success . 
Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall , and of having their houses guarded . 
After a time they were able to relax these measures , for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent , and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness . 
Far from doing so , it had , if anything , augmented it . 
The hunter 's mind was of a hard , unyielding nature , and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion . 
He was , however , above all things practical . 
He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it . 
Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out . 
If he died like a dog among the mountains , what was to become of his revenge then ? 
And yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted . 
He felt that that was to play his enemy's game , so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines , there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation . 
His intention had been to be absent a year at the most , but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five . 
At the end of that time , however , his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier 's grave . 
Disguised , and under an assumed name , he returned to Salt Lake City , careless what became of his own life , as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice . 
There he found evil tidings awaiting him . 
There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before , some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders , and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents , who had left Utah and become Gentiles . 
Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson ; and no one knew whither they had gone . 
Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money , and that he had departed a wealthy man , while his companion , Stangerson , was comparatively poor . 
There was no clue at all , however , as to their whereabouts . 
Many a man , however vindictive , would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty , but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment . 
With the small competence he possessed , eked out by such employment as he could pick up , he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies . 
Year passed into year , his black hair turned grizzled , but still he wandered on , a human bloodhound , with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life . 
At last his perseverance was rewarded . 
It was but a glance of a face in a window , but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of . 
He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged . 
It chanced , however , that Drebber , looking from his window , had recognized the vagrant in the street , and had read murder in his eyes . 
He hurried before a justice of the peace , accompanied by Stangerson , who had become his private secretary , and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival . 
That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody , and not being able to find sureties , was detained for some weeks . 
When at last he was liberated , it was only to find that Drebber 's house was deserted , and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe . 
Again the avenger had been foiled , and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit . 
Funds were wanting , however , and for some time he had to return to work , saving every dollar for his approaching journey . 
At last , having collected enough to keep life in him , he departed for Europe , and tracked his enemies from city to city , working his way in any menial capacity , but never overtaking the fugitives . 
When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris ; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen . 
At the Danish capital he was again a few days late , for they had journeyed on to London , where he at last succeeded in running them to earth . 
As to what occurred there , we can not do better than quote the old hunter 's own account , as duly recorded in Dr. Watson 's Journal , to which we are already under such obligations . 
. 
A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON , M.D . 
OUR prisoner 's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves , for on finding himself powerless , he smiled in an affable manner , and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle . 
`` I guess you 're going to take me to the police-station , '' he remarked to Sherlock Holmes . 
`` My cab 's at the door . 
If you 'll loose my legs I 'll walk down to it . 
I 'm not so light to lift as I used to be . '' 
Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one ; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word , and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles . 
[ 23 ] He rose and stretched his legs , as though to assure himself that they were free once more . 
I remember that I thought to myself , as I eyed him , that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man ; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength . 
`` If there 's a vacant place for a chief of the police , I reckon you are the man for it , '' he said , gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger . 
`` The way you kept on my trail was a caution . '' 
`` You had better come with me , '' said Holmes to the two detectives . 
`` I can drive you , '' said Lestrade . 
`` Good ! 
and Gregson can come inside with me . 
You too , Doctor , you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us . '' 
I assented gladly , and we all descended together . 
Our prisoner made no attempt at escape , but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his , and we followed him . 
Lestrade mounted the box , whipped up the horse , and brought us in a very short time to our destination . 
We were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner 's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged . 
The official was a white-faced unemotional man , who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way . 
`` The prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week , '' he said ; `` in the mean time , Mr. Jefferson Hope , have you anything that you wish to say ? 
I must warn you that your words will be taken down , and may be used against you . '' 
`` I 've got a good deal to say , '' our prisoner said slowly . 
`` I want to tell you gentlemen all about it . '' 
`` Had n't you better reserve that for your trial ? '' 
asked the Inspector . 
`` I may never be tried , '' he answered . 
`` You need n't look startled . 
It is n't suicide I am thinking of . 
Are you a Doctor ? '' 
He turned his fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question . 
`` Yes ; I am , '' I answered . 
`` Then put your hand here , '' he said , with a smile , motioning with his manacled wrists towards his chest . 
I did so ; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside . 
The walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work . 
In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source . 
`` Why , '' I cried , `` you have an aortic aneurism ! '' 
`` That 's what they call it , '' he said , placidly . 
`` I went to a Doctor last week about it , and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed . 
It has been getting worse for years . 
I got it from over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains . 
I 've done my work now , and I do n't care how soon I go , but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me . 
I do n't want to be remembered as a common cut-throat . '' 
The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him to tell his story . 
`` Do you consider , Doctor , that there is immediate danger ? '' 
the former asked , [ 24 ] `` Most certainly there is , '' I answered . 
`` In that case it is clearly our duty , in the interests of justice , to take his statement , '' said the Inspector . 
`` You are at liberty , sir , to give your account , which I again warn you will be taken down . '' 
`` I 'll sit down , with your leave , '' the prisoner said , suiting the action to the word . 
`` This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired , and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters . 
I 'm on the brink of the grave , and I am not likely to lie to you . 
Every word I say is the absolute truth , and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me . '' 
With these words , Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement . 
He spoke in a calm and methodical manner , as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough . 
I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account , for I have had access to Lestrade 's note-book , in which the prisoner 's words were taken down exactly as they were uttered . 
`` It do n't much matter to you why I hated these men , '' he said ; `` it's enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings -- a father and a daughter -- and that they had , therefore , forfeited their own lives . 
After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime , it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court . 
I knew of their guilt though , and I determined that I should be judge , jury , and executioner all rolled into one . 
You 'd have done the same , if you have any manhood in you , if you had been in my place . 
`` That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago . 
She was forced into marrying that same Drebber , and broke her heart over it . 
I took the marriage ring from her dead finger , and I vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring , and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished . 
I have carried it about with me , and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until I caught them . 
They thought to tire me out , but they could not do it . 
If I die to-morrow , as is likely enough , I die knowing that my work in this world is done , and well done . 
They have perished , and by my hand . 
There is nothing left for me to hope for , or to desire . 
`` They were rich and I was poor , so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them . 
When I got to London my pocket was about empty , and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living . 
Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking , so I applied at a cabowner 's office , and soon got employment . 
I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner , and whatever was over that I might keep for myself . 
There was seldom much over , but I managed to scrape along somehow . 
The hardest job was to learn my way about , for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived , this city is the most confusing . 
I had a map beside me though , and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations , I got on pretty well . 
`` It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living ; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them . 
They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell , over on the other side of the river . 
When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy . 
I had grown my beard , and there was no chance of their recognizing me . 
I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity . 
I was determined that they should not escape me again . 
`` They were very near doing it for all that . 
Go where they would about London , I was always at their heels . 
Sometimes I followed them on my cab , and sometimes on foot , but the former was the best , for then they could not get away from me . 
It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything , so that I began to get behind hand with my employer . 
I did not mind that , however , as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted . 
`` They were very cunning , though . 
They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed , for they would never go out alone , and never after nightfall . 
During two weeks I drove behind them every day , and never once saw them separate . 
Drebber himself was drunk half the time , but Stangerson was not to be caught napping . 
I watched them late and early , but never saw the ghost of a chance ; but I was not discouraged , for something told me that the hour had almost come . 
My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone . 
`` At last , one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace , as the street was called in which they boarded , when I saw a cab drive up to their door . 
Presently some luggage was brought out , and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it , and drove off . 
I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them , feeling very ill at ease , for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters . 
At Euston Station they got out , and I left a boy to hold my horse , and followed them on to the platform . 
I heard them ask for the Liverpool train , and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours . 
Stangerson seemed to be put out at that , but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise . 
I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them . 
Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do , and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him . 
His companion remonstrated with him , and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together . 
Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one , and that he must go alone . 
I could not catch what Stangerson said to that , but the other burst out swearing , and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant , and that he must not presume to dictate to him . 
On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job , and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday 's Private Hotel ; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven , and made his way out of the station . 
`` The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come . 
I had my enemies within my power . 
Together they could protect each other , but singly they were at my mercy . 
I did not act , however , with undue precipitation . 
My plans were already formed . 
There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him , and why retribution has come upon him . 
I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out . 
It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage . 
It was claimed that same evening , and returned ; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it , and had a duplicate constructed . 
By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption . 
How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve . 
`` He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops , staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them . 
When he came out he staggered in his walk , and was evidently pretty well on . 
There was a hansom just in front of me , and he hailed it . 
I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way . 
We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets , until , to my astonishment , we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded . 
I could not imagine what his intention was in returning there ; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house . 
He entered it , and his hansom drove away . 
Give me a glass of water , if you please . 
My mouth gets dry with the talking . '' 
I handed him the glass , and he drank it down . 
`` That 's better , '' he said . 
`` Well , I waited for a quarter of an hour , or more , when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house . 
Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared , one of whom was Drebber , and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before . 
This fellow had Drebber by the collar , and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road . 
'You hound , ' he cried , shaking his stick at him ; ' I'll teach you to insult an honest girl ! ' 
He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel , only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him . 
He ran as far as the corner , and then , seeing my cab , he hailed me and jumped in . 
'Drive me to Halliday 's Private Hotel , ' said he . 
`` When I had him fairly inside my cab , my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong . 
I drove along slowly , weighing in my own mind what it was best to do . 
I might take him right out into the country , and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him . 
I had almost decided upon this , when he solved the problem for me . 
The craze for drink had seized him again , and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace . 
He went in , leaving word that I should wait for him . 
There he remained until closing time , and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands . 
`` Do n't imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood . 
It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so , but I could not bring myself to do it . 
I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it . 
Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life , I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College . 
One day the professor was lecturing on poisions , [ 25 ] and he showed his students some alkaloid , as he called it , which he had extracted from some South American arrow poison , and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death . 
I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept , and when they were all gone , I helped myself to a little of it . 
I was a fairly good dispenser , so I worked this alkaloid into small , soluble pills , and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison . 
I determined at the time that when I had my chance , my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes , while I ate the pill that remained . 
It would be quite as deadly , and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief . 
From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me , and the time had now come when I was to use them . 
`` It was nearer one than twelve , and a wild , bleak night , blowing hard and raining in torrents . 
Dismal as it was outside , I was glad within -- so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation . 
If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing , and longed for it during twenty long years , and then suddenly found it within your reach , you would understand my feelings . 
I lit a cigar , and puffed at it to steady my nerves , but my hands were trembling , and my temples throbbing with excitement . 
As I drove , I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me , just as plain as I see you all in this room . 
All the way they were ahead of me , one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road . 
`` There was not a soul to be seen , nor a sound to be heard , except the dripping of the rain . 
When I looked in at the window , I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep . 
I shook him by the arm , 'It's time to get out , ' I said . 
`` 'All right , cabby , ' said he . 
`` I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned , for he got out without another word , and followed me down the garden . 
I had to walk beside him to keep him steady , for he was still a little top-heavy . 
When we came to the door , I opened it , and led him into the front room . 
I give you my word that all the way , the father and the daughter were walking in front of us . 
`` 'It 's infernally dark , ' said he , stamping about . 
`` 'We 'll soon have a light , ' I said , striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me . 
'Now , Enoch Drebber , ' I continued , turning to him , and holding the light to my own face , 'who am I ? ' 
`` He gazed at me with bleared , drunken eyes for a moment , and then I saw a horror spring up in them , and convulse his whole features , which showed me that he knew me . 
He staggered back with a livid face , and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow , while his teeth chattered in his head . 
At the sight , I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long . 
I had always known that vengeance would be sweet , but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me . 
`` 'You dog ! ' 
I said ; ' I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg , and you have always escaped me . 
Now , at last your wanderings have come to an end , for either you or I shall never see to-morrow 's sun rise . ' 
He shrunk still further away as I spoke , and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad . 
So I was for the time . 
The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers , and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me . 
`` 'What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now ? ' 
I cried , locking the door , and shaking the key in his face . 
'Punishment has been slow in coming , but it has overtaken you at last . ' 
I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke . 
He would have begged for his life , but he knew well that it was useless . 
`` 'Would you murder me ? ' 
he stammered . 
`` 'There is no murder , ' I answered . 
'Who talks of murdering a mad dog ? 
What mercy had you upon my poor darling , when you dragged her from her slaughtered father , and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem . ' 
`` 'It was not I who killed her father , ' he cried . 
`` 'But it was you who broke her innocent heart , ' I shrieked , thrusting the box before him . 
'Let the high God judge between us . 
Choose and eat . 
There is death in one and life in the other . 
I shall take what you leave . 
Let us see if there is justice upon the earth , or if we are ruled by chance . ' 
`` He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy , but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me . 
Then I swallowed the other , and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more , waiting to see which was to live and which was to die . 
Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system ? 
I laughed as I saw it , and held Lucy 's marriage ring in front of his eyes . 
It was but for a moment , for the action of the alkaloid is rapid . 
A spasm of pain contorted his features ; he threw his hands out in front of him , staggered , and then , with a hoarse cry , fell heavily upon the floor . 
I turned him over with my foot , and placed my hand upon his heart . 
There was no movement . 
He was dead ! 
`` The blood had been streaming from my nose , but I had taken no notice of it . 
I do n't know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it . 
Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track , for I felt light-hearted and cheerful . 
I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him , and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it . 
I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners , so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall . 
Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about , and that the night was still very wild . 
I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy 's ring , and found that it was not there . 
I was thunderstruck at this , for it was the only memento that I had of her . 
Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber's body , I drove back , and leaving my cab in a side street , I went boldly up to the house -- for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring . 
When I arrived there , I walked right into the arms of a police-officer who was coming out , and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk . 
`` That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end . 
All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson , and so pay off John Ferrier 's debt . 
I knew that he was staying at Halliday 's Private Hotel , and I hung about all day , but he never came out . 
[ 26 ] fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance . 
He was cunning , was Stangerson , and always on his guard . 
If he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken . 
I soon found out which was the window of his bedroom , and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel , and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn . 
I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before . 
I described Drebber 's death to him , and I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills . 
Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him , he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat . 
In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart . 
It would have been the same in any case , for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison . 
`` I have little more to say , and it 's as well , for I am about done up . 
I went on cabbing it for a day or so , intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America . 
I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope , and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B , Baker Street . 
I went round , suspecting no harm , and the next thing I knew , this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists , and as neatly snackled [ 27 ] as ever I saw in my life . 
That 's the whole of my story , gentlemen . 
You may consider me to be a murderer ; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are . '' 
So thrilling had the man 's narrative been , and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed . 
Even the professional detectives , _blase_ as they were in every detail of crime , appeared to be keenly interested in the man 's story . 
When he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of Lestrade 's pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account . 
`` There is only one point on which I should like a little more information , '' Sherlock Holmes said at last . 
`` Who was your accomplice who came for the ring which I advertised ? '' 
The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely . 
`` I can tell my own secrets , '' he said , `` but I do n't get other people into trouble . 
I saw your advertisement , and I thought it might be a plant , or it might be the ring which I wanted . 
My friend volunteered to go and see . 
I think you'll own he did it smartly . '' 
`` Not a doubt of that , '' said Holmes heartily . 
`` Now , gentlemen , '' the Inspector remarked gravely , `` the forms of the law must be complied with . 
On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates , and your attendance will be required . 
Until then I will be responsible for him . '' 
He rang the bell as he spoke , and Jefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders , while my friend and I made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street . 
. 
THE CONCLUSION . 
WE had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the Thursday ; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony . 
A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand , and Jefferson Hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him . 
On the very night after his capture the aneurism burst , and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell , with a placid smile upon his face , as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life , and on work well done . 
`` Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death , '' Holmes remarked , as we chatted it over next evening . 
`` Where will their grand advertisement be now ? '' 
`` I do n't see that they had very much to do with his capture , '' I answered . 
`` What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence , '' returned my companion , bitterly . 
`` The question is , what can you make people believe that you have done . 
Never mind , '' he continued , more brightly , after a pause . 
`` I would not have missed the investigation for anything . 
There has been no better case within my recollection . 
Simple as it was , there were several most instructive points about it . '' 
`` Simple ! '' 
I ejaculated . 
`` Well , really , it can hardly be described as otherwise , '' said Sherlock Holmes , smiling at my surprise . 
`` The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is , that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days . '' 
`` That is true , '' said I . 
`` I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance . 
In solving a problem of this sort , the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards . 
That is a very useful accomplishment , and a very easy one , but people do not practise it much . 
In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards , and so the other comes to be neglected . 
There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically . '' 
`` I confess , '' said I , `` that I do not quite follow you . '' 
`` I hardly expected that you would . 
Let me see if I can make it clearer . 
Most people , if you describe a train of events to them , will tell you what the result would be . 
They can put those events together in their minds , and argue from them that something will come to pass . 
There are few people , however , who , if you told them a result , would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result . 
This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards , or analytically . '' 
`` I understand , '' said I . 
`` Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself . 
Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning . 
To begin at the beginning . 
I approached the house , as you know , on foot , and with my mind entirely free from all impressions . 
I naturally began by examining the roadway , and there , as I have already explained to you , I saw clearly the marks of a cab , which , I ascertained by inquiry , must have been there during the night . 
I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels . 
The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman 's brougham . 
`` This was the first point gained . 
I then walked slowly down the garden path , which happened to be composed of a clay soil , peculiarly suitable for taking impressions . 
No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush , but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning . 
There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps . 
Happily , I have always laid great stress upon it , and much practice has made it second nature to me . 
I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables , but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden . 
It was easy to tell that they had been before the others , because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them . 
In this way my second link was formed , which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number , one remarkable for his height ( as I calculated from the length of his stride ) , and the other fashionably dressed , to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots . 
`` On entering the house this last inference was confirmed . 
My well-booted man lay before me . 
The tall one , then , had done the murder , if murder there was . 
There was no wound upon the dead man 's person , but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him . 
Men who die from heart disease , or any sudden natural cause , never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features . 
Having sniffed the dead man 's lips I detected a slightly sour smell , and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him . 
Again , I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face . 
By the method of exclusion , I had arrived at this result , for no other hypothesis would meet the facts . 
Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea . 
The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals . 
The cases of Dolsky in Odessa , and of Leturier in Montpellier , will occur at once to any toxicologist . 
`` And now came the great question as to the reason why . 
Robbery had not been the object of the murder , for nothing was taken . 
Was it politics , then , or was it a woman ? 
That was the question which confronted me . 
I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition . 
Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly . 
This murder had , on the contrary , been done most deliberately , and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room , showing that he had been there all the time . 
It must have been a private wrong , and not a political one , which called for such a methodical revenge . 
When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion . 
The thing was too evidently a blind . 
When the ring was found , however , it settled the question . 
Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman . 
It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber 's former career . 
He answered , you remember , in the negative . 
`` I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room , which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer 's height , and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails . 
I had already come to the conclusion , since there were no signs of a struggle , that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer 's nose in his excitement . 
I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet . 
It is seldom that any man , unless he is very full-blooded , breaks out in this way through emotion , so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man . 
Events proved that I had judged correctly . 
`` Having left the house , I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected . 
I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland , limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber . 
The answer was conclusive . 
It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love , named Jefferson Hope , and that this same Hope was at present in Europe . 
I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand , and all that remained was to secure the murderer . 
`` I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber , was none other than the man who had driven the cab . 
The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it . 
Where , then , could the driver be , unless he were inside the house ? 
Again , it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes , as it were , of a third person , who was sure to betray him . 
Lastly , supposing one man wished to dog another through London , what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver . 
All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis . 
`` If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be . 
On the contrary , from his point of view , any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself . 
He would , probably , for a time at least , continue to perform his duties . 
There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name . 
Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one ? 
I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps , and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted . 
How well they succeeded , and how quickly I took advantage of it , are still fresh in your recollection . 
The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected , but which could hardly in any case have been prevented . 
Through it , as you know , I came into possession of the pills , the existence of which I had already surmised . 
You see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw . '' 
`` It is wonderful ! '' 
I cried . 
`` Your merits should be publicly recognized . 
You should publish an account of the case . 
If you wo n't , I will for you . '' 
`` You may do what you like , Doctor , '' he answered . 
`` See here ! '' 
he continued , handing a paper over to me , `` look at this ! '' 
It was the _Echo_ for the day , and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question . 
`` The public , '' it said , `` have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man Hope , who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson . 
The details of the case will probably be never known now , though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud , in which love and Mormonism bore a part . 
It seems that both the victims belonged , in their younger days , to the Latter Day Saints , and Hope , the deceased prisoner , hails also from Salt Lake City . 
If the case has had no other effect , it , at least , brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force , and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home , and not to carry them on to British soil . 
It is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard officials , Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson . 
The man was apprehended , it appears , in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes , who has himself , as an amateur , shown some talent in the detective line , and who , with such instructors , may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill . 
It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services . '' 
`` Did n't I tell you so when we started ? '' 
cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh . 
`` That 's the result of all our Study in Scarlet : to get them a testimonial ! '' 
`` Never mind , '' I answered , `` I have all the facts in my journal , and the public shall know them . 
In the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success , like the Roman miser -- `` 'Populus me sibilat , at mihi plaudo Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca . ' ''

THE AUTHOR . 
HUCKLEBERRY FINN Scene : The Mississippi Valley Time : Forty to fifty years ago . 
YOU do n't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ; but that ai n't no matter . 
That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain , and he told the truth , mainly . 
There was things which he stretched , but mainly he told the truth . 
That is nothing . 
I never seen anybody but lied one time or another , without it was Aunt Polly , or the widow , or maybe Mary . 
Aunt Polly -- Tom 's Aunt Polly , she is -- and Mary , and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book , which is mostly a true book , with some stretchers , as I said before . 
Now the way that the book winds up is this : Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave , and it made us rich . 
We got six thousand dollars apiece -- all gold . 
It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up . 
Well , Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest , and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round -- more than a body could tell what to do with . 
The Widow Douglas she took me for her son , and allowed she would sivilize me ; but it was rough living in the house all the time , considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways ; and so when I could n't stand it no longer I lit out . 
I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again , and was free and satisfied . 
But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers , and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable . 
So I went back . 
The widow she cried over me , and called me a poor lost lamb , and she called me a lot of other names , too , but she never meant no harm by it . 
She put me in them new clothes again , and I could n't do nothing but sweat and sweat , and feel all cramped up . 
Well , then , the old thing commenced again . 
The widow rung a bell for supper , and you had to come to time . 
When you got to the table you could n't go right to eating , but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals , though there war n't really anything the matter with them , -- that is , nothing only everything was cooked by itself . 
In a barrel of odds and ends it is different ; things get mixed up , and the juice kind of swaps around , and the things go better . 
After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers , and I was in a sweat to find out all about him ; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time ; so then I did n't care no more about him , because I do n't take no stock in dead people . 
Pretty soon I wanted to smoke , and asked the widow to let me . 
But she would n't . 
She said it was a mean practice and was n't clean , and I must try to not do it any more . 
That is just the way with some people . 
They get down on a thing when they do n't know nothing about it . 
Here she was a-bothering about Moses , which was no kin to her , and no use to anybody , being gone , you see , yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it . 
And she took snuff , too ; of course that was all right , because she done it herself . 
Her sister , Miss Watson , a tolerable slim old maid , with goggles on , had just come to live with her , and took a set at me now with a spelling-book . 
She worked me middling hard for about an hour , and then the widow made her ease up . 
I could n't stood it much longer . 
Then for an hour it was deadly dull , and I was fidgety . 
Miss Watson would say , Do n't put your feet up there , Huckleberry ; and Do n't scrunch up like that , Huckleberry -- set up straight ; and pretty soon she would say , Do n't gap and stretch like that , Huckleberry -- why do n't you try to behave ? 
Then she told me all about the bad place , and I said I wished I was there . 
She got mad then , but I did n't mean no harm . 
All I wanted was to go somewheres ; all I wanted was a change , I war n't particular . 
She said it was wicked to say what I said ; said she would n't say it for the whole world ; she was going to live so as to go to the good place . 
Well , I could n't see no advantage in going where she was going , so I made up my mind I would n't try for it . 
But I never said so , because it would only make trouble , and would n't do no good . 
Now she had got a start , and she went on and told me all about the good place . 
She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing , forever and ever . 
So I did n't think much of it . 
But I never said so . 
I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there , and she said not by a considerable sight . 
I was glad about that , because I wanted him and me to be together . 
Miss Watson she kept pecking at me , and it got tiresome and lonesome . 
By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers , and then everybody was off to bed . 
I went up to my room with a piece of candle , and put it on the table . 
Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful , but it war n't no use . 
I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead . 
The stars were shining , and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful ; and I heard an owl , away off , who-whooing about somebody that was dead , and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die ; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me , and I could n't make out what it was , and so it made the cold shivers run over me . 
Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that 's on its mind and ca n't make itself understood , and so ca n't rest easy in its grave , and has to go about that way every night grieving . 
I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company . 
Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder , and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle ; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up . 
I did n't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck , so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me . 
I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time ; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away . 
But I had n't no confidence . 
You do that when you 've lost a horseshoe that you 've found , instead of nailing it up over the door , but I had n't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you 'd killed a spider . 
I set down again , a-shaking all over , and got out my pipe for a smoke ; for the house was all as still as death now , and so the widow wouldn't know . 
Well , after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom -- boom -- boom -- twelve licks ; and all still again -- stiller than ever . 
Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees -- something was a stirring . 
I set still and listened . 
Directly I could just barely hear a me-yow ! 
me-yow ! 
down there . 
That was good ! 
Says I , me-yow ! 
me-yow ! 
as soft as I could , and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed . 
Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees , and , sure enough , there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me . 
. 
WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow 's garden , stooping down so as the branches would n't scrape our heads . 
When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise . 
We scrouched down and laid still . 
Miss Watson 's big nigger , named Jim , was setting in the kitchen door ; we could see him pretty clear , because there was a light behind him . 
He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute , listening . 
Then he says : Who dah ? 
He listened some more ; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us ; we could a touched him , nearly . 
Well , likely it was minutes and minutes that there war n't a sound , and we all there so close together . 
There was a place on my ankle that got to itching , but I das n't scratch it ; and then my ear begun to itch ; and next my back , right between my shoulders . 
Seemed like I 'd die if I could n't scratch . 
Well , I 've noticed that thing plenty times since . 
If you are with the quality , or at a funeral , or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy -- if you are anywheres where it wo n't do for you to scratch , why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places . 
Pretty soon Jim says : Say , who is you ? 
Whar is you ? 
Dog my cats ef I didn ' hear sumf ' n . 
Well , I know what I 's gwyne to do : I 's gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin . 
So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom . 
He leaned his back up against a tree , and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine . 
My nose begun to itch . 
It itched till the tears come into my eyes . 
But I das n't scratch . 
Then it begun to itch on the inside . 
Next I got to itching underneath . 
I did n't know how I was going to set still . 
This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes ; but it seemed a sight longer than that . 
I was itching in eleven different places now . 
I reckoned I could n't stand it more ' n a minute longer , but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try . 
Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy ; next he begun to snore -- and then I was pretty soon comfortable again . 
Tom he made a sign to me -- kind of a little noise with his mouth -- and we went creeping away on our hands and knees . 
When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me , and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun . 
But I said no ; he might wake and make a disturbance , and then they 'd find out I war n't in . 
Then Tom said he had n't got candles enough , and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more . 
I did n't want him to try . 
I said Jim might wake up and come . 
But Tom wanted to resk it ; so we slid in there and got three candles , and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay . 
Then we got out , and I was in a sweat to get away ; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was , on his hands and knees , and play something on him . 
I waited , and it seemed a good while , everything was so still and lonesome . 
As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path , around the garden fence , and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house . 
Tom said he slipped Jim 's hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him , and Jim stirred a little , but he did n't wake . 
Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance , and rode him all over the State , and then set him under the trees again , and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it . 
And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans ; and , after that , every time he told it he spread it more and more , till by and by he said they rode him all over the world , and tired him most to death , and his back was all over saddle-boils . 
Jim was monstrous proud about it , and he got so he would n't hardly notice the other niggers . 
Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it , and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country . 
Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over , same as if he was a wonder . 
Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire ; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things , Jim would happen in and say , Hm ! 
What you know 'bout witches ? 
and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat . 
Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string , and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands , and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it ; but he never told what it was he said to it . 
Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had , just for a sight of that five-center piece ; but they would n't touch it , because the devil had had his hands on it . 
Jim was most ruined for a servant , because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches . 
Well , when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling , where there was sick folks , maybe ; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine ; and down by the village was the river , a whole mile broad , and awful still and grand . 
We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers , and two or three more of the boys , hid in the old tanyard . 
So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half , to the big scar on the hillside , and went ashore . 
We went to a clump of bushes , and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret , and then showed them a hole in the hill , right in the thickest part of the bushes . 
Then we lit the candles , and crawled in on our hands and knees . 
We went about two hundred yards , and then the cave opened up . 
Tom poked about amongst the passages , and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you would n't a noticed that there was a hole . 
We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room , all damp and sweaty and cold , and there we stopped . 
Tom says : Now , we 'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer 's Gang . 
Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath , and write his name in blood . 
Everybody was willing . 
So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on , and read it . 
It swore every boy to stick to the band , and never tell any of the secrets ; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band , whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it , and he must n't eat and he must n't sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts , which was the sign of the band . 
And nobody that did n't belong to the band could use that mark , and if he did he must be sued ; and if he done it again he must be killed . 
And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets , he must have his throat cut , and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around , and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang , but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever . 
Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath , and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head . 
He said , some of it , but the rest was out of pirate-books and robber-books , and every gang that was high-toned had it . 
Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told the secrets . 
Tom said it was a good idea , so he took a pencil and wrote it in . 
Then Ben Rogers says : Here 's Huck Finn , he hai n't got no family ; what you going to do 'bout him ? 
Well , hai n't he got a father ? 
says Tom Sawyer . 
Yes , he 's got a father , but you ca n't never find him these days . 
He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard , but he hai n't been seen in these parts for a year or more . 
They talked it over , and they was going to rule me out , because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill , or else it would n't be fair and square for the others . 
Well , nobody could think of anything to do -- everybody was stumped , and set still . 
I was most ready to cry ; but all at once I thought of a way , and so I offered them Miss Watson -- they could kill her . 
Everybody said : Oh , she 'll do . 
That 's all right . 
Huck can come in . 
Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with , and I made my mark on the paper . 
Now , says Ben Rogers , what 's the line of business of this Gang ? 
Nothing only robbery and murder , Tom said . 
But who are we going to rob ? -- houses , or cattle , or -- Stuff ! 
stealing cattle and such things ai n't robbery ; it 's burglary , says Tom Sawyer . 
We ai n't burglars . 
That ai n't no sort of style . 
We are highwaymen . 
We stop stages and carriages on the road , with masks on , and kill the people and take their watches and money . 
Must we always kill the people ? 
Oh , certainly . 
It 's best . 
Some authorities think different , but mostly it 's considered best to kill them -- except some that you bring to the cave here , and keep them till they 're ransomed . 
Ransomed ? 
What 's that ? 
I do n't know . 
But that 's what they do . 
I 've seen it in books ; and so of course that 's what we 've got to do . 
But how can we do it if we do n't know what it is ? 
Why , blame it all , we 've _got_ to do it . 
Do n't I tell you it 's in the books ? 
Do you want to go to doing different from what 's in the books , and get things all muddled up ? 
Oh , that 's all very fine to _say_ , Tom Sawyer , but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we do n't know how to do it to them ? -- that 's the thing I want to get at . 
Now , what do you reckon it is ? 
Well , I do n't know . 
But per'aps if we keep them till they 're ransomed , it means that we keep them till they 're dead . 
Now , that 's something _like_ . 
That 'll answer . 
Why could n't you said that before ? 
We 'll keep them till they 're ransomed to death ; and a bothersome lot they 'll be , too -- eating up everything , and always trying to get loose . 
How you talk , Ben Rogers . 
How can they get loose when there 's a guard over them , ready to shoot them down if they move a peg ? 
A guard ! 
Well , that _is_ good . 
So somebody 's got to set up all night and never get any sleep , just so as to watch them . 
I think that's foolishness . 
Why ca n't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here ? 
Because it ai n't in the books so -- that 's why . 
Now , Ben Rogers , do you want to do things regular , or do n't you ? -- that 's the idea . 
Do n't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what 's the correct thing to do ? 
Do you reckon _you_ can learn 'em anything ? 
Not by a good deal . 
No , sir , we 'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way . 
All right . 
I do n't mind ; but I say it 's a fool way , anyhow . 
Say , do we kill the women , too ? 
Well , Ben Rogers , if I was as ignorant as you I would n't let on . 
Kill the women ? 
No ; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that . 
You fetch them to the cave , and you 're always as polite as pie to them ; and by and by they fall in love with you , and never want to go home any more . 
Well , if that 's the way I 'm agreed , but I do n't take no stock in it . 
Mighty soon we 'll have the cave so cluttered up with women , and fellows waiting to be ransomed , that there wo n't be no place for the robbers . 
But go ahead , I ai n't got nothing to say . 
Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now , and when they waked him up he was scared , and cried , and said he wanted to go home to his ma , and didn't want to be a robber any more . 
So they all made fun of him , and called him cry-baby , and that made him mad , and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets . 
But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet , and said we would all go home and meet next week , and rob somebody and kill some people . 
Ben Rogers said he could n't get out much , only Sundays , and so he wanted to begin next Sunday ; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday , and that settled the thing . 
They agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could , and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang , and so started home . 
I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking . 
My new clothes was all greased up and clayey , and I was dog-tired . 
. 
WELL , I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes ; but the widow she did n't scold , but only cleaned off the grease and clay , and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could . 
Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed , but nothing come of it . 
She told me to pray every day , and whatever I asked for I would get it . 
But it war n't so . 
I tried it . 
Once I got a fish-line , but no hooks . 
It war n't any good to me without hooks . 
I tried for the hooks three or four times , but somehow I could n't make it work . 
By and by , one day , I asked Miss Watson to try for me , but she said I was a fool . 
She never told me why , and I could n't make it out no way . 
I set down one time back in the woods , and had a long think about it . 
I says to myself , if a body can get anything they pray for , why don't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork ? 
Why ca n't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole ? 
Why ca n't Miss Watson fat up ? 
No , says I to my self , there ai n't nothing in it . 
I went and told the widow about it , and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was spiritual gifts . 
This was too many for me , but she told me what she meant -- I must help other people , and do everything I could for other people , and look out for them all the time , and never think about myself . 
This was including Miss Watson , as I took it . 
I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time , but I could n't see no advantage about it -- except for the other people ; so at last I reckoned I would n't worry about it any more , but just let it go . 
Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body 's mouth water ; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again . 
I judged I could see that there was two Providences , and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow 's Providence , but if Miss Watson 's got him there war n't no help for him any more . 
I thought it all out , and reckoned I would belong to the widow 's if he wanted me , though I could n't make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before , seeing I was so ignorant , and so kind of low-down and ornery . 
Pap he had n't been seen for more than a year , and that was comfortable for me ; I did n't want to see him no more . 
He used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me ; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around . 
Well , about this time he was found in the river drownded , about twelve mile above town , so people said . 
They judged it was him , anyway ; said this drownded man was just his size , and was ragged , and had uncommon long hair , which was all like pap ; but they could n't make nothing out of the face , because it had been in the water so long it war n't much like a face at all . 
They said he was floating on his back in the water . 
They took him and buried him on the bank . 
But I war n't comfortable long , because I happened to think of something . 
I knowed mighty well that a drownded man do n't float on his back , but on his face . 
So I knowed , then , that this war n't pap , but a woman dressed up in a man 's clothes . 
So I was uncomfortable again . 
I judged the old man would turn up again by and by , though I wished he would n't . 
We played robber now and then about a month , and then I resigned . 
All the boys did . 
We had n't robbed nobody , had n't killed any people , but only just pretended . 
We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market , but we never hived any of them . 
Tom Sawyer called the hogs ingots , and he called the turnips and stuff julery , and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done , and how many people we had killed and marked . 
But I could n't see no profit in it . 
One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick , which he called a slogan ( which was the sign for the Gang to get together ) , and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants , and six hundred camels , and over a thousand sumter mules , all loaded down with di'monds , and they did n't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers , and so we would lay in ambuscade , as he called it , and kill the lot and scoop the things . 
He said we must slick up our swords and guns , and get ready . 
He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it , though they was only lath and broomsticks , and you might scour at them till you rotted , and then they war n't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before . 
I did n't believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs , but I wanted to see the camels and elephants , so I was on hand next day , Saturday , in the ambuscade ; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill . 
But there warn't no Spaniards and A-rabs , and there war n't no camels nor no elephants . 
It war n't anything but a Sunday-school picnic , and only a primer-class at that . 
We busted it up , and chased the children up the hollow ; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam , though Ben Rogers got a rag doll , and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract ; and then the teacher charged in , and made us drop everything and cut . 
I did n't see no di'monds , and I told Tom Sawyer so . 
He said there was loads of them there , anyway ; and he said there was A-rabs there , too , and elephants and things . 
I said , why could n't we see them , then ? 
He said if I war n't so ignorant , but had read a book called Don Quixote , I would know without asking . 
He said it was all done by enchantment . 
He said there was hundreds of soldiers there , and elephants and treasure , and so on , but we had enemies which he called magicians ; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school , just out of spite . 
I said , all right ; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians . 
Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull . 
Why , said he , a magician could call up a lot of genies , and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson . 
They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church . 
Well , I says , s'pose we got some genies to help _us_ -- ca n't we lick the other crowd then ? 
How you going to get them ? 
I do n't know . 
How do _they_ get them ? 
Why , they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring , and then the genies come tearing in , with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the smoke a-rolling , and everything they 're told to do they up and do it . 
They do n't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots , and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it -- or any other man . 
Who makes them tear around so ? 
Why , whoever rubs the lamp or the ring . 
They belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring , and they 've got to do whatever he says . 
If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds , and fill it full of chewing-gum , or whatever you want , and fetch an emperor's daughter from China for you to marry , they 've got to do it -- and they've got to do it before sun-up next morning , too . 
And more : they 've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it , you understand . 
Well , says I , I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping the palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that . 
And what's more -- if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp . 
How you talk , Huck Finn . 
Why , you 'd _have_ to come when he rubbed it , whether you wanted to or not . 
What ! 
and I as high as a tree and as big as a church ? 
All right , then ; I _would_ come ; but I lay I 'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country . 
Shucks , it ai n't no use to talk to you , Huck Finn . 
You do n't seem to know anything , somehow -- perfect saphead . 
I thought all this over for two or three days , and then I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it . 
I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring , and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun , calculating to build a palace and sell it ; but it warn't no use , none of the genies come . 
So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer 's lies . 
I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the elephants , but as for me I think different . 
It had all the marks of a Sunday-school . 
. 
WELL , three or four months run along , and it was well into the winter now . 
I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little , and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five , and I do n't reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever . 
I do n't take no stock in mathematics , anyway . 
At first I hated the school , but by and by I got so I could stand it . 
Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey , and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up . 
So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be . 
I was getting sort of used to the widow 's ways , too , and they war n't so raspy on me . 
Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly , but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes , and so that was a rest to me . 
I liked the old ways best , but I was getting so I liked the new ones , too , a little bit . 
The widow said I was coming along slow but sure , and doing very satisfactory . 
She said she war n't ashamed of me . 
One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast . 
I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck , but Miss Watson was in ahead of me , and crossed me off . 
She says , Take your hands away , Huckleberry ; what a mess you are always making ! 
The widow put in a good word for me , but that war n't going to keep off the bad luck , I knowed that well enough . 
I started out , after breakfast , feeling worried and shaky , and wondering where it was going to fall on me , and what it was going to be . 
There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck , but this was n't one of them kind ; so I never tried to do anything , but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out . 
I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence . 
There was an inch of new snow on the ground , and I seen somebody 's tracks . 
They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while , and then went on around the garden fence . 
It was funny they had n't come in , after standing around so . 
I could n't make it out . 
It was very curious , somehow . 
I was going to follow around , but I stooped down to look at the tracks first . 
I didn't notice anything at first , but next I did . 
There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails , to keep off the devil . 
I was up in a second and shinning down the hill . 
I looked over my shoulder every now and then , but I did n't see nobody . 
I was at Judge Thatcher 's as quick as I could get there . 
He said : Why , my boy , you are all out of breath . 
Did you come for your interest ? 
No , sir , I says ; is there some for me ? 
Oh , yes , a half-yearly is in last night -- over a hundred and fifty dollars . 
Quite a fortune for you . 
You had better let me invest it along with your six thousand , because if you take it you 'll spend it . 
No , sir , I says , I do n't want to spend it . 
I do n't want it at all -- nor the six thousand , nuther . 
I want you to take it ; I want to give it to you -- the six thousand and all . 
He looked surprised . 
He could n't seem to make it out . 
He says : Why , what can you mean , my boy ? 
I says , Do n't you ask me no questions about it , please . 
You 'll take it -- wo n't you ? 
He says : Well , I 'm puzzled . 
Is something the matter ? 
Please take it , says I , and do n't ask me nothing -- then I wo n't have to tell no lies . 
He studied a while , and then he says : Oho-o ! 
I think I see . 
You want to _sell_ all your property to me -- not give it . 
That 's the correct idea . 
Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over , and says : There ; you see it says 'for a consideration . ' 
That means I have bought it of you and paid you for it . 
Here 's a dollar for you . 
Now you sign it . 
So I signed it , and left . 
Miss Watson 's nigger , Jim , had a hair-ball as big as your fist , which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox , and he used to do magic with it . 
He said there was a spirit inside of it , and it knowed everything . 
So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again , for I found his tracks in the snow . 
What I wanted to know was , what he was going to do , and was he going to stay ? 
Jim got out his hair-ball and said something over it , and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor . 
It fell pretty solid , and only rolled about an inch . 
Jim tried it again , and then another time , and it acted just the same . 
Jim got down on his knees , and put his ear against it and listened . 
But it war n't no use ; he said it would n't talk . 
He said sometimes it would n't talk without money . 
I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that war n't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little , and it would n't pass nohow , even if the brass did n't show , because it was so slick it felt greasy , and so that would tell on it every time . 
( I reckoned I would n't say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge . ) 
I said it was pretty bad money , but maybe the hair-ball would take it , because maybe it would n't know the difference . 
Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it , and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good . 
He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night , and next morning you could n't see no brass , and it would n't feel greasy no more , and so anybody in town would take it in a minute , let alone a hair-ball . 
Well , I knowed a potato would do that before , but I had forgot it . 
Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball , and got down and listened again . 
This time he said the hair-ball was all right . 
He said it would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to . 
I says , go on . 
So the hair-ball talked to Jim , and Jim told it to me . 
He says : Yo ' ole father doan ' know yit what he 's a-gwyne to do . 
Sometimes he spec he 'll go 'way , en den agin he spec he 'll stay . 
De bes ' way is to res ' easy en let de ole man take his own way . 
Dey 's two angels hoverin' roun ' 'bout him . 
One uv 'em is white en shiny , en t'other one is black . 
De white one gits him to go right a little while , den de black one sail in en bust it all up . 
A body ca n't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las ' . 
But you is all right . 
You gwyne to have considable trouble in yo ' life , en considable joy . 
Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt , en sometimes you gwyne to git sick ; but every time you 's gwyne to git well agin . 
Dey 's two gals flyin ' 'bout you in yo ' life . 
One uv 'em 's light en t'other one is dark . 
One is rich en t'other is po ' . 
You 's gwyne to marry de po ' one fust en de rich one by en by . 
You wants to keep 'way fum de water as much as you kin , en do n't run no resk , 'kase it 's down in de bills dat you 's gwyne to git hung . 
When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his own self ! 
. 
I had shut the door to . 
Then I turned around and there he was . 
I used to be scared of him all the time , he tanned me so much . 
I reckoned I was scared now , too ; but in a minute I see I was mistaken -- that is , after the first jolt , as you may say , when my breath sort of hitched , he being so unexpected ; but right away after I see I war n't scared of him worth bothring about . 
He was most fifty , and he looked it . 
His hair was long and tangled and greasy , and hung down , and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines . 
It was all black , no gray ; so was his long , mixed-up whiskers . 
There war n't no color in his face , where his face showed ; it was white ; not like another man 's white , but a white to make a body sick , a white to make a body 's flesh crawl -- a tree-toad white , a fish-belly white . 
As for his clothes -- just rags , that was all . 
He had one ankle resting on t'other knee ; the boot on that foot was busted , and two of his toes stuck through , and he worked them now and then . 
His hat was laying on the floor -- an old black slouch with the top caved in , like a lid . 
I stood a-looking at him ; he set there a-looking at me , with his chair tilted back a little . 
I set the candle down . 
I noticed the window was up ; so he had clumb in by the shed . 
He kept a-looking me all over . 
By and by he says : Starchy clothes -- very . 
You think you 're a good deal of a big-bug , _don't_ you ? 
Maybe I am , maybe I ai n't , I says . 
Do n't you give me none o ' your lip , says he . 
You 've put on considerable many frills since I been away . 
I 'll take you down a peg before I get done with you . 
You 're educated , too , they say -- can read and write . 
You think you 're better ' n your father , now , do n't you , because he ca n't ? 
_I'll_ take it out of you . 
Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut ' n foolishness , hey ? -- who told you you could ? 
The widow . 
She told me . 
The widow , hey ? -- and who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ai n't none of her business ? 
Nobody never told her . 
Well , I 'll learn her how to meddle . 
And looky here -- you drop that school , you hear ? 
I 'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better ' n what _he_ is . 
You lem me catch you fooling around that school again , you hear ? 
Your mother could n't read , and she could n't write , nuther , before she died . 
None of the family could n't before _they_ died . 
I ca n't ; and here you're a-swelling yourself up like this . 
I ai n't the man to stand it -- you hear ? 
Say , lem me hear you read . 
I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the wars . 
When I 'd read about a half a minute , he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house . 
He says : It 's so . 
You can do it . 
I had my doubts when you told me . 
Now looky here ; you stop that putting on frills . 
I wo n't have it . 
I 'll lay for you , my smarty ; and if I catch you about that school I 'll tan you good . 
First you know you 'll get religion , too . 
I never see such a son . 
He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy , and says : What 's this ? 
It 's something they give me for learning my lessons good . 
He tore it up , and says : I 'll give you something better -- I 'll give you a cowhide . 
He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute , and then he says : _Ain't_ you a sweet-scented dandy , though ? 
A bed ; and bedclothes ; and a look ' n'-glass ; and a piece of carpet on the floor -- and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard . 
I never see such a son . 
I bet I 'll take some o ' these frills out o ' you before I 'm done with you . 
Why , there ai n't no end to your airs -- they say you 're rich . 
Hey ? -- how's that ? 
They lie -- that 's how . 
Looky here -- mind how you talk to me ; I 'm a-standing about all I can stand now -- so do n't gim me no sass . 
I 've been in town two days , and I hai n't heard nothing but about you bein ' rich . 
I heard about it away down the river , too . 
That 's why I come . 
You git me that money to-morrow -- I want it . 
I hai n't got no money . 
It 's a lie . 
Judge Thatcher 's got it . 
You git it . 
I want it . 
I hai n't got no money , I tell you . 
You ask Judge Thatcher ; he 'll tell you the same . 
All right . 
I 'll ask him ; and I 'll make him pungle , too , or I 'll know the reason why . 
Say , how much you got in your pocket ? 
I want it . 
I hai n't got only a dollar , and I want that to -- It do n't make no difference what you want it for -- you just shell it out . 
He took it and bit it to see if it was good , and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky ; said he had n't had a drink all day . 
When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again , and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him ; and when I reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again , and told me to mind about that school , because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I did n't drop that . 
Next day he was drunk , and he went to Judge Thatcher 's and bullyragged him , and tried to make him give up the money ; but he could n't , and then he swore he 'd make the law force him . 
The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian ; but it was a new judge that had just come , and he did n't know the old man ; so he said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could help it ; said he 'd druther not take a child away from its father . 
So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business . 
That pleased the old man till he could n't rest . 
He said he 'd cowhide me till I was black and blue if I did n't raise some money for him . 
I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher , and pap took it and got drunk , and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on ; and he kept it up all over town , with a tin pan , till most midnight ; then they jailed him , and next day they had him before court , and jailed him again for a week . 
But he said _he_ was satisfied ; said he was boss of his son , and he 'd make it warm for _him_ . 
When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him . 
So he took him to his own house , and dressed him up clean and nice , and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family , and was just old pie to him , so to speak . 
And after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried , and said he 'd been a fool , and fooled away his life ; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody would n't be ashamed of , and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him . 
The judge said he could hug him for them words ; so he cried , and his wife she cried again ; pap said he 'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before , and the judge said he believed it . 
The old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy , and the judge said it was so ; so they cried again . 
And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand , and says : Look at it , gentlemen and ladies all ; take a-hold of it ; shake it . 
There 's a hand that was the hand of a hog ; but it ai n't so no more ; it's the hand of a man that 's started in on a new life , and 'll die before he 'll go back . 
You mark them words -- do n't forget I said them . 
It 's a clean hand now ; shake it -- do n't be afeard . 
So they shook it , one after the other , all around , and cried . 
The judge 's wife she kissed it . 
Then the old man he signed a pledge -- made his mark . 
The judge said it was the holiest time on record , or something like that . 
Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room , which was the spare room , and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod , and clumb back again and had a good old time ; and towards daylight he crawled out again , drunk as a fiddler , and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places , and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up . 
And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it . 
The judge he felt kind of sore . 
He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun , maybe , but he did n't know no other way . 
. 
WELL , pretty soon the old man was up and around again , and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money , and he went for me , too , for not stopping school . 
He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me , but I went to school just the same , and dodged him or outrun him most of the time . 
I did n't want to go to school much before , but I reckoned I 'd go now to spite pap . 
That law trial was a slow business -- appeared like they war n't ever going to get started on it ; so every now and then I 'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him , to keep from getting a cowhiding . 
Every time he got money he got drunk ; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town ; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed . 
He was just suited -- this kind of thing was right in his line . 
He got to hanging around the widow 's too much and so she told him at last that if he did n't quit using around there she would make trouble for him . 
Well , _wasn't_ he mad ? 
He said he would show who was Huck Finn 's boss . 
So he watched out for me one day in the spring , and catched me , and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff , and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you could n't find it if you did n't know where it was . 
He kept me with him all the time , and I never got a chance to run off . 
We lived in that old cabin , and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights . 
He had a gun which he had stole , I reckon , and we fished and hunted , and that was what we lived on . 
Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store , three miles , to the ferry , and traded fish and game for whisky , and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time , and licked me . 
The widow she found out where I was by and by , and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me ; but pap drove him off with the gun , and it war n't long after that till I was used to being where I was , and liked it -- all but the cowhide part . 
It was kind of lazy and jolly , laying off comfortable all day , smoking and fishing , and no books nor study . 
Two months or more run along , and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt , and I did n't see how I 'd ever got to like it so well at the widow 's , where you had to wash , and eat on a plate , and comb up , and go to bed and get up regular , and be forever bothering over a book , and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time . 
I did n't want to go back no more . 
I had stopped cussing , because the widow did n't like it ; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't no objections . 
It was pretty good times up in the woods there , take it all around . 
But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry , and I could n't stand it . 
I was all over welts . 
He got to going away so much , too , and locking me in . 
Once he locked me in and was gone three days . 
It was dreadful lonesome . 
I judged he had got drownded , and I was n't ever going to get out any more . 
I was scared . 
I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there . 
I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time , but I could n't find no way . 
There war n't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through . 
I could n't get up the chimbly ; it was too narrow . 
The door was thick , solid oak slabs . 
Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away ; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times ; well , I was most all the time at it , because it was about the only way to put in the time . 
But this time I found something at last ; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle ; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof . 
I greased it up and went to work . 
There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table , to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out . 
I got under the table and raised the blanket , and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out -- big enough to let me through . 
Well , it was a good long job , but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap 's gun in the woods . 
I got rid of the signs of my work , and dropped the blanket and hid my saw , and pretty soon pap come in . 
Pap war n't in a good humor -- so he was his natural self . 
He said he was down town , and everything was going wrong . 
His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial ; but then there was ways to put it off a long time , and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it . 
And he said people allowed there 'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian , and they guessed it would win this time . 
This shook me up considerable , because I did n't want to go back to the widow 's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized , as they called it . 
Then the old man got to cussing , and cussed everything and everybody he could think of , and then cussed them all over again to make sure he had n't skipped any , and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round , including a considerable parcel of people which he did n't know the names of , and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them , and went right along with his cussing . 
He said he would like to see the widow get me . 
He said he would watch out , and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in , where they might hunt till they dropped and they could n't find me . 
That made me pretty uneasy again , but only for a minute ; I reckoned I would n't stay on hand till he got that chance . 
The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got . 
There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal , and a side of bacon , ammunition , and a four-gallon jug of whisky , and an old book and two newspapers for wadding , besides some tow . 
I toted up a load , and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest . 
I thought it all over , and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines , and take to the woods when I run away . 
I guessed I would n't stay in one place , but just tramp right across the country , mostly night times , and hunt and fish to keep alive , and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow could n't ever find me any more . 
I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough , and I reckoned he would . 
I got so full of it I did n't notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded . 
I got the things all up to the cabin , and then it was about dark . 
While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up , and went to ripping again . 
He had been drunk over in town , and laid in the gutter all night , and he was a sight to look at . 
A body would a thought he was Adam -- he was just all mud . 
Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment , this time he says : Call this a govment ! 
why , just look at it and see what it 's like . 
Here 's the law a-standing ready to take a man 's son away from him -- a man 's own son , which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising . 
Yes , just as that man has got that son raised at last , and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin ' for _him_ and give him a rest , the law up and goes for him . 
And they call _that_ govment ! 
That ai n't all , nuther . 
The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o ' my property . 
Here 's what the law does : The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up'ards , and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this , and lets him go round in clothes that ai n't fitten for a hog . 
They call that govment ! 
A man ca n't get his rights in a govment like this . 
Sometimes I 've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all . 
Yes , and I _told_ 'em so ; I told old Thatcher so to his face . 
Lots of 'em heard me , and can tell what I said . 
Says I , for two cents I 'd leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin . 
Them 's the very words . 
I says look at my hat -- if you call it a hat -- but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it 's below my chin , and then it ai n't rightly a hat at all , but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o' stove-pipe . 
Look at it , says I -- such a hat for me to wear -- one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights . 
Oh , yes , this is a wonderful govment , wonderful . 
Why , looky here . 
There was a free nigger there from Ohio -- a mulatter , most as white as a white man . 
He had the whitest shirt on you ever see , too , and the shiniest hat ; and there ai n't a man in that town that 's got as fine clothes as what he had ; and he had a gold watch and chain , and a silver-headed cane -- the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State . 
And what do you think ? 
They said he was a p'fessor in a college , and could talk all kinds of languages , and knowed everything . 
And that ai n't the wust . 
They said he could _vote_ when he was at home . 
Well , that let me out . 
Thinks I , what is the country a-coming to ? 
It was 'lection day , and I was just about to go and vote myself if I war n't too drunk to get there ; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they 'd let that nigger vote , I drawed out . 
I says I 'll never vote agin . 
Them 's the very words I said ; they all heard me ; and the country may rot for all me -- I 'll never vote agin as long as I live . 
And to see the cool way of that nigger -- why , he would n't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o ' the way . 
I says to the people , why ai n't this nigger put up at auction and sold ? -- that 's what I want to know . 
And what do you reckon they said ? 
Why , they said he could n't be sold till he 'd been in the State six months , and he had n't been there that long yet . 
There , now -- that 's a specimen . 
They call that a govment that ca n't sell a free nigger till he 's been in the State six months . 
Here 's a govment that calls itself a govment , and lets on to be a govment , and thinks it is a govment , and yet 's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling , thieving , infernal , white-shirted free nigger , and -- Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to , so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins , and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language -- mostly hove at the nigger and the govment , though he give the tub some , too , all along , here and there . 
He hopped around the cabin considerable , first on one leg and then on the other , holding first one shin and then the other one , and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick . 
But it war n't good judgment , because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it ; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body 's hair raise , and down he went in the dirt , and rolled there , and held his toes ; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous . 
He said so his own self afterwards . 
He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days , and he said it laid over him , too ; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on , maybe . 
After supper pap took the jug , and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens . 
That was always his word . 
I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour , and then I would steal the key , or saw myself out , one or t'other . 
He drank and drank , and tumbled down on his blankets by and by ; but luck did n't run my way . 
He did n't go sound asleep , but was uneasy . 
He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time . 
At last I got so sleepy I could n't keep my eyes open all I could do , and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep , and the candle burning . 
I do n't know how long I was asleep , but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up . 
There was pap looking wild , and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes . 
He said they was crawling up his legs ; and then he would give a jump and scream , and say one had bit him on the cheek -- but I could n't see no snakes . 
He started and run round and round the cabin , hollering Take him off ! 
take him off ! 
he 's biting me on the neck ! 
I never see a man look so wild in the eyes . 
Pretty soon he was all fagged out , and fell down panting ; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast , kicking things every which way , and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands , and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him . 
He wore out by and by , and laid still a while , moaning . 
Then he laid stiller , and did n't make a sound . 
I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods , and it seemed terrible still . 
He was laying over by the corner . 
By and by he raised up part way and listened , with his head to one side . 
He says , very low : Tramp -- tramp -- tramp ; that 's the dead ; tramp -- tramp -- tramp ; they 're coming after me ; but I wo n't go . 
Oh , they 're here ! 
do n't touch me -- do n't ! 
hands off -- they 're cold ; let go . 
Oh , let a poor devil alone ! 
Then he went down on all fours and crawled off , begging them to let him alone , and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table , still a-begging ; and then he went to crying . 
I could hear him through the blanket . 
By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild , and he see me and went for me . 
He chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife , calling me the Angel of Death , and saying he would kill me , and then I could n't come for him no more . 
I begged , and told him I was only Huck ; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh , and roared and cussed , and kept on chasing me up . 
Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders , and I thought I was gone ; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning , and saved myself . 
Pretty soon he was all tired out , and dropped down with his back against the door , and said he would rest a minute and then kill me . 
He put his knife under him , and said he would sleep and get strong , and then he would see who was who . 
So he dozed off pretty soon . 
By and by I got the old split-bottom chair and clumb up as easy as I could , not to make any noise , and got down the gun . 
I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded , then I laid it across the turnip barrel , pointing towards pap , and set down behind it to wait for him to stir . 
And how slow and still the time did drag along . 
. 
GIT up ! 
What you 'bout ? 
I opened my eyes and looked around , trying to make out where I was . 
It was after sun-up , and I had been sound asleep . 
Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick , too . 
He says : What you doin ' with this gun ? 
I judged he did n't know nothing about what he had been doing , so I says : Somebody tried to get in , so I was laying for him . 
Why did n't you roust me out ? 
Well , I tried to , but I could n't ; I could n't budge you . 
Well , all right . 
Do n't stand there palavering all day , but out with you and see if there 's a fish on the lines for breakfast . 
I 'll be along in a minute . 
He unlocked the door , and I cleared out up the river-bank . 
I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down , and a sprinkling of bark ; so I knowed the river had begun to rise . 
I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town . 
The June rise used to be always luck for me ; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down , and pieces of log rafts -- sometimes a dozen logs together ; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill . 
I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out for what the rise might fetch along . 
Well , all at once here comes a canoe ; just a beauty , too , about thirteen or fourteen foot long , riding high like a duck . 
I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog , clothes and all on , and struck out for the canoe . 
I just expected there 'd be somebody laying down in it , because people often done that to fool folks , and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up and laugh at him . 
But it war n't so this time . 
It was a drift-canoe sure enough , and I clumb in and paddled her ashore . 
Thinks I , the old man will be glad when he sees this -- she 's worth ten dollars . 
But when I got to shore pap was n't in sight yet , and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully , all hung over with vines and willows , I struck another idea : I judged I 'd hide her good , and then , 'stead of taking to the woods when I run off , I 'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good , and not have such a rough time tramping on foot . 
It was pretty close to the shanty , and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time ; but I got her hid ; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows , and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun . 
So he had n't seen anything . 
When he got along I was hard at it taking up a trot line . 
He abused me a little for being so slow ; but I told him I fell in the river , and that was what made me so long . 
I knowed he would see I was wet , and then he would be asking questions . 
We got five catfish off the lines and went home . 
While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up , both of us being about wore out , I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me , it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me ; you see , all kinds of things might happen . 
Well , I did n't see no way for a while , but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water , and he says : Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out , you hear ? 
That man war n't here for no good . 
I 'd a shot him . 
Next time you roust me out , you hear ? 
Then he dropped down and went to sleep again ; but what he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted . 
I says to myself , I can fix it now so nobody wo n't think of following me . 
About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank . 
The river was coming up pretty fast , and lots of driftwood going by on the rise . 
By and by along comes part of a log raft -- nine logs fast together . 
We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore . 
Then we had dinner . 
Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through , so as to catch more stuff ; but that war n't pap 's style . 
Nine logs was enough for one time ; he must shove right over to town and sell . 
So he locked me in and took the skiff , and started off towing the raft about half-past three . 
I judged he would n't come back that night . 
I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start ; then I out with my saw , and went to work on that log again . 
Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the hole ; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder . 
I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid , and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in ; then I done the same with the side of bacon ; then the whisky-jug . 
I took all the coffee and sugar there was , and all the ammunition ; I took the wadding ; I took the bucket and gourd ; I took a dipper and a tin cup , and my old saw and two blankets , and the skillet and the coffee-pot . 
I took fish-lines and matches and other things -- everything that was worth a cent . 
I cleaned out the place . 
I wanted an axe , but there was n't any , only the one out at the woodpile , and I knowed why I was going to leave that . 
I fetched out the gun , and now I was done . 
I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things . 
So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place , which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust . 
Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place , and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there , for it was bent up at that place and did n't quite touch ground . 
If you stood four or five foot away and did n't know it was sawed , you would n't never notice it ; and besides , this was the back of the cabin , and it war n't likely anybody would go fooling around there . 
It was all grass clear to the canoe , so I had n't left a track . 
I followed around to see . 
I stood on the bank and looked out over the river . 
All safe . 
So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods , and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig ; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms . 
I shot this fellow and took him into camp . 
I took the axe and smashed in the door . 
I beat it and hacked it considerable a-doing it . 
I fetched the pig in , and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe , and laid him down on the ground to bleed ; I say ground because it was ground -- hard packed , and no boards . 
Well , next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it -- all I could drag -- and I started it from the pig , and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in , and down it sunk , out of sight . 
You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground . 
I did wish Tom Sawyer was there ; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business , and throw in the fancy touches . 
Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that . 
Well , last I pulled out some of my hair , and blooded the axe good , and stuck it on the back side , and slung the axe in the corner . 
Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket ( so he couldn't drip ) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river . 
Now I thought of something else . 
So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe , and fetched them to the house . 
I took the bag to where it used to stand , and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw , for there war n't no knives and forks on the place -- pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking . 
Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house , to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes -- and ducks too , you might say , in the season . 
There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away , I do n't know where , but it did n't go to the river . 
The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake . 
I dropped pap 's whetstone there too , so as to look like it had been done by accident . 
Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string , so it would n't leak no more , and took it and my saw to the canoe again . 
It was about dark now ; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank , and waited for the moon to rise . 
I made fast to a willow ; then I took a bite to eat , and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan . 
I says to myself , they 'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me . 
And they 'll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things . 
They wo n't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass . 
They 'll soon get tired of that , and won't bother no more about me . 
All right ; I can stop anywhere I want to . 
Jackson 's Island is good enough for me ; I know that island pretty well , and nobody ever comes there . 
And then I can paddle over to town nights , and slink around and pick up things I want . 
Jackson 's Island 's the place . 
I was pretty tired , and the first thing I knowed I was asleep . 
When I woke up I did n't know where I was for a minute . 
I set up and looked around , a little scared . 
Then I remembered . 
The river looked miles and miles across . 
The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along , black and still , hundreds of yards out from shore . 
Everything was dead quiet , and it looked late , and _smelt_ late . 
You know what I mean -- I do n't know the words to put it in . 
I took a good gap and a stretch , and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water . 
I listened . 
Pretty soon I made it out . 
It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it 's a still night . 
I peeped out through the willow branches , and there it was -- a skiff , away across the water . 
I could n't tell how many was in it . 
It kept a-coming , and when it was abreast of me I see there war n't but one man in it . 
Think 's I , maybe it 's pap , though I war n't expecting him . 
He dropped below me with the current , and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water , and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him . 
Well , it _was_ pap , sure enough -- and sober , too , by the way he laid his oars . 
I did n't lose no time . 
The next minute I was a-spinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank . 
I made two mile and a half , and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river , because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing , and people might see me and hail me . 
I got out amongst the driftwood , and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float . 
I laid there , and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe , looking away into the sky ; not a cloud in it . 
The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine ; I never knowed it before . 
And how far a body can hear on the water such nights ! 
I heard people talking at the ferry landing . 
I heard what they said , too -- every word of it . 
One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now . 
T'other one said _this_ war n't one of the short ones , he reckoned -- and then they laughed , and he said it over again , and they laughed again ; then they waked up another fellow and told him , and laughed , but he did n't laugh ; he ripped out something brisk , and said let him alone . 
The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old woman -- she would think it was pretty good ; but he said that warn't nothing to some things he had said in his time . 
I heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock , and he hoped daylight would n't wait more than about a week longer . 
After that the talk got further and further away , and I could n't make out the words any more ; but I could hear the mumble , and now and then a laugh , too , but it seemed a long ways off . 
I was away below the ferry now . 
I rose up , and there was Jackson's Island , about two mile and a half down stream , heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river , big and dark and solid , like a steamboat without any lights . 
There war n't any signs of the bar at the head -- it was all under water now . 
It did n't take me long to get there . 
I shot past the head at a ripping rate , the current was so swift , and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore . 
I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about ; I had to part the willow branches to get in ; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside . 
I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island , and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town , three mile away , where there was three or four lights twinkling . 
A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream , coming along down , with a lantern in the middle of it . 
I watched it come creeping down , and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say , Stern oars , there ! 
heave her head to stabboard ! 
I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side . 
There was a little gray in the sky now ; so I stepped into the woods , and laid down for a nap before breakfast . 
. 
THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o'clock . 
I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things , and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied . 
I could see the sun out at one or two holes , but mostly it was big trees all about , and gloomy in there amongst them . 
There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves , and the freckled places swapped about a little , showing there was a little breeze up there . 
A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly . 
I was powerful lazy and comfortable -- did n't want to get up and cook breakfast . 
Well , I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of boom ! 
away up the river . 
I rouses up , and rests on my elbow and listens ; pretty soon I hears it again . 
I hopped up , and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves , and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up -- about abreast the ferry . 
And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down . 
I knowed what was the matter now . 
Boom ! 
I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's side . 
You see , they was firing cannon over the water , trying to make my carcass come to the top . 
I was pretty hungry , but it war n't going to do for me to start a fire , because they might see the smoke . 
So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom . 
The river was a mile wide there , and it always looks pretty on a summer morning -- so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat . 
Well , then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off , because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there . 
So , says I , I 'll keep a lookout , and if any of them 's floating around after me I 'll give them a show . 
I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have , and I war n't disappointed . 
A big double loaf come along , and I most got it with a long stick , but my foot slipped and she floated out further . 
Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore -- I knowed enough for that . 
But by and by along comes another one , and this time I won . 
I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver , and set my teeth in . 
It was baker 's bread -- what the quality eat ; none of your low-down corn-pone . 
I got a good place amongst the leaves , and set there on a log , munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat , and very well satisfied . 
And then something struck me . 
I says , now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me , and here it has gone and done it . 
So there ai n't no doubt but there is something in that thing -- that is , there 's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays , but it do n't work for me , and I reckon it do n't work for only just the right kind . 
I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke , and went on watching . 
The ferryboat was floating with the current , and I allowed I 'd have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along , because she would come in close , where the bread did . 
When she 'd got pretty well along down towards me , I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread , and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place . 
Where the log forked I could peep through . 
By and by she come along , and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore . 
Most everybody was on the boat . 
Pap , and Judge Thatcher , and Bessie Thatcher , and Jo Harper , and Tom Sawyer , and his old Aunt Polly , and Sid and Mary , and plenty more . 
Everybody was talking about the murder , but the captain broke in and says : Look sharp , now ; the current sets in the closest here , and maybe he's washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water 's edge . 
I hope so , anyway . 
I did n't hope so . 
They all crowded up and leaned over the rails , nearly in my face , and kept still , watching with all their might . 
I could see them first-rate , but they could n't see me . 
Then the captain sung out : Stand away ! 
and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke , and I judged I was gone . 
If they 'd a had some bullets in , I reckon they'd a got the corpse they was after . 
Well , I see I war n't hurt , thanks to goodness . 
The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island . 
I could hear the booming now and then , further and further off , and by and by , after an hour , I did n't hear it no more . 
The island was three mile long . 
I judged they had got to the foot , and was giving it up . 
But they did n't yet a while . 
They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side , under steam , and booming once in a while as they went . 
I crossed over to that side and watched them . 
When they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town . 
I knowed I was all right now . 
Nobody else would come a-hunting after me . 
I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods . 
I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain could n't get at them . 
I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw , and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper . 
Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast . 
When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking , and feeling pretty well satisfied ; but by and by it got sort of lonesome , and so I went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along , and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down , and then went to bed ; there ai n't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome ; you ca n't stay so , you soon get over it . 
And so for three days and nights . 
No difference -- just the same thing . 
But the next day I went exploring around down through the island . 
I was boss of it ; it all belonged to me , so to say , and I wanted to know all about it ; but mainly I wanted to put in the time . 
I found plenty strawberries , ripe and prime ; and green summer grapes , and green razberries ; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show . 
They would all come handy by and by , I judged . 
Well , I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't far from the foot of the island . 
I had my gun along , but I had n't shot nothing ; it was for protection ; thought I would kill some game nigh home . 
About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake , and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers , and I after it , trying to get a shot at it . 
I clipped along , and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking . 
My heart jumped up amongst my lungs . 
I never waited for to look further , but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could . 
Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened , but my breath come so hard I could n't hear nothing else . 
I slunk along another piece further , then listened again ; and so on , and so on . 
If I see a stump , I took it for a man ; if I trod on a stick and broke it , it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half , and the short half , too . 
When I got to camp I war n't feeling very brash , there war n't much sand in my craw ; but I says , this ai n't no time to be fooling around . 
So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight , and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year 's camp , and then clumb a tree . 
I reckon I was up in the tree two hours ; but I did n't see nothing , I did n't hear nothing -- I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a thousand things . 
Well , I could n't stay up there forever ; so at last I got down , but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time . 
All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast . 
By the time it was night I was pretty hungry . 
So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank -- about a quarter of a mile . 
I went out in the woods and cooked a supper , and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk , plunkety-plunk_ , and says to myself , horses coming ; and next I hear people 's voices . 
I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could , and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out . 
I had n't got far when I hear a man say : We better camp here if we can find a good place ; the horses is about beat out . 
Let 's look around . 
I did n't wait , but shoved out and paddled away easy . 
I tied up in the old place , and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe . 
I did n't sleep much . 
I could n't , somehow , for thinking . 
And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck . 
So the sleep didn't do me no good . 
By and by I says to myself , I ca n't live this way ; I'm a-going to find out who it is that 's here on the island with me ; I'll find it out or bust . 
Well , I felt better right off . 
So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two , and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows . 
The moon was shining , and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day . 
I poked along well on to an hour , everything still as rocks and sound asleep . 
Well , by this time I was most down to the foot of the island . 
A little ripply , cool breeze begun to blow , and that was as good as saying the night was about done . 
I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore ; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods . 
I sat down there on a log , and looked out through the leaves . 
I see the moon go off watch , and the darkness begin to blanket the river . 
But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops , and knowed the day was coming . 
So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire , stopping every minute or two to listen . 
But I had n't no luck somehow ; I could n't seem to find the place . 
But by and by , sure enough , I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees . 
I went for it , cautious and slow . 
By and by I was close enough to have a look , and there laid a man on the ground . 
It most give me the fan-tods . 
He had a blanket around his head , and his head was nearly in the fire . 
I set there behind a clump of bushes , in about six foot of him , and kept my eyes on him steady . 
It was getting gray daylight now . 
Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket , and it was Miss Watson 's Jim ! 
I bet I was glad to see him . 
I says : Hello , Jim ! 
and skipped out . 
He bounced up and stared at me wild . 
Then he drops down on his knees , and puts his hands together and says : Doan ' hurt me -- do n't ! 
I hai n't ever done no harm to a ghos ' . 
I alwuz liked dead people , en done all I could for 'em . 
You go en git in de river agin , whah you b'longs , en doan ' do nuffn to Ole Jim , 'at 'uz awluz yo ' fren ' . 
Well , I war n't long making him understand I war n't dead . 
I was ever so glad to see Jim . 
I war n't lonesome now . 
I told him I war n't afraid of _him_ telling the people where I was . 
I talked along , but he only set there and looked at me ; never said nothing . 
Then I says : It 's good daylight . 
Le 's get breakfast . 
Make up your camp fire good . 
What 's de use er makin ' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck ? 
But you got a gun , hai n't you ? 
Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries . 
Strawberries and such truck , I says . 
Is that what you live on ? 
I couldn ' git nuffn else , he says . 
Why , how long you been on the island , Jim ? 
I come heah de night arter you 's killed . 
What , all that time ? 
Yes -- indeedy . 
And ai n't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat ? 
No , sah -- nuffn else . 
Well , you must be most starved , ai n't you ? 
I reck ' n I could eat a hoss . 
I think I could . 
How long you ben on de islan ' ? 
Since the night I got killed . 
No ! 
W ' y , what has you lived on ? 
But you got a gun . 
Oh , yes , you got a gun . 
Dat 's good . 
Now you kill sumfn en I 'll make up de fire . 
So we went over to where the canoe was , and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees , I fetched meal and bacon and coffee , and coffee-pot and frying-pan , and sugar and tin cups , and the nigger was set back considerable , because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft . 
I catched a good big catfish , too , and Jim cleaned him with his knife , and fried him . 
When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot . 
Jim laid it in with all his might , for he was most about starved . 
Then when we had got pretty well stuffed , we laid off and lazied . 
By and by Jim says : But looky here , Huck , who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it war n't you ? 
Then I told him the whole thing , and he said it was smart . 
He said Tom Sawyer could n't get up no better plan than what I had . 
Then I says : How do you come to be here , Jim , and how 'd you get here ? 
He looked pretty uneasy , and did n't say nothing for a minute . 
Then he says : Maybe I better not tell . 
Why , Jim ? 
Well , dey 's reasons . 
But you wouldn ' tell on me ef I uz to tell you , would you , Huck ? 
Blamed if I would , Jim . 
Well , I b'lieve you , Huck . 
I -- _I run off_ . 
Jim ! 
But mind , you said you wouldn ' tell -- you know you said you wouldn ' tell , Huck . 
Well , I did . 
I said I would n't , and I 'll stick to it . 
Honest _injun_ , I will . 
People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum -- but that do n't make no difference . 
I ai n't a-going to tell , and I ai n't a-going back there , anyways . 
So , now , le 's know all about it . 
Well , you see , it 'uz dis way . 
Ole missus -- dat 's Miss Watson -- she pecks on me all de time , en treats me pooty rough , but she awluz said she wouldn ' sell me down to Orleans . 
But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun ' de place considable lately , en I begin to git oneasy . 
Well , one night I creeps to de do ' pooty late , en de do ' war n't quite shet , en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans , but she didn ' want to , but she could git eight hund 'd dollars for me , en it 'uz sich a big stack o ' money she couldn ' resis ' . 
De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn ' do it , but I never waited to hear de res ' . 
I lit out mighty quick , I tell you . 
I tuck out en shin down de hill , en 'spec to steal a skift 'long de sho ' som'ers 'bove de town , but dey wuz people a-stirring yit , so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go 'way . 
Well , I wuz dah all night . 
Dey wuz somebody roun ' all de time . 
'Long 'bout six in de mawnin ' skifts begin to go by , en 'bout eight er nine every skift dat went 'long wuz talkin ' 'bout how yo ' pap come over to de town en say you 's killed . 
Dese las ' skifts wuz full o ' ladies en genlmen a-goin ' over for to see de place . 
Sometimes dey 'd pull up at de sho ' en take a res ' b'fo ' dey started acrost , so by de talk I got to know all 'bout de killin ' . 
I 'uz powerful sorry you 's killed , Huck , but I ai n't no mo ' now . 
I laid dah under de shavin 's all day . 
I 'uz hungry , but I warn't afeard ; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin ' to start to de camp-meet ' n ' right arter breakfas ' en be gone all day , en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight , so dey wouldn ' 'spec to see me roun ' de place , en so dey wouldn ' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin ' . 
De yuther servants wouldn ' miss me , kase dey 'd shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks 'uz out ' n de way . 
Well , when it come dark I tuck out up de river road , en went 'bout two mile er more to whah dey war n't no houses . 
I 'd made up my mine 'bout what I 's agwyne to do . 
You see , ef I kep ' on tryin ' to git away afoot , de dogs 'ud track me ; ef I stole a skift to cross over , dey 'd miss dat skift , you see , en dey 'd know 'bout whah I 'd lan ' on de yuther side , en whah to pick up my track . 
So I says , a raff is what I 's arter ; it doan' _make_ no track . 
I see a light a-comin ' roun ' de p'int bymeby , so I wade ' in en shove' a log ahead o ' me en swum more ' n half way acrost de river , en got in 'mongst de drift-wood , en kep ' my head down low , en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along . 
Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt . 
It clouded up en 'uz pooty dark for a little while . 
So I clumb up en laid down on de planks . 
De men 'uz all 'way yonder in de middle , whah de lantern wuz . 
De river wuz a-risin ' , en dey wuz a good current ; so I reck ' n 'd 'at by fo ' in de mawnin ' I 'd be twenty-five mile down de river , en den I 'd slip in jis b'fo ' daylight en swim asho ' , en take to de woods on de Illinois side . 
But I didn ' have no luck . 
When we 'uz mos ' down to de head er de islan ' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern , I see it war n't no use fer to wait , so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan ' . 
Well , I had a notion I could lan ' mos ' anywhers , but I could n't -- bank too bluff . 
I 'uz mos ' to de foot er de islan ' b'fo ' I found ' a good place . 
I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn ' fool wid raffs no mo ' , long as dey move de lantern roun ' so . 
I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg , en some matches in my cap , en dey war n't wet , so I 'uz all right . 
And so you ai n't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time ? 
Why did n't you get mud-turkles ? 
How you gwyne to git 'm ? 
You ca n't slip up on um en grab um ; en how's a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock ? 
How could a body do it in de night ? 
En I war n't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime . 
Well , that 's so . 
You 've had to keep in the woods all the time , of course . 
Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon ? 
Oh , yes . 
I knowed dey was arter you . 
I see um go by heah -- watched um thoo de bushes . 
Some young birds come along , flying a yard or two at a time and lighting . 
Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain . 
He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way , and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it . 
I was going to catch some of them , but Jim would n't let me . 
He said it was death . 
He said his father laid mighty sick once , and some of them catched a bird , and his old granny said his father would die , and he did . 
And Jim said you must n't count the things you are going to cook for dinner , because that would bring bad luck . 
The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown . 
And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died , the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning , or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die . 
Jim said bees would n't sting idiots ; but I did n't believe that , because I had tried them lots of times myself , and they would n't sting me . 
I had heard about some of these things before , but not all of them . 
Jim knowed all kinds of signs . 
He said he knowed most everything . 
I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck , and so I asked him if there war n't any good-luck signs . 
He says : Mighty few -- an ' _dey_ ai n't no use to a body . 
What you want to know when good luck 's a-comin ' for ? 
Want to keep it off ? 
And he said : Ef you 's got hairy arms en a hairy breas ' , it 's a sign dat you 's agwyne to be rich . 
Well , dey 's some use in a sign like dat , 'kase it 's so fur ahead . 
You see , maybe you 's got to be po ' a long time fust , en so you might git discourage ' en kill yo'sef ' f you didn ' know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby . 
Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast , Jim ? 
What 's de use to ax dat question ? 
Do n't you see I has ? 
Well , are you rich ? 
No , but I ben rich wunst , and gwyne to be rich agin . 
Wunst I had foteen dollars , but I tuck to specalat ' n ' , en got busted out . 
What did you speculate in , Jim ? 
Well , fust I tackled stock . 
What kind of stock ? 
Why , live stock -- cattle , you know . 
I put ten dollars in a cow . 
But I ain ' gwyne to resk no mo ' money in stock . 
De cow up ' n ' died on my han 's . 
So you lost the ten dollars . 
No , I did n't lose it all . 
I on ' y los ' 'bout nine of it . 
I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents . 
You had five dollars and ten cents left . 
Did you speculate any more ? 
Yes . 
You know that one-laigged nigger dat b'longs to old Misto Bradish ? 
Well , he sot up a bank , en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo ' dollars mo ' at de en ' er de year . 
Well , all de niggers went in , but dey did n't have much . 
I wuz de on ' y one dat had much . 
So I stuck out for mo ' dan fo ' dollars , en I said ' f I didn ' git it I'd start a bank mysef . 
Well , o ' course dat nigger want ' to keep me out er de business , bekase he says dey war n't business 'nough for two banks , so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en' er de year . 
So I done it . 
Den I reck ' n 'd I 'd inves ' de thirty-five dollars right off en keep things a-movin ' . 
Dey wuz a nigger name ' Bob , dat had ketched a wood-flat , en his marster didn ' know it ; en I bought it off ' n him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en ' er de year come ; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night , en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank 's busted . 
So dey didn ' none uv us git no money . 
What did you do with the ten cents , Jim ? 
Well , I 'uz gwyne to spen ' it , but I had a dream , en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name ' Balum -- Balum 's Ass dey call him for short ; he 's one er dem chuckleheads , you know . 
But he 's lucky , dey say , en I see I war n't lucky . 
De dream say let Balum inves ' de ten cents en he'd make a raise for me . 
Well , Balum he tuck de money , en when he wuz in church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po ' len ' to de Lord , en boun ' to git his money back a hund 'd times . 
So Balum he tuck en give de ten cents to de po ' , en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of it . 
Well , what did come of it , Jim ? 
Nuffn never come of it . 
I couldn ' manage to k'leck dat money no way ; en Balum he couldn ' . 
I ain ' gwyne to len ' no mo ' money 'dout I see de security . 
Boun ' to git yo ' money back a hund 'd times , de preacher says ! 
Ef I could git de ten _cents_ back , I 'd call it squah , en be glad er de chanst . 
Well , it 's all right anyway , Jim , long as you 're going to be rich again some time or other . 
Yes ; en I 's rich now , come to look at it . 
I owns mysef , en I 's wuth eight hund 'd dollars . 
I wisht I had de money , I wouldn ' want no mo ' . 
. 
I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that I 'd found when I was exploring ; so we started and soon got to it , because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide . 
This place was a tolerable long , steep hill or ridge about forty foot high . 
We had a rough time getting to the top , the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick . 
We tramped and clumb around all over it , and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock , most up to the top on the side towards Illinois . 
The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together , and Jim could stand up straight in it . 
It was cool in there . 
Jim was for putting our traps in there right away , but I said we did n't want to be climbing up and down there all the time . 
Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place , and had all the traps in the cavern , we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island , and they would never find us without dogs . 
And , besides , he said them little birds had said it was going to rain , and did I want the things to get wet ? 
So we went back and got the canoe , and paddled up abreast the cavern , and lugged all the traps up there . 
Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in , amongst the thick willows . 
We took some fish off of the lines and set them again , and begun to get ready for dinner . 
The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in , and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit , and was flat and a good place to build a fire on . 
So we built it there and cooked dinner . 
We spread the blankets inside for a carpet , and eat our dinner in there . 
We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern . 
Pretty soon it darkened up , and begun to thunder and lighten ; so the birds was right about it . 
Directly it begun to rain , and it rained like all fury , too , and I never see the wind blow so . 
It was one of these regular summer storms . 
It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside , and lovely ; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby ; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves ; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild ; and next , when it was just about the bluest and blackest -- _FST_ ! 
it was as bright as glory , and you 'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm , hundreds of yards further than you could see before ; dark as sin again in a second , and now you 'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash , and then go rumbling , grumbling , tumbling , down the sky towards the under side of the world , like rolling empty barrels down stairs -- where it 's long stairs and they bounce a good deal , you know . 
Jim , this is nice , I says . 
I would n't want to be nowhere else but here . 
Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread . 
Well , you would n't a ben here ' f it had n't a ben for Jim . 
You 'd a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner , en gittn ' mos ' drownded , too ; dat you would , honey . 
Chickens knows when it 's gwyne to rain , en so do de birds , chile . 
The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days , till at last it was over the banks . 
The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom . 
On that side it was a good many miles wide , but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across -- a half a mile -- because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs . 
Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe , It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods , even if the sun was blazing outside . 
We went winding in and out amongst the trees , and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way . 
Well , on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things ; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame , on account of being hungry , that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to ; but not the snakes and turtles -- they would slide off in the water . 
The ridge our cavern was in was full of them . 
We could a had pets enough if we 'd wanted them . 
One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft -- nice pine planks . 
It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long , and the top stood above water six or seven inches -- a solid , level floor . 
We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes , but we let them go ; we did n't show ourselves in daylight . 
Another night when we was up at the head of the island , just before daylight , here comes a frame-house down , on the west side . 
She was a two-story , and tilted over considerable . 
We paddled out and got aboard -- clumb in at an upstairs window . 
But it was too dark to see yet , so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight . 
The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island . 
Then we looked in at the window . 
We could make out a bed , and a table , and two old chairs , and lots of things around about on the floor , and there was clothes hanging against the wall . 
There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man . 
So Jim says : Hello , you ! 
But it did n't budge . 
So I hollered again , and then Jim says : De man ai n't asleep -- he 's dead . 
You hold still -- I 'll go en see . 
He went , and bent down and looked , and says : It 's a dead man . 
Yes , indeedy ; naked , too . 
He 's ben shot in de back . 
I reck ' n he 's ben dead two er three days . 
Come in , Huck , but doan ' look at his face -- it 's too gashly . 
I did n't look at him at all . 
Jim throwed some old rags over him , but he need n't done it ; I did n't want to see him . 
There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor , and old whisky bottles , and a couple of masks made out of black cloth ; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal . 
There was two old dirty calico dresses , and a sun-bonnet , and some women 's underclothes hanging against the wall , and some men 's clothing , too . 
We put the lot into the canoe -- it might come good . 
There was a boy 's old speckled straw hat on the floor ; I took that , too . 
And there was a bottle that had had milk in it , and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck . 
We would a took the bottle , but it was broke . 
There was a seedy old chest , and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke . 
They stood open , but there war n't nothing left in them that was any account . 
The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry , and war n't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff . 
We got an old tin lantern , and a butcher-knife without any handle , and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store , and a lot of tallow candles , and a tin candlestick , and a gourd , and a tin cup , and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed , and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it , and a hatchet and some nails , and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it , and a roll of buckskin , and a leather dog-collar , and a horseshoe , and some vials of medicine that did n't have no label on them ; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb , and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow , and a wooden leg . 
The straps was broke off of it , but , barring that , it was a good enough leg , though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim , and we could n't find the other one , though we hunted all around . 
And so , take it all around , we made a good haul . 
When we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island , and it was pretty broad day ; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt , because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off . 
I paddled over to the Illinois shore , and drifted down most a half a mile doing it . 
I crept up the dead water under the bank , and had n't no accidents and did n't see nobody . 
We got home all safe . 
. 
AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed , but Jim did n't want to . 
He said it would fetch bad luck ; and besides , he said , he might come and ha'nt us ; he said a man that war n't buried was more likely to go a-ha'nting around than one that was planted and comfortable . 
That sounded pretty reasonable , so I did n't say no more ; but I could n't keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man , and what they done it for . 
We rummaged the clothes we 'd got , and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat . 
Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat , because if they 'd a knowed the money was there they would n't a left it . 
I said I reckoned they killed him , too ; but Jim did n't want to talk about that . 
I says : Now you think it 's bad luck ; but what did you say when I fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday ? 
You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin with my hands . 
Well , here 's your bad luck ! 
We 've raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides . 
I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day , Jim . 
Never you mind , honey , never you mind . 
Do n't you git too peart . 
It's a-comin ' . 
Mind I tell you , it 's a-comin ' . 
It did come , too . 
It was a Tuesday that we had that talk . 
Well , after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge , and got out of tobacco . 
I went to the cavern to get some , and found a rattlesnake in there . 
I killed him , and curled him up on the foot of Jim 's blanket , ever so natural , thinking there 'd be some fun when Jim found him there . 
Well , by night I forgot all about the snake , and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake 's mate was there , and bit him . 
He jumped up yelling , and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring . 
I laid him out in a second with a stick , and Jim grabbed pap 's whisky-jug and begun to pour it down . 
He was barefooted , and the snake bit him right on the heel . 
That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it . 
Jim told me to chop off the snake 's head and throw it away , and then skin the body and roast a piece of it . 
I done it , and he eat it and said it would help cure him . 
He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist , too . 
He said that that would help . 
Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes ; for I war n't going to let Jim find out it was all my fault , not if I could help it . 
Jim sucked and sucked at the jug , and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled ; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again . 
His foot swelled up pretty big , and so did his leg ; but by and by the drunk begun to come , and so I judged he was all right ; but I 'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's whisky . 
Jim was laid up for four days and nights . 
Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again . 
I made up my mind I would n't ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands , now that I see what had come of it . 
Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time . 
And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't got to the end of it yet . 
He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand . 
Well , I was getting to feel that way myself , though I've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do . 
Old Hank Bunker done it once , and bragged about it ; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower , and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer , as you may say ; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin , and buried him so , so they say , but I did n't see it . 
Pap told me . 
But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way , like a fool . 
Well , the days went along , and the river went down between its banks again ; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man , being six foot two inches long , and weighed over two hundred pounds . 
We could n't handle him , of course ; he would a flung us into Illinois . 
We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded . 
We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball , and lots of rubbage . 
We split the ball open with the hatchet , and there was a spool in it . 
Jim said he 'd had it there a long time , to coat it over so and make a ball of it . 
It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi , I reckon . 
Jim said he had n't ever seen a bigger one . 
He would a been worth a good deal over at the village . 
They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there ; everybody buys some of him ; his meat 's as white as snow and makes a good fry . 
Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull , and I wanted to get a stirring up some way . 
I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on . 
Jim liked that notion ; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp . 
Then he studied it over and said , could n't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl ? 
That was a good notion , too . 
So we shortened up one of the calico gowns , and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it . 
Jim hitched it behind with the hooks , and it was a fair fit . 
I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin , and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe . 
Jim said nobody would know me , even in the daytime , hardly . 
I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things , and by and by I could do pretty well in them , only Jim said I did n't walk like a girl ; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket . 
I took notice , and done better . 
I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark . 
I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing , and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town . 
I tied up and started along the bank . 
There was a light burning in a little shanty that had n't been lived in for a long time , and I wondered who had took up quarters there . 
I slipped up and peeped in at the window . 
There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table . 
I did n't know her face ; she was a stranger , for you could n't start a face in that town that I did n't know . 
Now this was lucky , because I was weakening ; I was getting afraid I had come ; people might know my voice and find me out . 
But if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know ; so I knocked at the door , and made up my mind I would n't forget I was a girl . 
. 
COME in , says the woman , and I did . 
She says : Take a cheer . 
I done it . 
She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes , and says : What might your name be ? 
Sarah Williams . 
Where 'bouts do you live ? 
In this neighborhood ? ' 
No 'm . 
In Hookerville , seven mile below . 
I 've walked all the way and I 'm all tired out . 
Hungry , too , I reckon . 
I 'll find you something . 
No 'm , I ai n't hungry . 
I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below here at a farm ; so I ai n't hungry no more . 
It 's what makes me so late . 
My mother 's down sick , and out of money and everything , and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore . 
He lives at the upper end of the town , she says . 
I hai n't ever been here before . 
Do you know him ? 
No ; but I do n't know everybody yet . 
I have n't lived here quite two weeks . 
It 's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town . 
You better stay here all night . 
Take off your bonnet . 
No , I says ; I 'll rest a while , I reckon , and go on . 
I ai n't afeared of the dark . 
She said she would n't let me go by myself , but her husband would be in by and by , maybe in a hour and a half , and she 'd send him along with me . 
Then she got to talking about her husband , and about her relations up the river , and her relations down the river , and about how much better off they used to was , and how they did n't know but they 'd made a mistake coming to our town , instead of letting well alone -- and so on and so on , till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town ; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder , and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along . 
She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars ( only she got it ten ) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was , and what a hard lot I was , and at last she got down to where I was murdered . 
I says : Who done it ? 
We 've heard considerable about these goings on down in Hookerville , but we do n't know who 't was that killed Huck Finn . 
Well , I reckon there 's a right smart chance of people _here_ that'd like to know who killed him . 
Some think old Finn done it himself . 
No -- is that so ? 
Most everybody thought it at first . 
He 'll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched . 
But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim . 
Why _he_ -- I stopped . 
I reckoned I better keep still . 
She run on , and never noticed I had put in at all : The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed . 
So there 's a reward out for him -- three hundred dollars . 
And there 's a reward out for old Finn , too -- two hundred dollars . 
You see , he come to town the morning after the murder , and told about it , and was out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt , and right away after he up and left . 
Before night they wanted to lynch him , but he was gone , you see . 
Well , next day they found out the nigger was gone ; they found out he had n't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done . 
So then they put it on him , you see ; and while they was full of it , next day , back comes old Finn , and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with . 
The judge gave him some , and that evening he got drunk , and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers , and then went off with them . 
Well , he hain't come back sence , and they ai n't looking for him back till this thing blows over a little , for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it , and then he 'd get Huck 's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit . 
People do say he war n't any too good to do it . 
Oh , he 's sly , I reckon . 
If he do n't come back for a year he 'll be all right . 
You ca n't prove anything on him , you know ; everything will be quieted down then , and he 'll walk in Huck 's money as easy as nothing . 
Yes , I reckon so , 'm . 
I do n't see nothing in the way of it . 
Has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it ? 
Oh , no , not everybody . 
A good many thinks he done it . 
But they 'll get the nigger pretty soon now , and maybe they can scare it out of him . 
Why , are they after him yet ? 
Well , you 're innocent , ai n't you ! 
Does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up ? 
Some folks think the nigger ai n't far from here . 
I 'm one of them -- but I hai n't talked it around . 
A few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty , and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson 's Island . 
Do n't anybody live there ? 
says I . 
No , nobody , says they . 
I did n't say any more , but I done some thinking . 
I was pretty near certain I 'd seen smoke over there , about the head of the island , a day or two before that , so I says to myself , like as not that nigger 's hiding over there ; anyway , says I , it 's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt . 
I hai n't seen any smoke sence , so I reckon maybe he 's gone , if it was him ; but husband's going over to see -- him and another man . 
He was gone up the river ; but he got back to-day , and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago . 
I had got so uneasy I could n't set still . 
I had to do something with my hands ; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it . 
My hands shook , and I was making a bad job of it . 
When the woman stopped talking I looked up , and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little . 
I put down the needle and thread , and let on to be interested -- and I was , too -- and says : Three hundred dollars is a power of money . 
I wish my mother could get it . 
Is your husband going over there to-night ? 
Oh , yes . 
He went up-town with the man I was telling you of , to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun . 
They 'll go over after midnight . 
Could n't they see better if they was to wait till daytime ? 
Yes . 
And could n't the nigger see better , too ? 
After midnight he'll likely be asleep , and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark , if he 's got one . 
I did n't think of that . 
The woman kept looking at me pretty curious , and I did n't feel a bit comfortable . 
Pretty soon she says , What did you say your name was , honey ? 
M -- Mary Williams . 
Somehow it did n't seem to me that I said it was Mary before , so I didn't look up -- seemed to me I said it was Sarah ; so I felt sort of cornered , and was afeared maybe I was looking it , too . 
I wished the woman would say something more ; the longer she set still the uneasier I was . 
But now she says : Honey , I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in ? 
Oh , yes 'm , I did . 
Sarah Mary Williams . 
Sarah 's my first name . 
Some calls me Sarah , some calls me Mary . 
Oh , that 's the way of it ? 
Yes 'm . 
I was feeling better then , but I wished I was out of there , anyway . 
I could n't look up yet . 
Well , the woman fell to talking about how hard times was , and how poor they had to live , and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place , and so forth and so on , and then I got easy again . 
She was right about the rats . 
You 'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while . 
She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone , or they would n't give her no peace . 
She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot , and said she was a good shot with it generly , but she 'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago , and didn't know whether she could throw true now . 
But she watched for a chance , and directly banged away at a rat ; but she missed him wide , and said Ouch ! 
it hurt her arm so . 
Then she told me to try for the next one . 
I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back , but of course I did n't let on . 
I got the thing , and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive , and if he 'd a stayed where he was he 'd a been a tolerable sick rat . 
She said that was first-rate , and she reckoned I would hive the next one . 
She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back , and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with . 
I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them , and went on talking about her and her husband 's matters . 
But she broke off to say : Keep your eye on the rats . 
You better have the lead in your lap , handy . 
So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment , and I clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking . 
But only about a minute . 
Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face , and very pleasant , and says : Come , now , what 's your real name ? 
Wh -- what , mum ? 
What 's your real name ? 
Is it Bill , or Tom , or Bob ? -- or what is it ? 
I reckon I shook like a leaf , and I did n't know hardly what to do . 
But I says : Please to do n't poke fun at a poor girl like me , mum . 
If I 'm in the way here , I 'll -- No , you wo n't . 
Set down and stay where you are . 
I ai n't going to hurt you , and I ai n't going to tell on you , nuther . 
You just tell me your secret , and trust me . 
I 'll keep it ; and , what 's more , I 'll help you . 
So 'll my old man if you want him to . 
You see , you 're a runaway 'prentice , that 's all . 
It ai n't anything . 
There ai n't no harm in it . 
You 've been treated bad , and you made up your mind to cut . 
Bless you , child , I would n't tell on you . 
Tell me all about it now , that 's a good boy . 
So I said it would n't be no use to try to play it any longer , and I would just make a clean breast and tell her everything , but she musn't go back on her promise . 
Then I told her my father and mother was dead , and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river , and he treated me so bad I could n't stand it no longer ; he went away to be gone a couple of days , and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter 's old clothes and cleared out , and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles . 
I traveled nights , and hid daytimes and slept , and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way , and I had a-plenty . 
I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me , and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen . 
Goshen , child ? 
This ai n't Goshen . 
This is St. Petersburg . 
Goshen's ten mile further up the river . 
Who told you this was Goshen ? 
Why , a man I met at daybreak this morning , just as I was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep . 
He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand , and five mile would fetch me to Goshen . 
He was drunk , I reckon . 
He told you just exactly wrong . 
Well , he did act like he was drunk , but it ai n't no matter now . 
I got to be moving along . 
I 'll fetch Goshen before daylight . 
Hold on a minute . 
I 'll put you up a snack to eat . 
You might want it . 
So she put me up a snack , and says : Say , when a cow 's laying down , which end of her gets up first ? 
Answer up prompt now -- do n't stop to study over it . 
Which end gets up first ? 
The hind end , mum . 
Well , then , a horse ? 
The for'rard end , mum . 
Which side of a tree does the moss grow on ? 
North side . 
If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside , how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction ? 
The whole fifteen , mum . 
Well , I reckon you _have_ lived in the country . 
I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again . 
What 's your real name , now ? 
George Peters , mum . 
Well , try to remember it , George . 
Do n't forget and tell me it's Elexander before you go , and then get out by saying it 's George Elexander when I catch you . 
And do n't go about women in that old calico . 
You do a girl tolerable poor , but you might fool men , maybe . 
Bless you , child , when you set out to thread a needle do n't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it ; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it ; that 's the way a woman most always does , but a man always does t'other way . 
And when you throw at a rat or anything , hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can , and miss your rat about six or seven foot . 
Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder , like there was a pivot there for it to turn on , like a girl ; not from the wrist and elbow , with your arm out to one side , like a boy . 
And , mind you , when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart ; she do n't clap them together , the way you did when you catched the lump of lead . 
Why , I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle ; and I contrived the other things just to make certain . 
Now trot along to your uncle , Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters , and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus , which is me , and I 'll do what I can to get you out of it . 
Keep the river road all the way , and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you . 
The river road 's a rocky one , and your feet 'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen , I reckon . 
I went up the bank about fifty yards , and then I doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was , a good piece below the house . 
I jumped in , and was off in a hurry . 
I went up-stream far enough to make the head of the island , and then started across . 
I took off the sun-bonnet , for I did n't want no blinders on then . 
When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike , so I stops and listens ; the sound come faint over the water but clear -- eleven . 
When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow , though I was most winded , but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be , and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot . 
Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place , a mile and a half below , as hard as I could go . 
I landed , and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern . 
There Jim laid , sound asleep on the ground . 
I roused him out and says : Git up and hump yourself , Jim ! 
There ai n't a minute to lose . 
They're after us ! 
Jim never asked no questions , he never said a word ; but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared . 
By that time everything we had in the world was on our raft , and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid . 
We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing , and did n't show a candle outside after that . 
I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece , and took a look ; but if there was a boat around I could n't see it , for stars and shadows ai n't good to see by . 
Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade , past the foot of the island dead still -- never saying a word . 
. 
IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at last , and the raft did seem to go mighty slow . 
If a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore ; and it was well a boat did n't come , for we had n't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe , or a fishing-line , or anything to eat . 
We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things . 
It warn't good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft . 
If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I built , and watched it all night for Jim to come . 
Anyways , they stayed away from us , and if my building the fire never fooled them it war n't no fault of mine . 
I played it as low down on them as I could . 
When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side , and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet , and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there . 
A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth . 
We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side , and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place , so we war n't afraid of anybody running across us . 
We laid there all day , and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore , and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle . 
I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman ; and Jim said she was a smart one , and if she was to start after us herself she would n't set down and watch a camp fire -- no , sir , she 'd fetch a dog . 
Well , then , I said , why could n't she tell her husband to fetch a dog ? 
Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start , and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that time , or else we would n't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village -- no , indeedy , we would be in that same old town again . 
So I said I did n't care what was the reason they did n't get us as long as they did n't . 
When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket , and looked up and down and across ; nothing in sight ; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy , and to keep the things dry . 
Jim made a floor for the wigwam , and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft , so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves . 
Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place ; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly ; the wigwam would keep it from being seen . 
We made an extra steering-oar , too , because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something . 
We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on , because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream , to keep from getting run over ; but we would n't have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a crossing ; for the river was pretty high yet , very low banks being still a little under water ; so up-bound boats did n't always run the channel , but hunted easy water . 
This second night we run between seven and eight hours , with a current that was making over four mile an hour . 
We catched fish and talked , and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness . 
It was kind of solemn , drifting down the big , still river , laying on our backs looking up at the stars , and we did n't ever feel like talking loud , and it war n't often that we laughed -- only a little kind of a low chuckle . 
We had mighty good weather as a general thing , and nothing ever happened to us at all -- that night , nor the next , nor the next . 
Every night we passed towns , some of them away up on black hillsides , nothing but just a shiny bed of lights ; not a house could you see . 
The fifth night we passed St. Louis , and it was like the whole world lit up . 
In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis , but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still night . 
There war n't a sound there ; everybody was asleep . 
Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little village , and buy ten or fifteen cents ' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat ; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that war n't roosting comfortable , and took him along . 
Pap always said , take a chicken when you get a chance , because if you do n't want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does , and a good deed ai n't ever forgot . 
I never see pap when he did n't want the chicken himself , but that is what he used to say , anyway . 
Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon , or a mushmelon , or a punkin , or some new corn , or things of that kind . 
Pap always said it war n't no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time ; but the widow said it warn't anything but a soft name for stealing , and no decent body would do it . 
Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right ; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we would n't borrow them any more -- then he reckoned it would n't be no harm to borrow the others . 
So we talked it over all one night , drifting along down the river , trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons , or the cantelopes , or the mushmelons , or what . 
But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory , and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons . 
We war n't feeling just right before that , but it was all comfortable now . 
I was glad the way it come out , too , because crabapples ai n't ever good , and the p'simmons would n't be ripe for two or three months yet . 
We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or did n't go to bed early enough in the evening . 
Take it all round , we lived pretty high . 
The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight , with a power of thunder and lightning , and the rain poured down in a solid sheet . 
We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself . 
When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead , and high , rocky bluffs on both sides . 
By and by says I , Hel-_lo_ , Jim , looky yonder ! 
It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock . 
We was drifting straight down for her . 
The lightning showed her very distinct . 
She was leaning over , with part of her upper deck above water , and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear , and a chair by the big bell , with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it , when the flashes come . 
Well , it being away in the night and stormy , and all so mysterious-like , I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river . 
I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little , and see what there was there . 
So I says : Le 's land on her , Jim . 
But Jim was dead against it at first . 
He says : I doan ' want to go fool ' n 'long er no wrack . 
We 's doin ' blame ' well , en we better let blame ' well alone , as de good book says . 
Like as not dey 's a watchman on dat wrack . 
Watchman your grandmother , I says ; there ai n't nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house ; and do you reckon anybody 's going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this , when it 's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute ? 
Jim could n't say nothing to that , so he did n't try . 
And besides , I says , we might borrow something worth having out of the captain 's stateroom . 
Seegars , I bet you -- and cost five cents apiece , solid cash . 
Steamboat captains is always rich , and get sixty dollars a month , and _they_ don't care a cent what a thing costs , you know , long as they want it . 
Stick a candle in your pocket ; I ca n't rest , Jim , till we give her a rummaging . 
Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing ? 
Not for pie , he would n't . 
He 'd call it an adventure -- that 's what he 'd call it ; and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act . 
And would n't he throw style into it ? -- would n't he spread himself , nor nothing ? 
Why , you 'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come . 
I wish Tom Sawyer _was_ here . 
Jim he grumbled a little , but give in . 
He said we must n't talk any more than we could help , and then talk mighty low . 
The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time , and we fetched the stabboard derrick , and made fast there . 
The deck was high out here . 
We went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard , in the dark , towards the texas , feeling our way slow with our feet , and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys , for it was so dark we could n't see no sign of them . 
Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight , and clumb on to it ; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain 's door , which was open , and by Jimminy , away down through the texas-hall we see a light ! 
and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder ! 
Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick , and told me to come along . 
I says , all right , and was going to start for the raft ; but just then I heard a voice wail out and say : Oh , please do n't , boys ; I swear I wo n't ever tell ! 
Another voice said , pretty loud : It 's a lie , Jim Turner . 
You 've acted this way before . 
You always want more ' n your share of the truck , and you 've always got it , too , because you 've swore 't if you did n't you 'd tell . 
But this time you 've said it jest one time too many . 
You 're the meanest , treacherousest hound in this country . 
By this time Jim was gone for the raft . 
I was just a-biling with curiosity ; and I says to myself , Tom Sawyer would n't back out now , and so I wo n't either ; I 'm a-going to see what 's going on here . 
So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage , and crept aft in the dark till there war n't but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas . 
Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot , and two men standing over him , and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand , and the other one had a pistol . 
This one kept pointing the pistol at the man 's head on the floor , and saying : I 'd _like_ to ! 
And I orter , too -- a mean skunk ! 
The man on the floor would shrivel up and say , Oh , please do n't , Bill ; I hai n't ever goin ' to tell . 
And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say : 'Deed you _ai n't ! _ You never said no truer thing ' n that , you bet you . 
And once he said : Hear him beg ! 
and yit if we had n't got the best of him and tied him he 'd a killed us both . 
And what _for_ ? 
Jist for noth ' n . 
Jist because we stood on our _rights_ -- that 's what for . 
But I lay you ai n't a-goin ' to threaten nobody any more , Jim Turner . 
Put _up_ that pistol , Bill . 
Bill says : I do n't want to , Jake Packard . 
I 'm for killin ' him -- and did n't he kill old Hatfield jist the same way -- and do n't he deserve it ? 
But I do n't _want_ him killed , and I 've got my reasons for it . 
Bless yo ' heart for them words , Jake Packard ! 
I 'll never forgit you long 's I live ! 
says the man on the floor , sort of blubbering . 
Packard did n't take no notice of that , but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark , and motioned Bill to come . 
I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards , but the boat slanted so that I could n't make very good time ; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side . 
The man came a-pawing along in the dark , and when Packard got to my stateroom , he says : Here -- come in here . 
And in he come , and Bill after him . 
But before they got in I was up in the upper berth , cornered , and sorry I come . 
Then they stood there , with their hands on the ledge of the berth , and talked . 
I could n't see them , but I could tell where they was by the whisky they 'd been having . 
I was glad I did n't drink whisky ; but it would n't made much difference anyway , because most of the time they could n't a treed me because I did n't breathe . 
I was too scared . 
And , besides , a body _couldn't_ breathe and hear such talk . 
They talked low and earnest . 
Bill wanted to kill Turner . 
He says : He 's said he 'll tell , and he will . 
If we was to give both our shares to him _now_ it would n't make no difference after the row and the way we 've served him . 
Shore 's you 're born , he 'll turn State 's evidence ; now you hear _me_ . 
I 'm for putting him out of his troubles . 
So 'm I , says Packard , very quiet . 
Blame it , I 'd sorter begun to think you was n't . 
Well , then , that 's all right . 
Le 's go and do it . 
Hold on a minute ; I hai n't had my say yit . 
You listen to me . 
Shooting 's good , but there 's quieter ways if the thing 's _got_ to be done . 
But what I say is this : it ai n't good sense to go court ' n around after a halter if you can git at what you 're up to in some way that's jist as good and at the same time do n't bring you into no resks . 
Ain't that so ? 
You bet it is . 
But how you goin ' to manage it this time ? 
Well , my idea is this : we 'll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we 've overlooked in the staterooms , and shove for shore and hide the truck . 
Then we 'll wait . 
Now I say it ai n't a-goin ' to be more ' n two hours befo ' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river . 
See ? 
He 'll be drownded , and wo n't have nobody to blame for it but his own self . 
I reckon that 's a considerble sight better ' n killin ' of him . 
I 'm unfavorable to killin ' a man as long as you can git aroun ' it ; it ai n't good sense , it ai n't good morals . 
Ai n't I right ? 
Yes , I reck ' n you are . 
But s'pose she _don't_ break up and wash off ? 
Well , we can wait the two hours anyway and see , ca n't we ? 
All right , then ; come along . 
So they started , and I lit out , all in a cold sweat , and scrambled forward . 
It was dark as pitch there ; but I said , in a kind of a coarse whisper , Jim ! 
and he answered up , right at my elbow , with a sort of a moan , and I says : Quick , Jim , it ai n't no time for fooling around and moaning ; there 's a gang of murderers in yonder , and if we do n't hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows ca n't get away from the wreck there 's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix . 
But if we find their boat we can put _all_ of 'em in a bad fix -- for the sheriff 'll get 'em . 
Quick -- hurry ! 
I 'll hunt the labboard side , you hunt the stabboard . 
You start at the raft , and -- Oh , my lordy , lordy ! 
_raf ' _ ? 
Dey ain ' no raf ' no mo ' ; she done broke loose en gone I -- en here we is ! 
. 
WELL , I catched my breath and most fainted . 
Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that ! 
But it war n't no time to be sentimentering . 
We'd _got_ to find that boat now -- had to have it for ourselves . 
So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side , and slow work it was , too -- seemed a week before we got to the stern . 
No sign of a boat . 
Jim said he did n't believe he could go any further -- so scared he hadn't hardly any strength left , he said . 
But I said , come on , if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix , sure . 
So on we prowled again . 
We struck for the stern of the texas , and found it , and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight , hanging on from shutter to shutter , for the edge of the skylight was in the water . 
When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff , sure enough ! 
I could just barely see her . 
I felt ever so thankful . 
In another second I would a been aboard of her , but just then the door opened . 
One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me , and I thought I was gone ; but he jerked it in again , and says : Heave that blame lantern out o ' sight , Bill ! 
He flung a bag of something into the boat , and then got in himself and set down . 
It was Packard . 
Then Bill _he_ come out and got in . 
Packard says , in a low voice : All ready -- shove off ! 
I could n't hardly hang on to the shutters , I was so weak . 
But Bill says : Hold on -- 'd you go through him ? 
No . 
Did n't you ? 
No . 
So he 's got his share o ' the cash yet . 
Well , then , come along ; no use to take truck and leave money . 
Say , wo n't he suspicion what we 're up to ? 
Maybe he wo n't . 
But we got to have it anyway . 
Come along . 
So they got out and went in . 
The door slammed to because it was on the careened side ; and in a half second I was in the boat , and Jim come tumbling after me . 
I out with my knife and cut the rope , and away we went ! 
We did n't touch an oar , and we did n't speak nor whisper , nor hardly even breathe . 
We went gliding swift along , dead silent , past the tip of the paddle-box , and past the stern ; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck , and the darkness soaked her up , every last sign of her , and we was safe , and knowed it . 
When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second , and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat , and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was . 
Then Jim manned the oars , and we took out after our raft . 
Now was the first time that I begun to worry about the men -- I reckon I hadn't had time to before . 
I begun to think how dreadful it was , even for murderers , to be in such a fix . 
I says to myself , there ai n't no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet , and then how would I like it ? 
So says I to Jim : The first light we see we 'll land a hundred yards below it or above it , in a place where it 's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff , and then I 'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn , and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape , so they can be hung when their time comes . 
But that idea was a failure ; for pretty soon it begun to storm again , and this time worse than ever . 
The rain poured down , and never a light showed ; everybody in bed , I reckon . 
We boomed along down the river , watching for lights and watching for our raft . 
After a long time the rain let up , but the clouds stayed , and the lightning kept whimpering , and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead , floating , and we made for it . 
It was the raft , and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again . 
We seen a light now away down to the right , on shore . 
So I said I would go for it . 
The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck . 
We hustled it on to the raft in a pile , and I told Jim to float along down , and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile , and keep it burning till I come ; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light . 
As I got down towards it three or four more showed -- up on a hillside . 
It was a village . 
I closed in above the shore light , and laid on my oars and floated . 
As I went by I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat . 
I skimmed around for the watchman , a-wondering whereabouts he slept ; and by and by I found him roosting on the bitts forward , with his head down between his knees . 
I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves , and begun to cry . 
He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way ; but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch , and then he says : Hello , what 's up ? 
Do n't cry , bub . 
What 's the trouble ? 
I says : Pap , and mam , and sis , and -- Then I broke down . 
He says : Oh , dang it now , _don't_ take on so ; we all has to have our troubles , and this ' n 'll come out all right . 
What 's the matter with 'em ? 
They 're -- they 're -- are you the watchman of the boat ? 
Yes , he says , kind of pretty-well-satisfied like . 
I 'm the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck-hand ; and sometimes I 'm the freight and passengers . 
I ai n't as rich as old Jim Hornback , and I ca n't be so blame ' generous and good to Tom , Dick , and Harry as what he is , and slam around money the way he does ; but I 've told him a many a time 't I would n't trade places with him ; for , says I , a sailor 's life 's the life for me , and I 'm derned if _I'd_ live two mile out o ' town , where there ai n't nothing ever goin' on , not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it . 
Says I -- I broke in and says : They 're in an awful peck of trouble , and -- _Who_ is ? 
Why , pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker ; and if you 'd take your ferryboat and go up there -- Up where ? 
Where are they ? 
On the wreck . 
What wreck ? 
Why , there ai n't but one . 
What , you do n't mean the Walter Scott ? 
Yes . 
Good land ! 
what are they doin ' _there_ , for gracious sakes ? 
Well , they did n't go there a-purpose . 
I bet they did n't ! 
Why , great goodness , there ai n't no chance for 'em if they do n't git off mighty quick ! 
Why , how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape ? 
Easy enough . 
Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town -- Yes , Booth 's Landing -- go on . 
She was a-visiting there at Booth 's Landing , and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend 's house , Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name -- and they lost their steering-oar , and swung around and went a-floating down , stern first , about two mile , and saddle-baggsed on the wreck , and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost , but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck . 
Well , about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow , and it was so dark we did n't notice the wreck till we was right on it ; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed ; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple -- and oh , he _was_ the best cretur ! -- I most wish 't it had been me , I do . 
My George ! 
It 's the beatenest thing I ever struck . 
And _then_ what did you all do ? 
Well , we hollered and took on , but it 's so wide there we couldn't make nobody hear . 
So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow . 
I was the only one that could swim , so I made a dash for it , and Miss Hooker she said if I did n't strike help sooner , come here and hunt up her uncle , and he 'd fix the thing . 
I made the land about a mile below , and been fooling along ever since , trying to get people to do something , but they said , 'What , in such a night and such a current ? 
There ai n't no sense in it ; go for the steam ferry . ' 
Now if you 'll go and -- By Jackson , I 'd _like_ to , and , blame it , I do n't know but I will ; but who in the dingnation 's a-going ' to _pay_ for it ? 
Do you reckon your pap -- Why _that's_ all right . 
Miss Hooker she tole me , _particular_ , that her uncle Hornback -- Great guns ! 
is _he_ her uncle ? 
Looky here , you break for that light over yonder-way , and turn out west when you git there , and about a quarter of a mile out you 'll come to the tavern ; tell 'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback 's , and he 'll foot the bill . 
And do n't you fool around any , because he 'll want to know the news . 
Tell him I 'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town . 
Hump yourself , now ; I'm a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer . 
I struck for the light , but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out , and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards , and tucked myself in among some woodboats ; for I could n't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start . 
But take it all around , I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang , for not many would a done it . 
I wished the widow knowed about it . 
I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions , because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in . 
Well , before long here comes the wreck , dim and dusky , sliding along down ! 
A kind of cold shiver went through me , and then I struck out for her . 
She was very deep , and I see in a minute there war n't much chance for anybody being alive in her . 
I pulled all around her and hollered a little , but there was n't any answer ; all dead still . 
I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang , but not much , for I reckoned if they could stand it I could . 
Then here comes the ferryboat ; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant ; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars , and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker 's remainders , because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them ; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore , and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river . 
It did seem a powerful long time before Jim 's light showed up ; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off . 
By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east ; so we struck for an island , and hid the raft , and sunk the skiff , and turned in and slept like dead people . 
. 
BY and by , when we got up , we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck , and found boots , and blankets , and clothes , and all sorts of other things , and a lot of books , and a spyglass , and three boxes of seegars . 
We had n't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives . 
The seegars was prime . 
We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking , and me reading the books , and having a general good time . 
I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat , and I said these kinds of things was adventures ; but he said he did n't want no more adventures . 
He said that when I went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died , because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could be fixed ; for if he did n't get saved he would get drownded ; and if he did get saved , whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward , and then Miss Watson would sell him South , sure . 
Well , he was right ; he was most always right ; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger . 
I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such , and how gaudy they dressed , and how much style they put on , and called each other your majesty , and your grace , and your lordship , and so on , 'stead of mister ; and Jim 's eyes bugged out , and he was interested . 
He says : I didn ' know dey was so many un um . 
I hai n't hearn 'bout none un um , skasely , but ole King Sollermun , onless you counts dem kings dat 's in a pack er k'yards . 
How much do a king git ? 
Get ? 
I says ; why , they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it ; they can have just as much as they want ; everything belongs to them . 
_Ain ' _ dat gay ? 
En what dey got to do , Huck ? 
_They_ do n't do nothing ! 
Why , how you talk ! 
They just set around . 
No ; is dat so ? 
Of course it is . 
They just set around -- except , maybe , when there 's a war ; then they go to the war . 
But other times they just lazy around ; or go hawking -- just hawking and sp -- Sh ! -- d ' you hear a noise ? 
We skipped out and looked ; but it war n't nothing but the flutter of a steamboat 's wheel away down , coming around the point ; so we come back . 
Yes , says I , and other times , when things is dull , they fuss with the parlyment ; and if everybody do n't go just so he whacks their heads off . 
But mostly they hang round the harem . 
Roun ' de which ? 
Harem . 
What 's de harem ? 
The place where he keeps his wives . 
Do n't you know about the harem ? 
Solomon had one ; he had about a million wives . 
Why , yes , dat 's so ; I -- I 'd done forgot it . 
A harem 's a bo 'd ' n-house , I reck ' n . 
Mos ' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery . 
En I reck ' n de wives quarrels considable ; en dat 'crease de racket . 
Yit dey say Sollermun de wises ' man dat ever live ' . 
I doan ' take no stock in dat . 
Bekase why : would a wise man want to live in de mids ' er sich a blim-blammin ' all de time ? 
No -- 'deed he would n't . 
A wise man 'ud take en buil ' a biler-factry ; en den he could shet _down_ de biler-factry when he want to res ' . 
Well , but he _was_ the wisest man , anyway ; because the widow she told me so , her own self . 
I doan k'yer what de widder say , he _warn't_ no wise man nuther . 
He had some er de dad-fetchedes ' ways I ever see . 
Does you know 'bout dat chile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two ? 
Yes , the widow told me all about it . 
_Well_ , den ! 
Warn ' dat de beatenes ' notion in de worl ' ? 
You jes' take en look at it a minute . 
Dah 's de stump , dah -- dat 's one er de women ; heah 's you -- dat 's de yuther one ; I 's Sollermun ; en dish yer dollar bill's de chile . 
Bofe un you claims it . 
What does I do ? 
Does I shin aroun' mongs ' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill _do_ b'long to , en han ' it over to de right one , all safe en soun ' , de way dat anybody dat had any gumption would ? 
No ; I take en whack de bill in _two_ , en give half un it to you , en de yuther half to de yuther woman . 
Dat 's de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile . 
Now I want to ast you : what's de use er dat half a bill ? -- ca n't buy noth ' n wid it . 
En what use is a half a chile ? 
I wouldn ' give a dern for a million un um . 
But hang it , Jim , you 've clean missed the point -- blame it , you 've missed it a thousand mile . 
Who ? 
Me ? 
Go 'long . 
Doan ' talk to me 'bout yo ' pints . 
I reck ' n I knows sense when I sees it ; en dey ain ' no sense in sich doin 's as dat . 
De 'spute war n't 'bout a half a chile , de 'spute was 'bout a whole chile ; en de man dat think he kin settle a 'spute 'bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan ' know enough to come in out ' n de rain . 
Doan' talk to me 'bout Sollermun , Huck , I knows him by de back . 
But I tell you you do n't get the point . 
Blame de point ! 
I reck ' n I knows what I knows . 
En mine you , de _real_ pint is down furder -- it 's down deeper . 
It lays in de way Sollermun was raised . 
You take a man dat 's got on ' y one or two chillen ; is dat man gwyne to be waseful o ' chillen ? 
No , he ai n't ; he ca n't 'ford it . 
_He_ know how to value 'em . 
But you take a man dat 's got 'bout five million chillen runnin ' roun ' de house , en it 's diffunt . 
_He_ as soon chop a chile in two as a cat . 
Dey 's plenty mo ' . 
A chile er two , mo ' er less , war n't no consekens to Sollermun , dad fatch him ! 
I never see such a nigger . 
If he got a notion in his head once , there war n't no getting it out again . 
He was the most down on Solomon of any nigger I ever see . 
So I went to talking about other kings , and let Solomon slide . 
I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off in France long time ago ; and about his little boy the dolphin , that would a been a king , but they took and shut him up in jail , and some say he died there . 
Po ' little chap . 
But some says he got out and got away , and come to America . 
Dat 's good ! 
But he 'll be pooty lonesome -- dey ain ' no kings here , is dey , Huck ? 
No . 
Den he cai n't git no situation . 
What he gwyne to do ? 
Well , I do n't know . 
Some of them gets on the police , and some of them learns people how to talk French . 
Why , Huck , doan ' de French people talk de same way we does ? 
_No_ , Jim ; you could n't understand a word they said -- not a single word . 
Well , now , I be ding-busted ! 
How do dat come ? 
I do n't know ; but it 's so . 
I got some of their jabber out of a book . 
S'pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy -- what would you think ? 
I wouldn ' think nuff ' n ; I 'd take en bust him over de head -- dat is , if he war n't white . 
I would n't 'low no nigger to call me dat . 
Shucks , it ai n't calling you anything . 
It 's only saying , do you know how to talk French ? 
Well , den , why could n't he _say_ it ? 
Why , he _is_ a-saying it . 
That 's a Frenchman 's _way_ of saying it . 
Well , it 's a blame ridicklous way , en I doan ' want to hear no mo ' 'bout it . 
Dey ain ' no sense in it . 
Looky here , Jim ; does a cat talk like we do ? 
No , a cat do n't . 
Well , does a cow ? 
No , a cow do n't , nuther . 
Does a cat talk like a cow , or a cow talk like a cat ? 
No , dey do n't . 
It 's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other , ain't it ? 
Course . 
And ai n't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from _us_ ? 
Why , mos ' sholy it is . 
Well , then , why ai n't it natural and right for a _Frenchman_ to talk different from us ? 
You answer me that . 
Is a cat a man , Huck ? 
No . 
Well , den , dey ai n't no sense in a cat talkin ' like a man . 
Is a cow a man ? -- er is a cow a cat ? 
No , she ai n't either of them . 
Well , den , she ai n't got no business to talk like either one er the yuther of 'em . 
Is a Frenchman a man ? 
Yes . 
_Well_ , den ! 
Dad blame it , why doan ' he _talk_ like a man ? 
You answer me _dat_ ! 
I see it war n't no use wasting words -- you ca n't learn a nigger to argue . 
So I quit . 
. 
WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo , at the bottom of Illinois , where the Ohio River comes in , and that was what we was after . 
We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States , and then be out of trouble . 
Well , the second night a fog begun to come on , and we made for a towhead to tie to , for it would n't do to try to run in a fog ; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe , with the line to make fast , there war n't anything but little saplings to tie to . 
I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank , but there was a stiff current , and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went . 
I see the fog closing down , and it made me so sick and scared I could n't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me -- and then there war n't no raft in sight ; you could n't see twenty yards . 
I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern , and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke . 
But she did n't come . 
I was in such a hurry I had n't untied her . 
I got up and tried to untie her , but I was so excited my hands shook so I could n't hardly do anything with them . 
As soon as I got started I took out after the raft , hot and heavy , right down the towhead . 
That was all right as far as it went , but the towhead war n't sixty yards long , and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog , and had n't no more idea which way I was going than a dead man . 
Thinks I , it wo n't do to paddle ; first I know I 'll run into the bank or a towhead or something ; I got to set still and float , and yet it's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time . 
I whooped and listened . 
Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop , and up comes my spirits . 
I went tearing after it , listening sharp to hear it again . 
The next time it come I see I war n't heading for it , but heading away to the right of it . 
And the next time I was heading away to the left of it -- and not gaining on it much either , for I was flying around , this way and that and t'other , but it was going straight ahead all the time . 
I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan , and beat it all the time , but he never did , and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me . 
Well , I fought along , and directly I hears the whoop _behind_ me . 
I was tangled good now . 
That was somebody else 's whoop , or else I was turned around . 
I throwed the paddle down . 
I heard the whoop again ; it was behind me yet , but in a different place ; it kept coming , and kept changing its place , and I kept answering , till by and by it was in front of me again , and I knowed the current had swung the canoe 's head down-stream , and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering . 
I could n't tell nothing about voices in a fog , for nothing do n't look natural nor sound natural in a fog . 
The whooping went on , and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it , and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by , amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared , the currrent was tearing by them so swift . 
In another second or two it was solid white and still again . 
I set perfectly still then , listening to my heart thump , and I reckon I didn't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred . 
I just give up then . 
I knowed what the matter was . 
That cut bank was an island , and Jim had gone down t'other side of it . 
It war n't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes . 
It had the big timber of a regular island ; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide . 
I kept quiet , with my ears cocked , about fifteen minutes , I reckon . 
I was floating along , of course , four or five miles an hour ; but you don't ever think of that . 
No , you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on the water ; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you do n't think to yourself how fast _you're_ going , but you catch your breath and think , my ! 
how that snag 's tearing along . 
If you think it ai n't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night , you try it once -- you 'll see . 
Next , for about a half an hour , I whoops now and then ; at last I hears the answer a long ways off , and tries to follow it , but I could n't do it , and directly I judged I 'd got into a nest of towheads , for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me -- sometimes just a narrow channel between , and some that I could n't see I knowed was there because I 'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks . 
Well , I war n't long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads ; and I only tried to chase them a little while , anyway , because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern . 
You never knowed a sound dodge around so , and swap places so quick and so much . 
I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times , to keep from knocking the islands out of the river ; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then , or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing -- it was floating a little faster than what I was . 
Well , I seemed to be in the open river again by and by , but I couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres . 
I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag , maybe , and it was all up with him . 
I was good and tired , so I laid down in the canoe and said I would n't bother no more . 
I didn't want to go to sleep , of course ; but I was so sleepy I could n't help it ; so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap . 
But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap , for when I waked up the stars was shining bright , the fog was all gone , and I was spinning down a big bend stern first . 
First I did n't know where I was ; I thought I was dreaming ; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week . 
It was a monstrous big river here , with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks ; just a solid wall , as well as I could see by the stars . 
I looked away down-stream , and seen a black speck on the water . 
I took after it ; but when I got to it it war n't nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together . 
Then I see another speck , and chased that ; then another , and this time I was right . 
It was the raft . 
When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees , asleep , with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar . 
The other oar was smashed off , and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt . 
So she 'd had a rough time . 
I made fast and laid down under Jim 's nose on the raft , and began to gap , and stretch my fists out against Jim , and says : Hello , Jim , have I been asleep ? 
Why did n't you stir me up ? 
Goodness gracious , is dat you , Huck ? 
En you ain ' dead -- you ain' drownded -- you 's back agin ? 
It 's too good for true , honey , it 's too good for true . 
Lem me look at you chile , lem me feel o ' you . 
No , you ain' dead ! 
you 's back agin , 'live en soun ' , jis de same ole Huck -- de same ole Huck , thanks to goodness ! 
What 's the matter with you , Jim ? 
You been a-drinking ? 
Drinkin ' ? 
Has I ben a-drinkin ' ? 
Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin ' ? 
Well , then , what makes you talk so wild ? 
How does I talk wild ? 
_How_ ? 
Why , hai n't you been talking about my coming back , and all that stuff , as if I 'd been gone away ? 
Huck -- Huck Finn , you look me in de eye ; look me in de eye . 
_Hain't_ you ben gone away ? 
Gone away ? 
Why , what in the nation do you mean ? 
I hai n't been gone anywheres . 
Where would I go to ? 
Well , looky here , boss , dey 's sumf ' n wrong , dey is . 
Is I _me_ , or who _is_ I ? 
Is I heah , or whah _is_ I ? 
Now dat 's what I wants to know . 
Well , I think you 're here , plain enough , but I think you 're a tangle-headed old fool , Jim . 
I is , is I ? 
Well , you answer me dis : Did n't you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas ' to de tow-head ? 
No , I did n't . 
What tow-head ? 
I hai n't see no tow-head . 
You hai n't seen no towhead ? 
Looky here , did n't de line pull loose en de raf ' go a-hummin ' down de river , en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog ? 
What fog ? 
Why , de fog ! -- de fog dat 's been aroun ' all night . 
En did n't you whoop , en did n't I whoop , tell we got mix ' up in de islands en one un us got los ' en t'other one was jis ' as good as los ' , 'kase he didn ' know whah he wuz ? 
En did n't I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos ' git drownded ? 
Now ain ' dat so , boss -- ai n't it so ? 
You answer me dat . 
Well , this is too many for me , Jim . 
I hai n't seen no fog , nor no islands , nor no troubles , nor nothing . 
I been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago , and I reckon I done the same . 
You could n't a got drunk in that time , so of course you 've been dreaming . 
Dad fetch it , how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes ? 
Well , hang it all , you did dream it , because there did n't any of it happen . 
But , Huck , it 's all jis ' as plain to me as -- It do n't make no difference how plain it is ; there ai n't nothing in it . 
I know , because I 've been here all the time . 
Jim did n't say nothing for about five minutes , but set there studying over it . 
Then he says : Well , den , I reck ' n I did dream it , Huck ; but dog my cats ef it ain't de powerfullest dream I ever see . 
En I hai n't ever had no dream b'fo' dat 's tired me like dis one . 
Oh , well , that 's all right , because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes . 
But this one was a staving dream ; tell me all about it , Jim . 
So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through , just as it happened , only he painted it up considerable . 
Then he said he must start in and 'terpret it , because it was sent for a warning . 
He said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good , but the current was another man that would get us away from him . 
The whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then , and if we didn't try hard to make out to understand them they 'd just take us into bad luck , 'stead of keeping us out of it . 
The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks , but if we minded our business and did n't talk back and aggravate them , we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river , which was the free States , and would n't have no more trouble . 
It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft , but it was clearing up again now . 
Oh , well , that 's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes , Jim , I says ; but what does _these_ things stand for ? 
It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar . 
You could see them first-rate now . 
Jim looked at the trash , and then looked at me , and back at the trash again . 
He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he could n't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away . 
But when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling , and says : What do dey stan ' for ? 
I'se gwyne to tell you . 
When I got all wore out wid work , en wid de callin ' for you , en went to sleep , my heart wuz mos ' broke bekase you wuz los ' , en I didn ' k'yer no ' mo ' what become er me en de raf ' . 
En when I wake up en fine you back agin , all safe en soun ' , de tears come , en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo' foot , I 's so thankful . 
En all you wuz thinkin ' 'bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie . 
Dat truck dah is _trash_ ; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren 's en makes 'em ashamed . 
Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam , and went in there without saying anything but that . 
But that was enough . 
It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back . 
It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger ; but I done it , and I war n't ever sorry for it afterwards , neither . 
I did n't do him no more mean tricks , and I would n't done that one if I 'd a knowed it would make him feel that way . 
. 
WE slept most all day , and started out at night , a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession . 
She had four long sweeps at each end , so we judged she carried as many as thirty men , likely . 
She had five big wigwams aboard , wide apart , and an open camp fire in the middle , and a tall flag-pole at each end . 
There was a power of style about her . 
It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that . 
We went drifting down into a big bend , and the night clouded up and got hot . 
The river was very wide , and was walled with solid timber on both sides ; you could n't see a break in it hardly ever , or a light . 
We talked about Cairo , and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it . 
I said likely we would n't , because I had heard say there war n't but about a dozen houses there , and if they did n't happen to have them lit up , how was we going to know we was passing a town ? 
Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there , that would show . 
But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again . 
That disturbed Jim -- and me too . 
So the question was , what to do ? 
I said , paddle ashore the first time a light showed , and tell them pap was behind , coming along with a trading-scow , and was a green hand at the business , and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo . 
Jim thought it was a good idea , so we took a smoke on it and waited . 
There war n't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town , and not pass it without seeing it . 
He said he 'd be mighty sure to see it , because he 'd be a free man the minute he seen it , but if he missed it he 'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom . 
Every little while he jumps up and says : Dah she is ? 
But it war n't . 
It was Jack-o'-lanterns , or lightning bugs ; so he set down again , and went to watching , same as before . 
Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom . 
Well , I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish , too , to hear him , because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free -- and who was to blame for it ? 
Why , _me_ . 
I could n't get that out of my conscience , no how nor no way . 
It got to troubling me so I couldn't rest ; I could n't stay still in one place . 
It had n't ever come home to me before , what this thing was that I was doing . 
But now it did ; and it stayed with me , and scorched me more and more . 
I tried to make out to myself that I war n't to blame , because I did n't run Jim off from his rightful owner ; but it war n't no use , conscience up and says , every time , But you knowed he was running for his freedom , and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody . 
That was so -- I could n't get around that noway . 
That was where it pinched . 
Conscience says to me , What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word ? 
What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean ? 
Why , she tried to learn you your book , she tried to learn you your manners , she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how . 
_That's_ what she done . 
I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead . 
I fidgeted up and down the raft , abusing myself to myself , and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me . 
We neither of us could keep still . 
Every time he danced around and says , Dah 's Cairo ! 
it went through me like a shot , and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness . 
Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself . 
He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent , and when he got enough he would buy his wife , which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived ; and then they would both work to buy the two children , and if their master would n't sell them , they 'd get an Ab'litionist to go and steal them . 
It most froze me to hear such talk . 
He would n't ever dared to talk such talk in his life before . 
Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free . 
It was according to the old saying , Give a nigger an inch and he 'll take an ell . 
Thinks I , this is what comes of my not thinking . 
Here was this nigger , which I had as good as helped to run away , coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children -- children that belonged to a man I did n't even know ; a man that had n't ever done me no harm . 
I was sorry to hear Jim say that , it was such a lowering of him . 
My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever , until at last I says to it , Let up on me -- it ai n't too late yet -- I 'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell . 
I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off . 
All my troubles was gone . 
I went to looking out sharp for a light , and sort of singing to myself . 
By and by one showed . 
Jim sings out : We 's safe , Huck , we 's safe ! 
Jump up and crack yo ' heels ! 
Dat 's de good ole Cairo at las ' , I jis knows it ! 
I says : I 'll take the canoe and go and see , Jim . 
It might n't be , you know . 
He jumped and got the canoe ready , and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on , and give me the paddle ; and as I shoved off , he says : Pooty soon I 'll be a-shout ' n ' for joy , en I 'll say , it 's all on accounts o ' Huck ; I 's a free man , en I could n't ever ben free ef it hadn ' ben for Huck ; Huck done it . 
Jim wo n't ever forgit you , Huck ; you 's de bes ' fren ' Jim 's ever had ; en you 's de _only_ fren ' ole Jim's got now . 
I was paddling off , all in a sweat to tell on him ; but when he says this , it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me . 
I went along slow then , and I war n't right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I war n't . 
When I was fifty yards off , Jim says : Dah you goes , de ole true Huck ; de on ' y white genlman dat ever kep ' his promise to ole Jim . 
Well , I just felt sick . 
But I says , I _got_ to do it -- I ca n't get _out_ of it . 
Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns , and they stopped and I stopped . 
One of them says : What 's that yonder ? 
A piece of a raft , I says . 
Do you belong on it ? 
Yes , sir . 
Any men on it ? 
Only one , sir . 
Well , there 's five niggers run off to-night up yonder , above the head of the bend . 
Is your man white or black ? 
I did n't answer up prompt . 
I tried to , but the words would n't come . 
I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it , but I war n't man enough -- had n't the spunk of a rabbit . 
I see I was weakening ; so I just give up trying , and up and says : He 's white . 
I reckon we 'll go and see for ourselves . 
I wish you would , says I , because it 's pap that 's there , and maybe you 'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is . 
He 's sick -- and so is mam and Mary Ann . 
Oh , the devil ! 
we 're in a hurry , boy . 
But I s'pose we 've got to . 
Come , buckle to your paddle , and let 's get along . 
I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars . 
When we had made a stroke or two , I says : Pap 'll be mighty much obleeged to you , I can tell you . 
Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore , and I ca n't do it by myself . 
Well , that 's infernal mean . 
Odd , too . 
Say , boy , what 's the matter with your father ? 
It 's the -- a -- the -- well , it ai n't anything much . 
They stopped pulling . 
It war n't but a mighty little ways to the raft now . 
One says : Boy , that 's a lie . 
What _is_ the matter with your pap ? 
Answer up square now , and it 'll be the better for you . 
I will , sir , I will , honest -- but do n't leave us , please . 
It's the -- the -- Gentlemen , if you 'll only pull ahead , and let me heave you the headline , you wo n't have to come a-near the raft -- please do . 
Set her back , John , set her back ! 
says one . 
They backed water . 
Keep away , boy -- keep to looard . 
Confound it , I just expect the wind has blowed it to us . 
Your pap 's got the small-pox , and you know it precious well . 
Why did n't you come out and say so ? 
Do you want to spread it all over ? 
Well , says I , a-blubbering , I 've told everybody before , and they just went away and left us . 
Poor devil , there 's something in that . 
We are right down sorry for you , but we -- well , hang it , we do n't want the small-pox , you see . 
Look here , I 'll tell you what to do . 
Do n't you try to land by yourself , or you 'll smash everything to pieces . 
You float along down about twenty miles , and you 'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river . 
It will be long after sun-up then , and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever . 
Do n't be a fool again , and let people guess what is the matter . 
Now we 're trying to do you a kindness ; so you just put twenty miles between us , that 's a good boy . 
It would n't do any good to land yonder where the light is -- it 's only a wood-yard . 
Say , I reckon your father 's poor , and I 'm bound to say he's in pretty hard luck . 
Here , I 'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board , and you get it when it floats by . 
I feel mighty mean to leave you ; but my kingdom ! 
it wo n't do to fool with small-pox , do n't you see ? 
Hold on , Parker , says the other man , here 's a twenty to put on the board for me . 
Good-bye , boy ; you do as Mr. Parker told you , and you'll be all right . 
That 's so , my boy -- good-bye , good-bye . 
If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them , and you can make some money by it . 
Good-bye , sir , says I ; I wo n't let no runaway niggers get by me if I can help it . 
They went off and I got aboard the raft , feeling bad and low , because I knowed very well I had done wrong , and I see it war n't no use for me to try to learn to do right ; a body that do n't get _started_ right when he 's little ai n't got no show -- when the pinch comes there ai n't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work , and so he gets beat . 
Then I thought a minute , and says to myself , hold on ; s'pose you 'd a done right and give Jim up , would you felt better than what you do now ? 
No , says I , I 'd feel bad -- I 'd feel just the same way I do now . 
Well , then , says I , what 's the use you learning to do right when it 's troublesome to do right and ai n't no trouble to do wrong , and the wages is just the same ? 
I was stuck . 
I could n't answer that . 
So I reckoned I would n't bother no more about it , but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time . 
I went into the wigwam ; Jim war n't there . 
I looked all around ; he war n't anywhere . 
I says : Jim ! 
Here I is , Huck . 
Is dey out o ' sight yit ? 
Do n't talk loud . 
He was in the river under the stern oar , with just his nose out . 
I told him they were out of sight , so he come aboard . 
He says : I was a-listenin ' to all de talk , en I slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho ' if dey come aboard . 
Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf ' agin when dey was gone . 
But lawsy , how you did fool 'em , Huck ! 
Dat _wuz_ de smartes ' dodge ! 
I tell you , chile , I'spec it save ' ole Jim -- ole Jim ai n't going to forgit you for dat , honey . 
Then we talked about the money . 
It was a pretty good raise -- twenty dollars apiece . 
Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now , and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States . 
He said twenty mile more war n't far for the raft to go , but he wished we was already there . 
Towards daybreak we tied up , and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good . 
Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles , and getting all ready to quit rafting . 
That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend . 
I went off in the canoe to ask about it . 
Pretty soon I found a man out in the river with a skiff , setting a trot-line . 
I ranged up and says : Mister , is that town Cairo ? 
Cairo ? 
no . 
You must be a blame ' fool . 
What town is it , mister ? 
If you want to know , go and find out . 
If you stay here botherin' around me for about a half a minute longer you 'll get something you wo n't want . 
I paddled to the raft . 
Jim was awful disappointed , but I said never mind , Cairo would be the next place , I reckoned . 
We passed another town before daylight , and I was going out again ; but it was high ground , so I did n't go . 
No high ground about Cairo , Jim said . 
I had forgot it . 
We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank . 
I begun to suspicion something . 
So did Jim . 
I says : Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night . 
He says : Doan ' le 's talk about it , Huck . 
Po ' niggers ca n't have no luck . 
I awluz 'spected dat rattlesnake-skin war n't done wid its work . 
I wish I 'd never seen that snake-skin , Jim -- I do wish I 'd never laid eyes on it . 
It ai n't yo ' fault , Huck ; you didn ' know . 
Do n't you blame yo'self 'bout it . 
When it was daylight , here was the clear Ohio water inshore , sure enough , and outside was the old regular Muddy ! 
So it was all up with Cairo . 
We talked it all over . 
It would n't do to take to the shore ; we couldn't take the raft up the stream , of course . 
There war n't no way but to wait for dark , and start back in the canoe and take the chances . 
So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket , so as to be fresh for the work , and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone ! 
We did n't say a word for a good while . 
There war n't anything to say . 
We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin ; so what was the use to talk about it ? 
It would only look like we was finding fault , and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck -- and keep on fetching it , too , till we knowed enough to keep still . 
By and by we talked about what we better do , and found there war n't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in . 
We war n't going to borrow it when there warn't anybody around , the way pap would do , for that might set people after us . 
So we shoved out after dark on the raft . 
Anybody that do n't believe yet that it 's foolishness to handle a snake-skin , after all that that snake-skin done for us , will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us . 
The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore . 
But we did n't see no rafts laying up ; so we went along during three hours and more . 
Well , the night got gray and ruther thick , which is the next meanest thing to fog . 
You ca n't tell the shape of the river , and you ca n't see no distance . 
It got to be very late and still , and then along comes a steamboat up the river . 
We lit the lantern , and judged she would see it . 
Up-stream boats did n't generly come close to us ; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs ; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river . 
We could hear her pounding along , but we did n't see her good till she was close . 
She aimed right for us . 
Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching ; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep , and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs , and thinks he 's mighty smart . 
Well , here she comes , and we said she was going to try and shave us ; but she did n't seem to be sheering off a bit . 
She was a big one , and she was coming in a hurry , too , looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it ; but all of a sudden she bulged out , big and scary , with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth , and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us . 
There was a yell at us , and a jingling of bells to stop the engines , a powwow of cussing , and whistling of steam -- and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other , she come smashing straight through the raft . 
I dived -- and I aimed to find the bottom , too , for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me , and I wanted it to have plenty of room . 
I could always stay under water a minute ; this time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half . 
Then I bounced for the top in a hurry , for I was nearly busting . 
I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose , and puffed a bit . 
Of course there was a booming current ; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them , for they never cared much for raftsmen ; so now she was churning along up the river , out of sight in the thick weather , though I could hear her . 
I sung out for Jim about a dozen times , but I did n't get any answer ; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was treading water , and struck out for shore , shoving it ahead of me . 
But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore , which meant that I was in a crossing ; so I changed off and went that way . 
It was one of these long , slanting , two-mile crossings ; so I was a good long time in getting over . 
I made a safe landing , and clumb up the bank . 
I could n't see but a little ways , but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more , and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it . 
I was going to rush by and get away , but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me , and I knowed better than to move another peg . 
. 
IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out , and says : Be done , boys ! 
Who 's there ? 
I says : It 's me . 
Who 's me ? 
George Jackson , sir . 
What do you want ? 
I do n't want nothing , sir . 
I only want to go along by , but the dogs wo n't let me . 
What are you prowling around here this time of night for -- hey ? 
I war n't prowling around , sir , I fell overboard off of the steamboat . 
Oh , you did , did you ? 
Strike a light there , somebody . 
What did you say your name was ? 
George Jackson , sir . 
I 'm only a boy . 
Look here , if you 're telling the truth you need n't be afraid -- nobody'll hurt you . 
But do n't try to budge ; stand right where you are . 
Rouse out Bob and Tom , some of you , and fetch the guns . 
George Jackson , is there anybody with you ? 
No , sir , nobody . 
I heard the people stirring around in the house now , and see a light . 
The man sung out : Snatch that light away , Betsy , you old fool -- ai n't you got any sense ? 
Put it on the floor behind the front door . 
Bob , if you and Tom are ready , take your places . 
All ready . 
Now , George Jackson , do you know the Shepherdsons ? 
No , sir ; I never heard of them . 
Well , that may be so , and it may n't . 
Now , all ready . 
Step forward , George Jackson . 
And mind , do n't you hurry -- come mighty slow . 
If there's anybody with you , let him keep back -- if he shows himself he 'll be shot . 
Come along now . 
Come slow ; push the door open yourself -- just enough to squeeze in , d ' you hear ? 
I did n't hurry ; I could n't if I 'd a wanted to . 
I took one slow step at a time and there war n't a sound , only I thought I could hear my heart . 
The dogs were as still as the humans , but they followed a little behind me . 
When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting . 
I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said , There , that 's enough -- put your head in . 
I done it , but I judged they would take it off . 
The candle was on the floor , and there they all was , looking at me , and me at them , for about a quarter of a minute : Three big men with guns pointed at me , which made me wince , I tell you ; the oldest , gray and about sixty , the other two thirty or more -- all of them fine and handsome -- and the sweetest old gray-headed lady , and back of her two young women which I could n't see right well . 
The old gentleman says : There ; I reckon it 's all right . 
Come in . 
As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it , and told the young men to come in with their guns , and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor , and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows -- there war n't none on the side . 
They held the candle , and took a good look at me , and all said , Why , _he_ ai n't a Shepherdson -- no , there ai n't any Shepherdson about him . 
Then the old man said he hoped I would n't mind being searched for arms , because he did n't mean no harm by it -- it was only to make sure . 
So he did n't pry into my pockets , but only felt outside with his hands , and said it was all right . 
He told me to make myself easy and at home , and tell all about myself ; but the old lady says : Why , bless you , Saul , the poor thing 's as wet as he can be ; and don't you reckon it may be he 's hungry ? 
True for you , Rachel -- I forgot . 
So the old lady says : Betsy ( this was a nigger woman ) , you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can , poor thing ; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck and tell him -- oh , here he is himself . 
Buck , take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that 's dry . 
Buck looked about as old as me -- thirteen or fourteen or along there , though he was a little bigger than me . 
He had n't on anything but a shirt , and he was very frowzy-headed . 
He came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes , and he was dragging a gun along with the other one . 
He says : Ai n't they no Shepherdsons around ? 
They said , no , 't was a false alarm . 
Well , he says , if they 'd a ben some , I reckon I 'd a got one . 
They all laughed , and Bob says : Why , Buck , they might have scalped us all , you 've been so slow in coming . 
Well , nobody come after me , and it ai n't right I 'm always kept down ; I do n't get no show . 
Never mind , Buck , my boy , says the old man , you 'll have show enough , all in good time , do n't you fret about that . 
Go 'long with you now , and do as your mother told you . 
When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his , and I put them on . 
While I was at it he asked me what my name was , but before I could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday , and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went out . 
I said I did n't know ; I had n't heard about it before , no way . 
Well , guess , he says . 
How 'm I going to guess , says I , when I never heard tell of it before ? 
But you can guess , ca n't you ? 
It 's just as easy . 
_Which_ candle ? 
I says . 
Why , any candle , he says . 
I do n't know where he was , says I ; where was he ? 
Why , he was in the _dark_ ! 
That 's where he was ! 
Well , if you knowed where he was , what did you ask me for ? 
Why , blame it , it 's a riddle , do n't you see ? 
Say , how long are you going to stay here ? 
You got to stay always . 
We can just have booming times -- they do n't have no school now . 
Do you own a dog ? 
I 've got a dog -- and he 'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in . 
Do you like to comb up Sundays , and all that kind of foolishness ? 
You bet I do n't , but ma she makes me . 
Confound these ole britches ! 
I reckon I 'd better put 'em on , but I 'd ruther not , it 's so warm . 
Are you all ready ? 
All right . 
Come along , old hoss . 
Cold corn-pone , cold corn-beef , butter and buttermilk -- that is what they had for me down there , and there ai n't nothing better that ever I've come across yet . 
Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes , except the nigger woman , which was gone , and the two young women . 
They all smoked and talked , and I eat and talked . 
The young women had quilts around them , and their hair down their backs . 
They all asked me questions , and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw , and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more , and Bill went to hunt them and he war n't heard of no more , and Tom and Mort died , and then there war n't nobody but just me and pap left , and he was just trimmed down to nothing , on account of his troubles ; so when he died I took what there was left , because the farm did n't belong to us , and started up the river , deck passage , and fell overboard ; and that was how I come to be here . 
So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it . 
Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed , and I went to bed with Buck , and when I waked up in the morning , drat it all , I had forgot what my name was . 
So I laid there about an hour trying to think , and when Buck waked up I says : Can you spell , Buck ? 
Yes , he says . 
I bet you ca n't spell my name , says I. I bet you what you dare I can , says he . 
All right , says I , go ahead . 
G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n -- there now , he says . 
Well , says I , you done it , but I did n't think you could . 
It ai n't no slouch of a name to spell -- right off without studying . 
I set it down , private , because somebody might want _me_ to spell it next , and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it . 
It was a mighty nice family , and a mighty nice house , too . 
I hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style . 
It did n't have an iron latch on the front door , nor a wooden one with a buckskin string , but a brass knob to turn , the same as houses in town . 
There war n't no bed in the parlor , nor a sign of a bed ; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them . 
There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom , and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick ; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown , same as they do in town . 
They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log . 
There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece , with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front , and a round place in the middle of it for the sun , and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it . 
It was beautiful to hear that clock tick ; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape , she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out . 
They would n't took any money for her . 
Well , there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock , made out of something like chalk , and painted up gaudy . 
By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery , and a crockery dog by the other ; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked , but did n't open their mouths nor look different nor interested . 
They squeaked through underneath . 
There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things . 
On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it , which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is , but they war n't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk , or whatever it was , underneath . 
This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth , with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it , and a painted border all around . 
It come all the way from Philadelphia , they said . 
There was some books , too , piled up perfectly exact , on each corner of the table . 
One was a big family Bible full of pictures . 
One was Pilgrim 's Progress , about a man that left his family , it did n't say why . 
I read considerable in it now and then . 
The statements was interesting , but tough . 
Another was Friendship 's Offering , full of beautiful stuff and poetry ; but I didn't read the poetry . 
Another was Henry Clay 's Speeches , and another was Dr. Gunn 's Family Medicine , which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead . 
There was a hymn book , and a lot of other books . 
And there was nice split-bottom chairs , and perfectly sound , too -- not bagged down in the middle and busted , like an old basket . 
They had pictures hung on the walls -- mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes , and battles , and Highland Marys , and one called Signing the Declaration . 
There was some that they called crayons , which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old . 
They was different from any pictures I ever see before -- blacker , mostly , than is common . 
One was a woman in a slim black dress , belted small under the armpits , with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves , and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil , and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape , and very wee black slippers , like a chisel , and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow , under a weeping willow , and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule , and underneath the picture it said Shall I Never See Thee More Alas . 
Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head , and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back , and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up , and underneath the picture it said I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas . 
There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon , and tears running down her cheeks ; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it , and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth , and underneath the picture it said And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas . 
These was all nice pictures , I reckon , but I did n't somehow seem to take to them , because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods . 
Everybody was sorry she died , because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do , and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost . 
But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard . 
She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick , and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done , but she never got the chance . 
It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown , standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off , with her hair all down her back , and looking up to the moon , with the tears running down her face , and she had two arms folded across her breast , and two arms stretched out in front , and two more reaching up towards the moon -- and the idea was to see which pair would look best , and then scratch out all the other arms ; but , as I was saying , she died before she got her mind made up , and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room , and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it . 
Other times it was hid with a little curtain . 
The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face , but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery , seemed to me . 
This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive , and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer , and write poetry after them out of her own head . 
It was very good poetry . 
This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded : ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS , DEC'D And did young Stephen sicken , And did young Stephen die ? 
And did the sad hearts thicken , And did the mourners cry ? 
No ; such was not the fate of Young Stephen Dowling Bots ; Though sad hearts round him thickened , 'T was not from sickness ' shots . 
No whooping-cough did rack his frame , Nor measles drear with spots ; Not these impaired the sacred name Of Stephen Dowling Bots . 
Despised love struck not with woe That head of curly knots , Nor stomach troubles laid him low , Young Stephen Dowling Bots . 
O no . 
Then list with tearful eye , Whilst I his fate do tell . 
His soul did from this cold world fly By falling down a well . 
They got him out and emptied him ; Alas it was too late ; His spirit was gone for to sport aloft In the realms of the good and great . 
If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen , there ai n't no telling what she could a done by and by . 
Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing . 
She did n't ever have to stop to think . 
He said she would slap down a line , and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one , and go ahead . 
She war n't particular ; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful . 
Every time a man died , or a woman died , or a child died , she would be on hand with her tribute before he was cold . 
She called them tributes . 
The neighbors said it was the doctor first , then Emmeline , then the undertaker -- the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once , and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person 's name , which was Whistler . 
She war n't ever the same after that ; she never complained , but she kinder pined away and did not live long . 
Poor thing , many 's the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little . 
I liked all that family , dead ones and all , and war n't going to let anything come between us . 
Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive , and it did n't seem right that there war n't nobody to make some about her now she was gone ; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself , but I could n't seem to make it go somehow . 
They kept Emmeline's room trim and nice , and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive , and nobody ever slept there . 
The old lady took care of the room herself , though there was plenty of niggers , and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly . 
Well , as I was saying about the parlor , there was beautiful curtains on the windows : white , with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls , and cattle coming down to drink . 
There was a little old piano , too , that had tin pans in it , I reckon , and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing The Last Link is Broken and play The Battle of Prague on it . 
The walls of all the rooms was plastered , and most had carpets on the floors , and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside . 
It was a double house , and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored , and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day , and it was a cool , comfortable place . 
Nothing could n't be better . 
And war n't the cooking good , and just bushels of it too ! 
. 
COL. Grangerford was a gentleman , you see . 
He was a gentleman all over ; and so was his family . 
He was well born , as the saying is , and that 's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse , so the Widow Douglas said , and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town ; and pap he always said it , too , though he war n't no more quality than a mudcat himself . 
Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim , and had a darkish-paly complexion , not a sign of red in it anywheres ; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face , and he had the thinnest kind of lips , and the thinnest kind of nostrils , and a high nose , and heavy eyebrows , and the blackest kind of eyes , sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you , as you may say . 
His forehead was high , and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders . 
His hands was long and thin , and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it ; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it . 
He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it . 
There war n't no frivolishness about him , not a bit , and he war n't ever loud . 
He was as kind as he could be -- you could feel that , you know , and so you had confidence . 
Sometimes he smiled , and it was good to see ; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole , and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows , you wanted to climb a tree first , and find out what the matter was afterwards . 
He did n't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners -- everybody was always good-mannered where he was . 
Everybody loved to have him around , too ; he was sunshine most always -- I mean he made it seem like good weather . 
When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute , and that was enough ; there would n't nothing go wrong again for a week . 
When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day , and did n't set down again till they had set down . 
Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was , and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him , and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom 's and Bob 's was mixed , and then they bowed and said , Our duty to you , sir , and madam ; and _they_ bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you , and so they drank , all three , and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers , and give it to me and Buck , and we drank to the old people too . 
Bob was the oldest and Tom next -- tall , beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces , and long black hair and black eyes . 
They dressed in white linen from head to foot , like the old gentleman , and wore broad Panama hats . 
Then there was Miss Charlotte ; she was twenty-five , and tall and proud and grand , but as good as she could be when she war n't stirred up ; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks , like her father . 
She was beautiful . 
So was her sister , Miss Sophia , but it was a different kind . 
She was gentle and sweet like a dove , and she was only twenty . 
Each person had their own nigger to wait on them -- Buck too . 
My nigger had a monstrous easy time , because I war n't used to having anybody do anything for me , but Buck 's was on the jump most of the time . 
This was all there was of the family now , but there used to be more -- three sons ; they got killed ; and Emmeline that died . 
The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers . 
Sometimes a stack of people would come there , horseback , from ten or fifteen mile around , and stay five or six days , and have such junketings round about and on the river , and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes , and balls at the house nights . 
These people was mostly kinfolks of the family . 
The men brought their guns with them . 
It was a handsome lot of quality , I tell you . 
There was another clan of aristocracy around there -- five or six families -- mostly of the name of Shepherdson . 
They was as high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords . 
The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing , which was about two mile above our house ; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses . 
One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting , and heard a horse coming . 
We was crossing the road . 
Buck says : Quick ! 
Jump for the woods ! 
We done it , and then peeped down the woods through the leaves . 
Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road , setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier . 
He had his gun across his pommel . 
I had seen him before . 
It was young Harney Shepherdson . 
I heard Buck 's gun go off at my ear , and Harney 's hat tumbled off from his head . 
He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid . 
But we did n't wait . 
We started through the woods on a run . 
The woods war n't thick , so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet , and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun ; and then he rode away the way he come -- to get his hat , I reckon , but I could n't see . 
We never stopped running till we got home . 
The old gentleman 's eyes blazed a minute -- 't was pleasure , mainly , I judged -- then his face sort of smoothed down , and he says , kind of gentle : I do n't like that shooting from behind a bush . 
Why did n't you step into the road , my boy ? 
The Shepherdsons do n't , father . 
They always take advantage . 
Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling his tale , and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped . 
The two young men looked dark , but never said nothing . 
Miss Sophia she turned pale , but the color come back when she found the man war n't hurt . 
Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by ourselves , I says : Did you want to kill him , Buck ? 
Well , I bet I did . 
What did he do to you ? 
Him ? 
He never done nothing to me . 
Well , then , what did you want to kill him for ? 
Why , nothing -- only it 's on account of the feud . 
What 's a feud ? 
Why , where was you raised ? 
Do n't you know what a feud is ? 
Never heard of it before -- tell me about it . 
Well , says Buck , a feud is this way : A man has a quarrel with another man , and kills him ; then that other man 's brother kills _him_ ; then the other brothers , on both sides , goes for one another ; then the _cousins_ chip in -- and by and by everybody 's killed off , and there ain't no more feud . 
But it 's kind of slow , and takes a long time . 
Has this one been going on long , Buck ? 
Well , I should _reckon_ ! 
It started thirty year ago , or som'ers along there . 
There was trouble 'bout something , and then a lawsuit to settle it ; and the suit went agin one of the men , and so he up and shot the man that won the suit -- which he would naturally do , of course . 
Anybody would . 
What was the trouble about , Buck ? -- land ? 
I reckon maybe -- I do n't know . 
Well , who done the shooting ? 
Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson ? 
Laws , how do I know ? 
It was so long ago . 
Do n't anybody know ? 
Oh , yes , pa knows , I reckon , and some of the other old people ; but they do n't know now what the row was about in the first place . 
Has there been many killed , Buck ? 
Yes ; right smart chance of funerals . 
But they do n't always kill . 
Pa's got a few buckshot in him ; but he do n't mind it 'cuz he do n't weigh much , anyway . 
Bob 's been carved up some with a bowie , and Tom 's been hurt once or twice . 
Has anybody been killed this year , Buck ? 
Yes ; we got one and they got one . 
'Bout three months ago my cousin Bud , fourteen year old , was riding through the woods on t'other side of the river , and did n't have no weapon with him , which was blame' foolishness , and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him , and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin ' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind ; and 'stead of jumping off and taking to the brush , Bud 'lowed he could out-run him ; so they had it , nip and tuck , for five mile or more , the old man a-gaining all the time ; so at last Bud seen it war n't any use , so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front , you know , and the old man he rode up and shot him down . 
But he did n't git much chance to enjoy his luck , for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out . 
I reckon that old man was a coward , Buck . 
I reckon he _warn't_ a coward . 
Not by a blame ' sight . 
There ai n't a coward amongst them Shepherdsons -- not a one . 
And there ai n't no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either . 
Why , that old man kep ' up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords , and come out winner . 
They was all a-horseback ; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile , and kep ' his horse before him to stop the bullets ; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man , and peppered away at him , and he peppered away at them . 
Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled , but the Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ home -- and one of 'em was dead , and another died the next day . 
No , sir ; if a body 's out hunting for cowards he do n't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons , becuz they do n't breed any of that _kind_ . 
Next Sunday we all went to church , about three mile , everybody a-horseback . 
The men took their guns along , so did Buck , and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall . 
The Shepherdsons done the same . 
It was pretty ornery preaching -- all about brotherly love , and such-like tiresomeness ; but everybody said it was a good sermon , and they all talked it over going home , and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination , and I do n't know what all , that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet . 
About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around , some in their chairs and some in their rooms , and it got to be pretty dull . 
Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep . 
I went up to our room , and judged I would take a nap myself . 
I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door , which was next to ours , and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft , and asked me if I liked her , and I said I did ; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody , and I said I would . 
Then she said she 'd forgot her Testament , and left it in the seat at church between two other books , and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her , and not say nothing to nobody . 
I said I would . 
So I slid out and slipped off up the road , and there war n't anybody at the church , except maybe a hog or two , for there war n't any lock on the door , and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it 's cool . 
If you notice , most folks do n't go to church only when they 've got to ; but a hog is different . 
Says I to myself , something 's up ; it ai n't natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament . 
So I give it a shake , and out drops a little piece of paper with HALF-PAST TWO wrote on it with a pencil . 
I ransacked it , but could n't find anything else . 
I could n't make anything out of that , so I put the paper in the book again , and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me . 
She pulled me in and shut the door ; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper , and as soon as she read it she looked glad ; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze , and said I was the best boy in the world , and not to tell anybody . 
She was mighty red in the face for a minute , and her eyes lighted up , and it made her powerful pretty . 
I was a good deal astonished , but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about , and she asked me if I had read it , and I said no , and she asked me if I could read writing , and I told her no , only coarse-hand , and then she said the paper war n't anything but a book-mark to keep her place , and I might go and play now . 
I went off down to the river , studying over this thing , and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind . 
When we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second , and then comes a-running , and says : Mars Jawge , if you 'll come down into de swamp I 'll show you a whole stack o ' water-moccasins . 
Thinks I , that 's mighty curious ; he said that yesterday . 
He oughter know a body do n't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for them . 
What is he up to , anyway ? 
So I says : All right ; trot ahead . 
I followed a half a mile ; then he struck out over the swamp , and waded ankle deep as much as another half-mile . 
We come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines , and he says : You shove right in dah jist a few steps , Mars Jawge ; dah 's whah dey is . 
I 's seed 'm befo ' ; I do n't k'yer to see 'em no mo ' . 
Then he slopped right along and went away , and pretty soon the trees hid him . 
I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines , and found a man laying there asleep -- and , by jings , it was my old Jim ! 
I waked him up , and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again , but it war n't . 
He nearly cried he was so glad , but he war n't surprised . 
Said he swum along behind me that night , and heard me yell every time , but das n't answer , because he did n't want nobody to pick _him_ up and take him into slavery again . 
Says he : I got hurt a little , en could n't swim fas ' , so I wuz a considable ways behine you towards de las ' ; when you landed I reck'ned I could ketch up wid you on de lan ' 'dout havin ' to shout at you , but when I see dat house I begin to go slow . 
I 'uz off too fur to hear what dey say to you -- I wuz 'fraid o ' de dogs ; but when it 'uz all quiet agin I knowed you 's in de house , so I struck out for de woods to wait for day . 
Early in de mawnin ' some er de niggers come along , gwyne to de fields , en dey tuk me en showed me dis place , whah de dogs ca n't track me on accounts o ' de water , en dey brings me truck to eat every night , en tells me how you 's a-gitt ' n along . 
Why did n't you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner , Jim ? 
Well , 'twar n't no use to 'sturb you , Huck , tell we could do sumfn -- but we 's all right now . 
I ben a-buyin ' pots en pans en vittles , as I got a chanst , en a-patchin ' up de raf ' nights when -- _What_ raft , Jim ? 
Our ole raf ' . 
You mean to say our old raft war n't smashed all to flinders ? 
No , she war n't . 
She was tore up a good deal -- one en ' of her was ; but dey war n't no great harm done , on ' y our traps was mos ' all los ' . 
Ef we hadn ' dive ' so deep en swum so fur under water , en de night hadn ' ben so dark , en we war n't so sk'yerd , en ben sich punkin-heads , as de sayin' is , we 'd a seed de raf ' . 
But it 's jis ' as well we did n't , 'kase now she 's all fixed up agin mos ' as good as new , en we 's got a new lot o' stuff , in de place o ' what 'uz los ' . 
Why , how did you get hold of the raft again , Jim -- did you catch her ? 
How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods ? 
No ; some er de niggers foun ' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben ' , en dey hid her in a crick 'mongst de willows , en dey wuz so much jawin ' 'bout which un 'um she b'long to de mos ' dat I come to heah 'bout it pooty soon , so I ups en settles de trouble by tellin ' 'um she do n't b'long to none uv um , but to you en me ; en I ast 'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman's propaty , en git a hid ' n for it ? 
Den I gin 'm ten cents apiece , en dey 'uz mighty well satisfied , en wisht some mo ' raf 's 'ud come along en make 'm rich agin . 
Dey 's mighty good to me , dese niggers is , en whatever I wants 'm to do fur me I doan ' have to ast 'm twice , honey . 
Dat Jack's a good nigger , en pooty smart . 
Yes , he is . 
He ai n't ever told me you was here ; told me to come , and he 'd show me a lot of water-moccasins . 
If anything happens _he_ ain't mixed up in it . 
He can say he never seen us together , and it 'll be the truth . 
I do n't want to talk much about the next day . 
I reckon I 'll cut it pretty short . 
I waked up about dawn , and was a-going to turn over and go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was -- did n't seem to be anybody stirring . 
That war n't usual . 
Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone . 
Well , I gets up , a-wondering , and goes down stairs -- nobody around ; everything as still as a mouse . 
Just the same outside . 
Thinks I , what does it mean ? 
Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack , and says : What 's it all about ? 
Says he : Do n't you know , Mars Jawge ? 
No , says I , I do n't . 
Well , den , Miss Sophia 's run off ! 
'deed she has . 
She run off in de night some time -- nobody do n't know jis ' when ; run off to get married to dat young Harney Shepherdson , you know -- leastways , so dey 'spec . 
De fambly foun ' it out 'bout half an hour ago -- maybe a little mo ' -- en ' I _tell_ you dey war n't no time los ' . 
Sich another hurryin ' up guns en hosses _you_ never see ! 
De women folks has gone for to stir up de relations , en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him 'fo ' he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia . 
I reck ' n dey 's gwyne to be mighty rough times . 
Buck went off 'thout waking me up . 
Well , I reck ' n he _did_ ! 
Dey war n't gwyne to mix you up in it . 
Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he 's gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust . 
Well , dey 'll be plenty un 'm dah , I reck ' n , en you bet you he 'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst . 
I took up the river road as hard as I could put . 
By and by I begin to hear guns a good ways off . 
When I come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place , and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach , and watched . 
There was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree , and first I was going to hide behind that ; but maybe it was luckier I did n't . 
There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store , cussing and yelling , and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing ; but they could n't come it . 
Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at . 
The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile , so they could watch both ways . 
By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling . 
They started riding towards the store ; then up gets one of the boys , draws a steady bead over the wood-rank , and drops one of them out of his saddle . 
All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store ; and that minute the two boys started on the run . 
They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed . 
Then the men see them , and jumped on their horses and took out after them . 
They gained on the boys , but it did n't do no good , the boys had too good a start ; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree , and slipped in behind it , and so they had the bulge on the men again . 
One of the boys was Buck , and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old . 
The men ripped around awhile , and then rode away . 
As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him . 
He did n't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first . 
He was awful surprised . 
He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again ; said they was up to some devilment or other -- would n't be gone long . 
I wished I was out of that tree , but I das n't come down . 
Buck begun to cry and rip , and 'lowed that him and his cousin Joe ( that was the other young chap ) would make up for this day yet . 
He said his father and his two brothers was killed , and two or three of the enemy . 
Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush . 
Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations -- the Shepherdsons was too strong for them . 
I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia . 
He said they 'd got across the river and was safe . 
I was glad of that ; but the way Buck did take on because he did n't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him -- I hai n't ever heard anything like it . 
All of a sudden , bang ! 
bang ! 
bang ! 
goes three or four guns -- the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses ! 
The boys jumped for the river -- both of them hurt -- and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out , Kill them , kill them ! 
It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree . 
I ai n't a-going to tell _all_ that happened -- it would make me sick again if I was to do that . 
I wished I had n't ever come ashore that night to see such things . 
I ai n't ever going to get shut of them -- lots of times I dream about them . 
I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark , afraid to come down . 
Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods ; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns ; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on . 
I was mighty downhearted ; so I made up my mind I would n't ever go anear that house again , because I reckoned I was to blame , somehow . 
I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off ; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted , and then maybe he would a locked her up , and this awful mess would n't ever happened . 
When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece , and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water , and tugged at them till I got them ashore ; then I covered up their faces , and got away as quick as I could . 
I cried a little when I was covering up Buck 's face , for he was mighty good to me . 
It was just dark now . 
I never went near the house , but struck through the woods and made for the swamp . 
Jim war n't on his island , so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick , and crowded through the willows , red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country . 
The raft was gone ! 
My souls , but I was scared ! 
I could n't get my breath for most a minute . 
Then I raised a yell . 
A voice not twenty-five foot from me says : Good lan ' ! 
is dat you , honey ? 
Doan ' make no noise . 
It was Jim 's voice -- nothing ever sounded so good before . 
I run along the bank a piece and got aboard , and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me , he was so glad to see me . 
He says : Laws bless you , chile , I 'uz right down sho ' you 's dead agin . 
Jack's been heah ; he say he reck ' n you 's ben shot , kase you didn ' come home no mo ' ; so I 's jes ' dis minute a startin ' de raf ' down towards de mouf er de crick , so 's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead . 
Lawsy , I 's mighty glad to git you back again , honey . 
I says : All right -- that 's mighty good ; they wo n't find me , and they 'll think I 've been killed , and floated down the river -- there 's something up there that 'll help them think so -- so do n't you lose no time , Jim , but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can . 
I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi . 
Then we hung up our signal lantern , and judged that we was free and safe once more . 
I had n't had a bite to eat since yesterday , so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk , and pork and cabbage and greens -- there ai n't nothing in the world so good when it 's cooked right -- and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a good time . 
I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds , and so was Jim to get away from the swamp . 
We said there war n't no home like a raft , after all . 
Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery , but a raft do n't . 
You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft . 
. 
TWO or three days and nights went by ; I reckon I might say they swum by , they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely . 
Here is the way we put in the time . 
It was a monstrous big river down there -- sometimes a mile and a half wide ; we run nights , and laid up and hid daytimes ; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up -- nearly always in the dead water under a towhead ; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows , and hid the raft with them . 
Then we set out the lines . 
Next we slid into the river and had a swim , so as to freshen up and cool off ; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep , and watched the daylight come . 
Not a sound anywheres -- perfectly still -- just like the whole world was asleep , only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering , maybe . 
The first thing to see , looking away over the water , was a kind of dull line -- that was the woods on t'other side ; you could n't make nothing else out ; then a pale place in the sky ; then more paleness spreading around ; then the river softened up away off , and war n't black any more , but gray ; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away -- trading scows , and such things ; and long black streaks -- rafts ; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking ; or jumbled up voices , it was so still , and sounds come so far ; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there 's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way ; and you see the mist curl up off of the water , and the east reddens up , and the river , and you make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods , away on the bank on t'other side of the river , being a woodyard , likely , and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres ; then the nice breeze springs up , and comes fanning you from over there , so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers ; but sometimes not that way , because they 've left dead fish laying around , gars and such , and they do get pretty rank ; and next you 've got the full day , and everything smiling in the sun , and the song-birds just going it ! 
A little smoke could n't be noticed now , so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast . 
And afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river , and kind of lazy along , and by and by lazy off to sleep . 
Wake up by and by , and look to see what done it , and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream , so far off towards the other side you could n't tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern-wheel or side-wheel ; then for about an hour there would n't be nothing to hear nor nothing to see -- just solid lonesomeness . 
Next you 'd see a raft sliding by , away off yonder , and maybe a galoot on it chopping , because they 're most always doing it on a raft ; you 'd see the axe flash and come down -- you do n't hear nothing ; you see that axe go up again , and by the time it 's above the man 's head then you hear the _k'chunk_ ! -- it had took all that time to come over the water . 
So we would put in the day , lazying around , listening to the stillness . 
Once there was a thick fog , and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats would n't run over them . 
A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing -- heard them plain ; but we could n't see no sign of them ; it made you feel crawly ; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air . 
Jim said he believed it was spirits ; but I says : No ; spirits would n't say , 'Dern the dern fog . ' 
Soon as it was night out we shoved ; when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone , and let her float wherever the current wanted her to ; then we lit the pipes , and dangled our legs in the water , and talked about all kinds of things -- we was always naked , day and night , whenever the mosquitoes would let us -- the new clothes Buck 's folks made for me was too good to be comfortable , and besides I did n't go much on clothes , nohow . 
Sometimes we 'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time . 
Yonder was the banks and the islands , across the water ; and maybe a spark -- which was a candle in a cabin window ; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two -- on a raft or a scow , you know ; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts . 
It 's lovely to live on a raft . 
We had the sky up there , all speckled with stars , and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them , and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened . 
Jim he allowed they was made , but I allowed they happened ; I judged it would have took too long to _make_ so many . 
Jim said the moon could a _laid_ them ; well , that looked kind of reasonable , so I did n't say nothing against it , because I 've seen a frog lay most as many , so of course it could be done . 
We used to watch the stars that fell , too , and see them streak down . 
Jim allowed they 'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest . 
Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark , and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys , and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty ; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again ; and by and by her waves would get to us , a long time after she was gone , and joggle the raft a bit , and after that you would n't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how long , except maybe frogs or something . 
After midnight the people on shore went to bed , and then for two or three hours the shores was black -- no more sparks in the cabin windows . 
These sparks was our clock -- the first one that showed again meant morning was coming , so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away . 
One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore -- it was only two hundred yards -- and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods , to see if I could n't get some berries . 
Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick , here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it . 
I thought I was a goner , for whenever anybody was after anybody I judged it was _me_ -- or maybe Jim . 
I was about to dig out from there in a hurry , but they was pretty close to me then , and sung out and begged me to save their lives -- said they had n't been doing nothing , and was being chased for it -- said there was men and dogs a-coming . 
They wanted to jump right in , but I says : Do n't you do it . 
I do n't hear the dogs and horses yet ; you 've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways ; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in -- that 'll throw the dogs off the scent . 
They done it , and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead , and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off , shouting . 
We heard them come along towards the crick , but couldn't see them ; they seemed to stop and fool around a while ; then , as we got further and further away all the time , we could n't hardly hear them at all ; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river , everything was quiet , and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe . 
One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards , and had a bald head and very gray whiskers . 
He had an old battered-up slouch hat on , and a greasy blue woollen shirt , and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot-tops , and home-knit galluses -- no , he only had one . 
He had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm , and both of them had big , fat , ratty-looking carpet-bags . 
The other fellow was about thirty , and dressed about as ornery . 
After breakfast we all laid off and talked , and the first thing that come out was that these chaps did n't know one another . 
What got you into trouble ? 
says the baldhead to t'other chap . 
Well , I 'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth -- and it does take it off , too , and generly the enamel along with it -- but I stayed about one night longer than I ought to , and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town , and you told me they were coming , and begged me to help you to get off . 
So I told you I was expecting trouble myself , and would scatter out _with_ you . 
That 's the whole yarn -- what 's yourn ? 
Well , I 'd ben a-running ' a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week , and was the pet of the women folks , big and little , for I was makin ' it mighty warm for the rummies , I _tell_ you , and takin ' as much as five or six dollars a night -- ten cents a head , children and niggers free -- and business a-growin ' all the time , when somehow or another a little report got around last night that I had a way of puttin ' in my time with a private jug on the sly . 
A nigger rousted me out this mornin ' , and told me the people was getherin ' on the quiet with their dogs and horses , and they 'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour 's start , and then run me down if they could ; and if they got me they 'd tar and feather me and ride me on a rail , sure . 
I did n't wait for no breakfast -- I war n't hungry . 
Old man , said the young one , I reckon we might double-team it together ; what do you think ? 
I ai n't undisposed . 
What 's your line -- mainly ? 
Jour printer by trade ; do a little in patent medicines ; theater-actor -- tragedy , you know ; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there 's a chance ; teach singing-geography school for a change ; sling a lecture sometimes -- oh , I do lots of things -- most anything that comes handy , so it ai n't work . 
What 's your lay ? 
I 've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time . 
Layin ' on o' hands is my best holt -- for cancer and paralysis , and sich things ; and I k ' n tell a fortune pretty good when I 've got somebody along to find out the facts for me . 
Preachin 's my line , too , and workin ' camp-meetin 's , and missionaryin ' around . 
Nobody never said anything for a while ; then the young man hove a sigh and says : Alas ! 
What 're you alassin ' about ? 
says the bald-head . 
To think I should have lived to be leading such a life , and be degraded down into such company . 
And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag . 
Dern your skin , ai n't the company good enough for you ? 
says the baldhead , pretty pert and uppish . 
Yes , it _is_ good enough for me ; it 's as good as I deserve ; for who fetched me so low when I was so high ? 
I did myself . 
I do n't blame _you_ , gentlemen -- far from it ; I do n't blame anybody . 
I deserve it all . 
Let the cold world do its worst ; one thing I know -- there 's a grave somewhere for me . 
The world may go on just as it 's always done , and take everything from me -- loved ones , property , everything ; but it ca n't take that . 
Some day I 'll lie down in it and forget it all , and my poor broken heart will be at rest . 
He went on a-wiping . 
Drot your pore broken heart , says the baldhead ; what are you heaving your pore broken heart at _us_ f ' r ? 
_we_ hai n't done nothing . 
No , I know you have n't . 
I ai n't blaming you , gentlemen . 
I brought myself down -- yes , I did it myself . 
It 's right I should suffer -- perfectly right -- I do n't make any moan . 
Brought you down from whar ? 
Whar was you brought down from ? 
Ah , you would not believe me ; the world never believes -- let it pass -- 't is no matter . 
The secret of my birth -- The secret of your birth ! 
Do you mean to say -- Gentlemen , says the young man , very solemn , I will reveal it to you , for I feel I may have confidence in you . 
By rights I am a duke ! 
Jim 's eyes bugged out when he heard that ; and I reckon mine did , too . 
Then the baldhead says : No ! 
you ca n't mean it ? 
Yes . 
My great-grandfather , eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater , fled to this country about the end of the last century , to breathe the pure air of freedom ; married here , and died , leaving a son , his own father dying about the same time . 
The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates -- the infant real duke was ignored . 
I am the lineal descendant of that infant -- I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater ; and here am I , forlorn , torn from my high estate , hunted of men , despised by the cold world , ragged , worn , heart-broken , and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft ! 
Jim pitied him ever so much , and so did I . 
We tried to comfort him , but he said it war n't much use , he could n't be much comforted ; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him , that would do him more good than most anything else ; so we said we would , if he would tell us how . 
He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him , and say Your Grace , or My Lord , or Your Lordship -- and he would n't mind it if we called him plain Bridgewater , which , he said , was a title anyway , and not a name ; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner , and do any little thing for him he wanted done . 
Well , that was all easy , so we done it . 
All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him , and says , Will yo ' Grace have some o ' dis or some o ' dat ? 
and so on , and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him . 
But the old man got pretty silent by and by -- did n't have much to say , and did n't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke . 
He seemed to have something on his mind . 
So , along in the afternoon , he says : Looky here , Bilgewater , he says , I 'm nation sorry for you , but you ai n't the only person that 's had troubles like that . 
No ? 
No you ai n't . 
You ai n't the only person that 's ben snaked down wrongfully out ' n a high place . 
Alas ! 
No , you ai n't the only person that 's had a secret of his birth . 
And , by jings , _he_ begins to cry . 
Hold ! 
What do you mean ? 
Bilgewater , kin I trust you ? 
says the old man , still sort of sobbing . 
To the bitter death ! 
He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it , and says , That secret of your being : speak ! 
Bilgewater , I am the late Dauphin ! 
You bet you , Jim and me stared this time . 
Then the duke says : You are what ? 
Yes , my friend , it is too true -- your eyes is lookin ' at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin , Looy the Seventeen , son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette . 
You ! 
At your age ! 
No ! 
You mean you 're the late Charlemagne ; you must be six or seven hundred years old , at the very least . 
Trouble has done it , Bilgewater , trouble has done it ; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude . 
Yes , gentlemen , you see before you , in blue jeans and misery , the wanderin ' , exiled , trampled-on , and sufferin ' rightful King of France . 
Well , he cried and took on so that me and Jim did n't know hardly what to do , we was so sorry -- and so glad and proud we 'd got him with us , too . 
So we set in , like we done before with the duke , and tried to comfort _him_ . 
But he said it war n't no use , nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good ; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights , and got down on one knee to speak to him , and always called him Your Majesty , and waited on him first at meals , and did n't set down in his presence till he asked them . 
So Jim and me set to majestying him , and doing this and that and t'other for him , and standing up till he told us we might set down . 
This done him heaps of good , and so he got cheerful and comfortable . 
But the duke kind of soured on him , and did n't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going ; still , the king acted real friendly towards him , and said the duke's great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by _his_ father , and was allowed to come to the palace considerable ; but the duke stayed huffy a good while , till by and by the king says : Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft , Bilgewater , and so what 's the use o ' your bein ' sour ? 
It 'll only make things oncomfortable . 
It ai n't my fault I war n't born a duke , it ai n't your fault you war n't born a king -- so what 's the use to worry ? 
Make the best o ' things the way you find 'em , says I -- that 's my motto . 
This ai n't no bad thing that we 've struck here -- plenty grub and an easy life -- come , give us your hand , duke , and le 's all be friends . 
The duke done it , and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it . 
It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it , because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft ; for what you want , above all things , on a raft , is for everybody to be satisfied , and feel right and kind towards the others . 
It did n't take me long to make up my mind that these liars war n't no kings nor dukes at all , but just low-down humbugs and frauds . 
But I never said nothing , never let on ; kept it to myself ; it 's the best way ; then you do n't have no quarrels , and do n't get into no trouble . 
If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes , I had n't no objections , 'long as it would keep peace in the family ; and it war n't no use to tell Jim , so I did n't tell him . 
If I never learnt nothing else out of pap , I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way . 
. 
THEY asked us considerable many questions ; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for , and laid by in the daytime instead of running -- was Jim a runaway nigger ? 
Says I : Goodness sakes ! 
would a runaway nigger run _south_ ? 
No , they allowed he would n't . 
I had to account for things some way , so I says : My folks was living in Pike County , in Missouri , where I was born , and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike . 
Pa , he 'lowed he 'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben , who 's got a little one-horse place on the river , forty-four mile below Orleans . 
Pa was pretty poor , and had some debts ; so when he 'd squared up there warn't nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger , Jim . 
That warn't enough to take us fourteen hundred mile , deck passage nor no other way . 
Well , when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day ; he ketched this piece of a raft ; so we reckoned we 'd go down to Orleans on it . 
Pa 's luck did n't hold out ; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night , and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel ; Jim and me come up all right , but pa was drunk , and Ike was only four years old , so they never come up no more . 
Well , for the next day or two we had considerable trouble , because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me , saying they believed he was a runaway nigger . 
We do n't run daytimes no more now ; nights they don't bother us . 
The duke says : Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to . 
I 'll think the thing over -- I 'll invent a plan that 'll fix it . 
We 'll let it alone for to-day , because of course we do n't want to go by that town yonder in daylight -- it might n't be healthy . 
Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain ; the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky , and the leaves was beginning to shiver -- it was going to be pretty ugly , it was easy to see that . 
So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam , to see what the beds was like . 
My bed was a straw tick better than Jim 's , which was a corn-shuck tick ; there 's always cobs around about in a shuck tick , and they poke into you and hurt ; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves ; it makes such a rustling that you wake up . 
Well , the duke allowed he would take my bed ; but the king allowed he would n't . 
He says : I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn-shuck bed war n't just fitten for me to sleep on . 
Your Grace 'll take the shuck bed yourself . 
Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute , being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them ; so we was pretty glad when the duke says : 'T is my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression . 
Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit ; I yield , I submit ; 't is my fate . 
I am alone in the world -- let me suffer ; can bear it . 
We got away as soon as it was good and dark . 
The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river , and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town . 
We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by -- that was the town , you know -- and slid by , about a half a mile out , all right . 
When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern ; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything ; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better ; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night . 
It was my watch below till twelve , but I would n't a turned in anyway if I 'd had a bed , because a body do n't see such a storm as that every day in the week , not by a long sight . 
My souls , how the wind did scream along ! 
And every second or two there 'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around , and you 'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain , and the trees thrashing around in the wind ; then comes a H-WHACK ! -- bum ! 
bum ! 
bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum -- and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away , and quit -- and then RIP comes another flash and another sockdolager . 
The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes , but I had n't any clothes on , and did n't mind . 
We did n't have no trouble about snags ; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them . 
I had the middle watch , you know , but I was pretty sleepy by that time , so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me ; he was always mighty good that way , Jim was . 
I crawled into the wigwam , but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there war n't no show for me ; so I laid outside -- I did n't mind the rain , because it was warm , and the waves war n't running so high now . 
About two they come up again , though , and Jim was going to call me ; but he changed his mind , because he reckoned they war n't high enough yet to do any harm ; but he was mistaken about that , for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard . 
It most killed Jim a-laughing . 
He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was , anyway . 
I took the watch , and Jim he laid down and snored away ; and by and by the storm let up for good and all ; and the first cabin-light that showed I rousted him out , and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day . 
The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast , and him and the duke played seven-up a while , five cents a game . 
Then they got tired of it , and allowed they would lay out a campaign , as they called it . 
The duke went down into his carpet-bag , and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud . 
One bill said , The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban , of Paris , would lecture on the Science of Phrenology at such and such a place , on the blank day of blank , at ten cents admission , and furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece . 
The duke said that was _him_ . 
In another bill he was the world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian , Garrick the Younger , of Drury Lane , London . 
In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things , like finding water and gold with a divining-rod , dissipating witch spells , and so on . 
By and by he says : But the histrionic muse is the darling . 
Have you ever trod the boards , Royalty ? 
No , says the king . 
You shall , then , before you 're three days older , Fallen Grandeur , says the duke . 
The first good town we come to we 'll hire a hall and do the sword fight in Richard III . 
and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet . 
How does that strike you ? 
I 'm in , up to the hub , for anything that will pay , Bilgewater ; but , you see , I do n't know nothing about play-actin ' , and hai n't ever seen much of it . 
I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace . 
Do you reckon you can learn me ? 
Easy ! 
All right . 
I 'm jist a-freezn ' for something fresh , anyway . 
Le's commence right away . 
So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was , and said he was used to being Romeo , so the king could be Juliet . 
But if Juliet 's such a young gal , duke , my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin ' to look oncommon odd on her , maybe . 
No , do n't you worry ; these country jakes wo n't ever think of that . 
Besides , you know , you 'll be in costume , and that makes all the difference in the world ; Juliet 's in a balcony , enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed , and she 's got on her night-gown and her ruffled nightcap . 
Here are the costumes for the parts . 
He got out two or three curtain-calico suits , which he said was meedyevil armor for Richard III . 
and t'other chap , and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match . 
The king was satisfied ; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spread-eagle way , prancing around and acting at the same time , to show how it had got to be done ; then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart . 
There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend , and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim ; so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing . 
The king allowed he would go , too , and see if he could n't strike something . 
We was out of coffee , so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some . 
When we got there there war n't nobody stirring ; streets empty , and perfectly dead and still , like Sunday . 
We found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard , and he said everybody that war n't too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting , about two mile back in the woods . 
The king got the directions , and allowed he 'd go and work that camp-meeting for all it was worth , and I might go , too . 
The duke said what he was after was a printing-office . 
We found it ; a little bit of a concern , up over a carpenter shop -- carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting , and no doors locked . 
It was a dirty , littered-up place , and had ink marks , and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them , all over the walls . 
The duke shed his coat and said he was all right now . 
So me and the king lit out for the camp-meeting . 
We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping , for it was a most awful hot day . 
There was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around . 
The woods was full of teams and wagons , hitched everywheres , feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep off the flies . 
There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches , where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell , and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck . 
The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds , only they was bigger and held crowds of people . 
The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs , with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs . 
They did n't have no backs . 
The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds . 
The women had on sun-bonnets ; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks , some gingham ones , and a few of the young ones had on calico . 
Some of the young men was barefooted , and some of the children did n't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt . 
Some of the old women was knitting , and some of the young folks was courting on the sly . 
The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn . 
He lined out two lines , everybody sung it , and it was kind of grand to hear it , there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way ; then he lined out two more for them to sing -- and so on . 
The people woke up more and more , and sung louder and louder ; and towards the end some begun to groan , and some begun to shout . 
Then the preacher begun to preach , and begun in earnest , too ; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other , and then a-leaning down over the front of it , with his arms and his body going all the time , and shouting his words out with all his might ; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and spread it open , and kind of pass it around this way and that , shouting , It 's the brazen serpent in the wilderness ! 
Look upon it and live ! 
And people would shout out , Glory ! -- A-a-_men_ ! 
And so he went on , and the people groaning and crying and saying amen : Oh , come to the mourners ' bench ! 
come , black with sin ! 
( _Amen_ ! ) 
come , sick and sore ! 
( _Amen_ ! ) 
come , lame and halt and blind ! 
( _Amen_ ! ) 
come , pore and needy , sunk in shame ! 
( _A-A-Men_ ! ) 
come , all that 's worn and soiled and suffering ! -- come with a broken spirit ! 
come with a contrite heart ! 
come in your rags and sin and dirt ! 
the waters that cleanse is free , the door of heaven stands open -- oh , enter in and be at rest ! 
( _A-A-Men_ ! 
_Glory , Glory Hallelujah ! _ ) And so on . 
You could n't make out what the preacher said any more , on account of the shouting and crying . 
Folks got up everywheres in the crowd , and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners' bench , with the tears running down their faces ; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd , they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw , just crazy and wild . 
Well , the first I knowed the king got a-going , and you could hear him over everybody ; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform , and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people , and he done it . 
He told them he was a pirate -- been a pirate for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean -- and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight , and he was home now to take out some fresh men , and thanks to goodness he 'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent , and he was glad of it ; it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him , because he was a changed man now , and happy for the first time in his life ; and , poor as he was , he was going to start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean , and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path ; for he could do it better than anybody else , being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean ; and though it would take him a long time to get there without money , he would get there anyway , and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him , Do n't you thank me , do n't you give me no credit ; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting , natural brothers and benefactors of the race , and that dear preacher there , the truest friend a pirate ever had ! 
And then he busted into tears , and so did everybody . 
Then somebody sings out , Take up a collection for him , take up a collection ! 
Well , a half a dozen made a jump to do it , but somebody sings out , Let _him_ pass the hat around ! 
Then everybody said it , the preacher too . 
So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes , and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there ; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls , with the tears running down their cheeks , would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by ; and he always done it ; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times -- and he was invited to stay a week ; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses , and said they 'd think it was an honor ; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he could n't do no good , and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates . 
When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents . 
And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky , too , that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods . 
The king said , take it all around , it laid over any day he 'd ever put in in the missionarying line . 
He said it war n't no use talking , heathens don't amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with . 
The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king come to show up , but after that he did n't think so so much . 
He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office -- horse bills -- and took the money , four dollars . 
And he had got in ten dollars ' worth of advertisements for the paper , which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance -- so they done it . 
The price of the paper was two dollars a year , but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance ; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual , but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it , and was going to run it for cash . 
He set up a little piece of poetry , which he made , himself , out of his own head -- three verses -- kind of sweet and saddish -- the name of it was , Yes , crush , cold world , this breaking heart -- and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper , and did n't charge nothing for it . 
Well , he took in nine dollars and a half , and said he 'd done a pretty square day 's work for it . 
Then he showed us another little job he 'd printed and had n't charged for , because it was for us . 
It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder , and $ 200 reward under it . 
The reading was all about Jim , and just described him to a dot . 
It said he run away from St. Jacques ' plantation , forty mile below New Orleans , last winter , and likely went north , and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses . 
Now , says the duke , after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to . 
Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope , and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river , and were too poor to travel on a steamboat , so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward . 
Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim , but it would n't go well with the story of us being so poor . 
Too much like jewelry . 
Ropes are the correct thing -- we must preserve the unities , as we say on the boards . 
We all said the duke was pretty smart , and there could n't be no trouble about running daytimes . 
We judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke 's work in the printing office was going to make in that little town ; then we could boom right along if we wanted to . 
We laid low and kept still , and never shoved out till nearly ten o'clock ; then we slid by , pretty wide away from the town , and didn't hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it . 
When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning , he says : Huck , does you reck ' n we gwyne to run acrost any mo ' kings on dis trip ? 
No , I says , I reckon not . 
Well , says he , dat 's all right , den . 
I doan ' mine one er two kings , but dat 's enough . 
Dis one 's powerful drunk , en de duke ain ' much better . 
I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French , so he could hear what it was like ; but he said he had been in this country so long , and had so much trouble , he 'd forgot it . 
. 
IT was after sun-up now , but we went right on and did n't tie up . 
The king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty ; but after they 'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal . 
After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft , and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches , and let his legs dangle in the water , so as to be comfortable , and lit his pipe , and went to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart . 
When he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together . 
The duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech ; and he made him sigh , and put his hand on his heart , and after a while he said he done it pretty well ; only , he says , you must n't bellow out _Romeo_ ! 
that way , like a bull -- you must say it soft and sick and languishy , so -- R-o-o-meo ! 
that is the idea ; for Juliet 's a dear sweet mere child of a girl , you know , and she does n't bray like a jackass . 
Well , next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths , and begun to practice the sword fight -- the duke called himself Richard III . 
; and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see . 
But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard , and after that they took a rest , and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they 'd had in other times along the river . 
After dinner the duke says : Well , Capet , we 'll want to make this a first-class show , you know , so I guess we 'll add a little more to it . 
We want a little something to answer encores with , anyway . 
What 's onkores , Bilgewater ? 
The duke told him , and then says : I 'll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor 's hornpipe ; and you -- well , let me see -- oh , I 've got it -- you can do Hamlet 's soliloquy . 
Hamlet 's which ? 
Hamlet 's soliloquy , you know ; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare . 
Ah , it 's sublime , sublime ! 
Always fetches the house . 
I have n't got it in the book -- I 've only got one volume -- but I reckon I can piece it out from memory . 
I 'll just walk up and down a minute , and see if I can call it back from recollection 's vaults . 
So he went to marching up and down , thinking , and frowning horrible every now and then ; then he would hoist up his eyebrows ; next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan ; next he would sigh , and next he 'd let on to drop a tear . 
It was beautiful to see him . 
By and by he got it . 
He told us to give attention . 
Then he strikes a most noble attitude , with one leg shoved forwards , and his arms stretched away up , and his head tilted back , looking up at the sky ; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth ; and after that , all through his speech , he howled , and spread around , and swelled up his chest , and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before . 
This is the speech -- I learned it , easy enough , while he was learning it to the king : To be , or not to be ; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of so long life ; For who would fardels bear , till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane , But that the fear of something after death Murders the innocent sleep , Great nature 's second course , And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of . 
There 's the respect must give us pause : Wake Duncan with thy knocking ! 
I would thou couldst ; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , The oppressor 's wrong , the proud man 's contumely , The law 's delay , and the quietus which his pangs might take . 
In the dead waste and middle of the night , when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black , But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns , Breathes forth contagion on the world , And thus the native hue of resolution , like the poor cat i ' the adage , Is sicklied o'er with care . 
And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops , With this regard their currents turn awry , And lose the name of action . 
'T is a consummation devoutly to be wished . 
But soft you , the fair Ophelia : Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws . 
But get thee to a nunnery & mdash ; go ! 
Well , the old man he liked that speech , and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first rate . 
It seemed like he was just born for it ; and when he had his hand in and was excited , it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off . 
The first chance we got , the duke he had some show bills printed ; and after that , for two or three days as we floated along , the raft was a most uncommon lively place , for there war n't nothing but sword-fighting and rehearsing -- as the duke called it -- going on all the time . 
One morning , when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw , we come in sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend ; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it , in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees , and all of us but Jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show . 
We struck it mighty lucky ; there was going to be a circus there that afternoon , and the country people was already beginning to come in , in all kinds of old shackly wagons , and on horses . 
The circus would leave before night , so our show would have a pretty good chance . 
The duke he hired the court house , and we went around and stuck up our bills . 
They read like this : Shaksperean Revival ! ! !

Then we went loafing around the town . 
The stores and houses was most all old shackly dried-up frame concerns that had n't ever been painted ; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts , so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed . 
The houses had little gardens around them , but they did n't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds , and sunflowers , and ash-piles , and old curled-up boots and shoes , and pieces of bottles , and rags , and played-out tin-ware . 
The fences was made of different kinds of boards , nailed on at different times ; and they leaned every which-way , and had gates that did n't generly have but one hinge -- a leather one . 
Some of the fences had been whitewashed , some time or another , but the duke said it was in Clumbus 's time , like enough . 
There was generly hogs in the garden , and people driving them out . 
All the stores was along one street . 
They had white domestic awnings in front , and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts . 
There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings , and loafers roosting on them all day long , whittling them with their Barlow knives ; and chawing tobacco , and gaping and yawning and stretching -- a mighty ornery lot . 
They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella , but did n't wear no coats nor waistcoats , they called one another Bill , and Buck , and Hank , and Joe , and Andy , and talked lazy and drawly , and used considerable many cuss words . 
There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post , and he most always had his hands in his britches-pockets , except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch . 
What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was : Gim me a chaw ' v tobacker , Hank . 
Cai n't ; I hai n't got but one chaw left . 
Ask Bill . 
Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw ; maybe he lies and says he ai n't got none . 
Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world , nor a chaw of tobacco of their own . 
They get all their chawing by borrowing ; they say to a fellow , I wisht you 'd len ' me a chaw , Jack , I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had -- which is a lie pretty much everytime ; it do n't fool nobody but a stranger ; but Jack ai n't no stranger , so he says : _You_ give him a chaw , did you ? 
So did your sister 's cat's grandmother . 
You pay me back the chaws you 've awready borry 'd off ' n me , Lafe Buckner , then I 'll loan you one or two ton of it , and wo n't charge you no back intrust , nuther . 
Well , I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst . 
Yes , you did -- 'bout six chaws . 
You borry 'd store tobacker and paid back nigger-head . 
Store tobacco is flat black plug , but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted . 
When they borrow a chaw they do n't generly cut it off with a knife , but set the plug in between their teeth , and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two ; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it 's handed back , and says , sarcastic : Here , gim me the _chaw_ , and you take the _plug_ . 
All the streets and lanes was just mud ; they war n't nothing else _but_ mud -- mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places , and two or three inches deep in _all_ the places . 
The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres . 
You 'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way , where folks had to walk around her , and she 'd stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her , and look as happy as if she was on salary . 
And pretty soon you 'd hear a loafer sing out , Hi ! 
_so_ boy ! 
sick him , Tige ! 
and away the sow would go , squealing most horrible , with a dog or two swinging to each ear , and three or four dozen more a-coming ; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight , and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise . 
Then they 'd settle back again till there was a dog fight . 
There could n't anything wake them up all over , and make them happy all over , like a dog fight -- unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him , or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death . 
On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank , and they was bowed and bent , and about ready to tumble in . 
The people had moved out of them . 
The bank was caved away under one corner of some others , and that corner was hanging over . 
People lived in them yet , but it was dangersome , because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time . 
Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer . 
Such a town as that has to be always moving back , and back , and back , because the river 's always gnawing at it . 
The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets , and more coming all the time . 
Families fetched their dinners with them from the country , and eat them in the wagons . 
There was considerable whisky drinking going on , and I seen three fights . 
By and by somebody sings out : Here comes old Boggs ! -- in from the country for his little old monthly drunk ; here he comes , boys ! 
All the loafers looked glad ; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs . 
One of them says : Wonder who he 's a-gwyne to chaw up this time . 
If he 'd a-chawed up all the men he 's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he 'd have considerable ruputation now . 
Another one says , I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me , 'cuz then I 'd know I war n't gwyne to die for a thousan ' year . 
Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse , whooping and yelling like an Injun , and singing out : Cler the track , thar . 
I 'm on the waw-path , and the price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise . 
He was drunk , and weaving about in his saddle ; he was over fifty year old , and had a very red face . 
Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him , and he sassed back , and said he 'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns , but he could n't wait now because he 'd come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn , and his motto was , Meat first , and spoon vittles to top off on . 
He see me , and rode up and says : Whar 'd you come f 'm , boy ? 
You prepared to die ? 
Then he rode on . 
I was scared , but a man says : He do n't mean nothing ; he 's always a-carryin ' on like that when he's drunk . 
He 's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw -- never hurt nobody , drunk nor sober . 
Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town , and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells : Come out here , Sherburn ! 
Come out and meet the man you 've swindled . 
You 're the houn ' I 'm after , and I 'm a-gwyne to have you , too ! 
And so he went on , calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to , and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on . 
By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five -- and he was a heap the best dressed man in that town , too -- steps out of the store , and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come . 
He says to Boggs , mighty ca 'm and slow -- he says : I 'm tired of this , but I 'll endure it till one o'clock . 
Till one o'clock , mind -- no longer . 
If you open your mouth against me only once after that time you ca n't travel so far but I will find you . 
Then he turns and goes in . 
The crowd looked mighty sober ; nobody stirred , and there war n't no more laughing . 
Boggs rode off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell , all down the street ; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store , still keeping it up . 
Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up , but he would n't ; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes , and so he _must_ go home -- he must go right away . 
But it didn't do no good . 
He cussed away with all his might , and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it , and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again , with his gray hair a-flying . 
Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober ; but it war n't no use -- up the street he would tear again , and give Sherburn another cussing . 
By and by somebody says : Go for his daughter ! -- quick , go for his daughter ; sometimes he 'll listen to her . 
If anybody can persuade him , she can . 
So somebody started on a run . 
I walked down street a ways and stopped . 
In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again , but not on his horse . 
He was a-reeling across the street towards me , bare-headed , with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along . 
He was quiet , and looked uneasy ; and he war n't hanging back any , but was doing some of the hurrying himself . 
Somebody sings out : Boggs ! 
I looked over there to see who said it , and it was that Colonel Sherburn . 
He was standing perfectly still in the street , and had a pistol raised in his right hand -- not aiming it , but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky . 
The same second I see a young girl coming on the run , and two men with her . 
Boggs and the men turned round to see who called him , and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side , and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level -- both barrels cocked . 
Boggs throws up both of his hands and says , O Lord , do n't shoot ! 
Bang ! 
goes the first shot , and he staggers back , clawing at the air -- bang ! 
goes the second one , and he tumbles backwards on to the ground , heavy and solid , with his arms spread out . 
That young girl screamed out and comes rushing , and down she throws herself on her father , crying , and saying , Oh , he 's killed him , he 's killed him ! 
The crowd closed up around them , and shouldered and jammed one another , with their necks stretched , trying to see , and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting , Back , back ! 
give him air , give him air ! 
Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground , and turned around on his heels and walked off . 
They took Boggs to a little drug store , the crowd pressing around just the same , and the whole town following , and I rushed and got a good place at the window , where I was close to him and could see in . 
They laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head , and opened another one and spread it on his breast ; but they tore open his shirt first , and I seen where one of the bullets went in . 
He made about a dozen long gasps , his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath , and letting it down again when he breathed it out -- and after that he laid still ; he was dead . 
Then they pulled his daughter away from him , screaming and crying , and took her off . 
She was about sixteen , and very sweet and gentle looking , but awful pale and scared . 
Well , pretty soon the whole town was there , squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look , but people that had the places would n't give them up , and folks behind them was saying all the time , Say , now , you 've looked enough , you fellows ; 'tai n't right and 'tai n't fair for you to stay thar all the time , and never give nobody a chance ; other folks has their rights as well as you . 
There was considerable jawing back , so I slid out , thinking maybe there was going to be trouble . 
The streets was full , and everybody was excited . 
Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened , and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows , stretching their necks and listening . 
One long , lanky man , with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head , and a crooked-handled cane , marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood , and the people following him around from one place to t'other and watching everything he done , and bobbing their heads to show they understood , and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane ; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood , frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes , and sung out , Boggs ! 
and then fetched his cane down slow to a level , and says Bang ! 
staggered backwards , says Bang ! 
again , and fell down flat on his back . 
The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect ; said it was just exactly the way it all happened . 
Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him . 
Well , by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched . 
In about a minute everybody was saying it ; so away they went , mad and yelling , and snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with . 
. 
THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn 's house , a-whooping and raging like Injuns , and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush , and it was awful to see . 
Children was heeling it ahead of the mob , screaming and trying to get out of the way ; and every window along the road was full of women 's heads , and there was nigger boys in every tree , and bucks and wenches looking over every fence ; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach . 
Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on , scared most to death . 
They swarmed up in front of Sherburn 's palings as thick as they could jam together , and you could n't hear yourself think for the noise . 
It was a little twenty-foot yard . 
Some sung out Tear down the fence ! 
tear down the fence ! 
Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing , and down she goes , and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave . 
Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch , with a double-barrel gun in his hand , and takes his stand , perfectly ca 'm and deliberate , not saying a word . 
The racket stopped , and the wave sucked back . 
Sherburn never said a word -- just stood there , looking down . 
The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable . 
Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd ; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him , but they could n't ; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky . 
Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed ; not the pleasant kind , but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that 's got sand in it . 
Then he says , slow and scornful : The idea of _you_ lynching anybody ! 
It 's amusing . 
The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_ ! 
Because you 're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here , did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a _man_ ? 
Why , a _man's_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind -- as long as it 's daytime and you 're not behind him . 
Do I know you ? 
I know you clear through . 
I was born and raised in the South , and I 've lived in the North ; so I know the average all around . 
The average man 's a coward . 
In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to , and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it . 
In the South one man all by himself , has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime , and robbed the lot . 
Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people -- whereas you 're just _as_ brave , and no braver . 
Why do n't your juries hang murderers ? 
Because they 're afraid the man 's friends will shoot them in the back , in the dark -- and it 's just what they _would_ do . 
So they always acquit ; and then a _man_ goes in the night , with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal . 
Your mistake is , that you did n't bring a man with you ; that 's one mistake , and the other is that you did n't come in the dark and fetch your masks . 
You brought _part_ of a man -- Buck Harkness , there -- and if you had n't had him to start you , you 'd a taken it out in blowing . 
You did n't want to come . 
The average man do n't like trouble and danger . 
_You_ do n't like trouble and danger . 
But if only _half_ a man -- like Buck Harkness , there -- shouts 'Lynch him ! 
lynch him ! ' 
you're afraid to back down -- afraid you 'll be found out to be what you are -- _cowards_ -- and so you raise a yell , and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man 's coat-tail , and come raging up here , swearing what big things you 're going to do . 
The pitifulest thing out is a mob ; that's what an army is -- a mob ; they do n't fight with courage that 's born in them , but with courage that 's borrowed from their mass , and from their officers . 
But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_ pitifulness . 
Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole . 
If any real lynching 's going to be done it will be done in the dark , Southern fashion ; and when they come they'll bring their masks , and fetch a _man_ along . 
Now _leave_ -- and take your half-a-man with you -- tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this . 
The crowd washed back sudden , and then broke all apart , and went tearing off every which way , and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them , looking tolerable cheap . 
I could a stayed if I wanted to , but I did n't want to . 
I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by , and then dived in under the tent . 
I had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money , but I reckoned I better save it , because there ai n't no telling how soon you are going to need it , away from home and amongst strangers that way . 
You ca n't be too careful . 
I ain't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ai n't no other way , but there ai n't no use in _wasting_ it on them . 
It was a real bully circus . 
It was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in , two and two , a gentleman and lady , side by side , the men just in their drawers and undershirts , and no shoes nor stirrups , and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable -- there must a been twenty of them -- and every lady with a lovely complexion , and perfectly beautiful , and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens , and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars , and just littered with diamonds . 
It was a powerful fine sight ; I never see anything so lovely . 
And then one by one they got up and stood , and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful , the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight , with their heads bobbing and skimming along , away up there under the tent-roof , and every lady 's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips , and she looking like the most loveliest parasol . 
And then faster and faster they went , all of them dancing , first one foot out in the air and then the other , the horses leaning more and more , and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole , cracking his whip and shouting Hi ! -- hi ! 
and the clown cracking jokes behind him ; and by and by all hands dropped the reins , and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms , and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves ! 
And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring , and made the sweetest bow I ever see , and then scampered out , and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild . 
Well , all through the circus they done the most astonishing things ; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people . 
The ringmaster could n't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said ; and how he ever _could_ think of so many of them , and so sudden and so pat , was what I could n't noway understand . 
Why , I could n't a thought of them in a year . 
And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring -- said he wanted to ride ; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was . 
They argued and tried to keep him out , but he would n't listen , and the whole show come to a standstill . 
Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him , and that made him mad , and he begun to rip and tear ; so that stirred up the people , and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring , saying , Knock him down ! 
throw him out ! 
and one or two women begun to scream . 
So , then , the ringmaster he made a little speech , and said he hoped there would n't be no disturbance , and if the man would promise he would n't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse . 
So everybody laughed and said all right , and the man got on . 
The minute he was on , the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around , with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him , and the drunk man hanging on to his neck , and his heels flying in the air every jump , and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down . 
And at last , sure enough , all the circus men could do , the horse broke loose , and away he went like the very nation , round and round the ring , with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck , with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side , and then t'other one on t'other side , and the people just crazy . 
It war n't funny to me , though ; I was all of a tremble to see his danger . 
But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle , a-reeling this way and that ; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood ! 
and the horse a-going like a house afire too . 
He just stood up there , a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he war n't ever drunk in his life -- and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them . 
He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air , and altogether he shed seventeen suits . 
And , then , there he was , slim and handsome , and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw , and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum -- and finally skipped off , and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room , and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment . 
Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled , and he _was_ the sickest ringmaster you ever see , I reckon . 
Why , it was one of his own men ! 
He had got up that joke all out of his own head , and never let on to nobody . 
Well , I felt sheepish enough to be took in so , but I wouldn't a been in that ringmaster 's place , not for a thousand dollars . 
I don't know ; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was , but I never struck them yet . 
Anyways , it was plenty good enough for _me_ ; and wherever I run across it , it can have all of _my_ custom every time . 
Well , that night we had _our_ show ; but there war n't only about twelve people there -- just enough to pay expenses . 
And they laughed all the time , and that made the duke mad ; and everybody left , anyway , before the show was over , but one boy which was asleep . 
So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads could n't come up to Shakespeare ; what they wanted was low comedy -- and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy , he reckoned . 
He said he could size their style . 
So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint , and drawed off some handbills , and stuck them up all over the village . 
The bills said : . 
WELL , all day him and the king was hard at it , rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights ; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time . 
When the place could n't hold no more , the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech , and praised up this tragedy , and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was ; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy , and about Edmund Kean the Elder , which was to play the main principal part in it ; and at last when he 'd got everybody 's expectations up high enough , he rolled up the curtain , and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on all fours , naked ; and he was painted all over , ring-streaked-and-striped , all sorts of colors , as splendid as a rainbow . 
And -- but never mind the rest of his outfit ; it was just wild , but it was awful funny . 
The people most killed themselves laughing ; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes , they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again , and after that they made him do it another time . 
Well , it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut . 
Then the duke he lets the curtain down , and bows to the people , and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more , on accounts of pressing London engagements , where the seats is all sold already for it in Drury Lane ; and then he makes them another bow , and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them , he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it . 
Twenty people sings out : What , is it over ? 
Is that _all_ ? 
The duke says yes . 
Then there was a fine time . 
Everybody sings out , Sold ! 
and rose up mad , and was a-going for that stage and them tragedians . 
But a big , fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts : Hold on ! 
Just a word , gentlemen . 
They stopped to listen . 
We are sold -- mighty badly sold . 
But we do n't want to be the laughing stock of this whole town , I reckon , and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live . 
_No_ . 
What we want is to go out of here quiet , and talk this show up , and sell the _rest_ of the town ! 
Then we 'll all be in the same boat . 
Ai n't that sensible ? 
( You bet it is ! -- the jedge is right ! 
everybody sings out . ) 
All right , then -- not a word about any sell . 
Go along home , and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy . 
Next day you could n't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was . 
House was jammed again that night , and we sold this crowd the same way . 
When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper ; and by and by , about midnight , they made Jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river , and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town . 
The third night the house was crammed again -- and they war n't new-comers this time , but people that was at the show the other two nights . 
I stood by the duke at the door , and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging , or something muffled up under his coat -- and I see it war n't no perfumery , neither , not by a long sight . 
I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel , and rotten cabbages , and such things ; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around , and I bet I do , there was sixty-four of them went in . 
I shoved in there for a minute , but it was too various for me ; I could n't stand it . 
Well , when the place could n't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute , and then he started around for the stage door , I after him ; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says : Walk fast now till you get away from the houses , and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you ! 
I done it , and he done the same . 
We struck the raft at the same time , and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream , all dark and still , and edging towards the middle of the river , nobody saying a word . 
I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience , but nothing of the sort ; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam , and says : Well , how 'd the old thing pan out this time , duke ? 
He had n't been up-town at all . 
We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village . 
Then we lit up and had a supper , and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they 'd served them people . 
The duke says : Greenhorns , flatheads ! 
I knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in ; and I knew they 'd lay for us the third night , and consider it was _their_ turn now . 
Well , it _is_ their turn , and I 'd give something to know how much they 'd take for it . 
I _would_ just like to know how they 're putting in their opportunity . 
They can turn it into a picnic if they want to -- they brought plenty provisions . 
Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights . 
I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before . 
By and by , when they was asleep and snoring , Jim says : Do n't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on , Huck ? 
No , I says , it do n't . 
Why do n't it , Huck ? 
Well , it do n't , because it 's in the breed . 
I reckon they 're all alike . 
But , Huck , dese kings o ' ourn is reglar rapscallions ; dat 's jist what dey is ; dey 's reglar rapscallions . 
Well , that 's what I 'm a-saying ; all kings is mostly rapscallions , as fur as I can make out . 
Is dat so ? 
You read about them once -- you 'll see . 
Look at Henry the Eight ; this ' n 's a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_ . 
And look at Charles Second , and Louis Fourteen , and Louis Fifteen , and James Second , and Edward Second , and Richard Third , and forty more ; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain . 
My , you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom . 
He _was_ a blossom . 
He used to marry a new wife every day , and chop off her head next morning . 
And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs . 
'Fetch up Nell Gwynn , ' he says . 
They fetch her up . 
Next morning , 'Chop off her head ! ' 
And they chop it off . 
'Fetch up Jane Shore , ' he says ; and up she comes , Next morning , 'Chop off her head ' -- and they chop it off . 
'Ring up Fair Rosamun . ' 
Fair Rosamun answers the bell . 
Next morning , 'Chop off her head . ' 
And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night ; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way , and then he put them all in a book , and called it Domesday Book -- which was a good name and stated the case . 
You do n't know kings , Jim , but I know them ; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I 've struck in history . 
Well , Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country . 
How does he go at it -- give notice ? -- give the country a show ? 
No . 
All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard , and whacks out a declaration of independence , and dares them to come on . 
That was _his_ style -- he never give anybody a chance . 
He had suspicions of his father , the Duke of Wellington . 
Well , what did he do ? 
Ask him to show up ? 
No -- drownded him in a butt of mamsey , like a cat . 
S'pose people left money laying around where he was -- what did he do ? 
He collared it . 
S'pose he contracted to do a thing , and you paid him , and did n't set down there and see that he done it -- what did he do ? 
He always done the other thing . 
S'pose he opened his mouth -- what then ? 
If he did n't shut it up powerful quick he 'd lose a lie every time . 
That 's the kind of a bug Henry was ; and if we 'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he 'd a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done . 
I do n't say that ourn is lambs , because they ai n't , when you come right down to the cold facts ; but they ai n't nothing to _that_ old ram , anyway . 
All I say is , kings is kings , and you got to make allowances . 
Take them all around , they 're a mighty ornery lot . 
It 's the way they 're raised . 
But dis one do _smell_ so like de nation , Huck . 
Well , they all do , Jim . 
We ca n't help the way a king smells ; history do n't tell no way . 
Now de duke , he 's a tolerble likely man in some ways . 
Yes , a duke 's different . 
But not very different . 
This one's a middling hard lot for a duke . 
When he 's drunk there ai n't no near-sighted man could tell him from a king . 
Well , anyways , I doan ' hanker for no mo ' un um , Huck . 
Dese is all I kin stan ' . 
It 's the way I feel , too , Jim . 
But we 've got them on our hands , and we got to remember what they are , and make allowances . 
Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that 's out of kings . 
What was the use to tell Jim these war n't real kings and dukes ? 
It would n't a done no good ; and , besides , it was just as I said : you could n't tell them from the real kind . 
I went to sleep , and Jim did n't call me when it was my turn . 
He often done that . 
When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees , moaning and mourning to himself . 
I did n't take notice nor let on . 
I knowed what it was about . 
He was thinking about his wife and his children , away up yonder , and he was low and homesick ; because he had n't ever been away from home before in his life ; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their ' n . 
It do n't seem natural , but I reckon it 's so . 
He was often moaning and mourning that way nights , when he judged I was asleep , and saying , Po ' little 'Lizabeth ! 
po ' little Johnny ! 
it's mighty hard ; I spec ' I ai n't ever gwyne to see you no mo ' , no mo ' ! 
He was a mighty good nigger , Jim was . 
But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones ; and by and by he says : What makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack , er a slam , while ago , en it mine me er de time I treat my little 'Lizabeth so ornery . 
She war n't on ' y 'bout fo ' year ole , en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever , en had a powful rough spell ; but she got well , en one day she was a-stannin ' aroun ' , en I says to her , I says : 'Shet de do ' . ' 
She never done it ; jis ' stood dah , kiner smilin ' up at me . 
It make me mad ; en I says agin , mighty loud , I says : 'Doan ' you hear me ? 
Shet de do ' ! ' 
She jis stood de same way , kiner smilin ' up . 
I was a-bilin ' ! 
I says : ' I lay I _make_ you mine ! ' 
En wid dat I fetch ' her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin ' . 
Den I went into de yuther room , en 'uz gone 'bout ten minutes ; en when I come back dah was dat do ' a-stannin ' open _yit_ , en dat chile stannin' mos ' right in it , a-lookin ' down and mournin ' , en de tears runnin ' down . 
My , but I _wuz_ mad ! 
I was a-gwyne for de chile , but jis ' den -- it was a do ' dat open innerds -- jis ' den , 'long come de wind en slam it to , behine de chile , ker-BLAM ! -- en my lan ' , de chile never move ' ! 
My breff mos' hop outer me ; en I feel so -- so -- I doan ' know HOW I feel . 
I crope out , all a-tremblin ' , en crope aroun ' en open de do ' easy en slow , en poke my head in behine de chile , sof ' en still , en all uv a sudden I says POW ! 
jis ' as loud as I could yell . 
_She never budge ! _ Oh , Huck , I bust out a-cryin ' en grab her up in my arms , en say , 'Oh , de po ' little thing ! 
De Lord God Amighty fogive po ' ole Jim , kaze he never gwyne to fogive hisself as long 's he live ! ' 
Oh , she was plumb deef en dumb , Huck , plumb deef en dumb -- en I 'd ben a-treat ' n her so ! 
. 
NEXT day , towards night , we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle , where there was a village on each side of the river , and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns . 
Jim he spoke to the duke , and said he hoped it would n't take but a few hours , because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope . 
You see , when we left him all alone we had to tie him , because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it would n't look much like he was a runaway nigger , you know . 
So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay roped all day , and he 'd cipher out some way to get around it . 
He was uncommon bright , the duke was , and he soon struck it . 
He dressed Jim up in King Lear 's outfit -- it was a long curtain-calico gown , and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers ; and then he took his theater paint and painted Jim 's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead , dull , solid blue , like a man that 's been drownded nine days . 
Blamed if he war n't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see . 
Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so : Sick Arab -- but harmless when not out of his head . 
And he nailed that shingle to a lath , and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam . 
Jim was satisfied . 
He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day , and trembling all over every time there was a sound . 
The duke told him to make himself free and easy , and if anybody ever come meddling around , he must hop out of the wigwam , and carry on a little , and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast , and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone . 
Which was sound enough judgment ; but you take the average man , and he would n't wait for him to howl . 
Why , he did n't only look like he was dead , he looked considerable more than that . 
These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again , because there was so much money in it , but they judged it would n't be safe , because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time . 
They could n't hit no project that suited exactly ; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he could n't put up something on the Arkansaw village ; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t'other village without any plan , but just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way -- meaning the devil , I reckon . 
We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last ; and now the king put his ' n on , and he told me to put mine on . 
I done it , of course . 
The king's duds was all black , and he did look real swell and starchy . 
I never knowed how clothes could change a body before . 
Why , before , he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was ; but now , when he 'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile , he looked that grand and good and pious that you 'd say he had walked right out of the ark , and maybe was old Leviticus himself . 
Jim cleaned up the canoe , and I got my paddle ready . 
There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point , about three mile above the town -- been there a couple of hours , taking on freight . 
Says the king : Seein ' how I 'm dressed , I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St. Louis or Cincinnati , or some other big place . 
Go for the steamboat , Huckleberry ; we 'll come down to the village on her . 
I did n't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride . 
I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village , and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water . 
Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face , for it was powerful warm weather ; and he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him . 
Run her nose in shore , says the king . 
I done it . 
Wher ' you bound for , young man ? 
For the steamboat ; going to Orleans . 
Git aboard , says the king . 
Hold on a minute , my servant 'll he ' p you with them bags . 
Jump out and he ' p the gentleman , Adolphus -- meaning me , I see . 
I done so , and then we all three started on again . 
The young chap was mighty thankful ; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather . 
He asked the king where he was going , and the king told him he 'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning , and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there . 
The young fellow says : When I first see you I says to myself , 'It 's Mr. Wilks , sure , and he come mighty near getting here in time . ' 
But then I says again , 'No , I reckon it ai n't him , or else he would n't be paddling up the river . ' 
You _ain't_ him , are you ? 
No , my name 's Blodgett -- Elexander Blodgett -- _Reverend_ Elexander Blodgett , I s'pose I must say , as I 'm one o ' the Lord 's poor servants . 
But still I 'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time , all the same , if he 's missed anything by it -- which I hope he has n't . 
Well , he do n't miss any property by it , because he 'll get that all right ; but he 's missed seeing his brother Peter die -- which he mayn't mind , nobody can tell as to that -- but his brother would a give anything in this world to see _him_ before he died ; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks ; had n't seen him since they was boys together -- and had n't ever seen his brother William at all -- that 's the deef and dumb one -- William ai n't more than thirty or thirty-five . 
Peter and George were the only ones that come out here ; George was the married brother ; him and his wife both died last year . 
Harvey and William 's the only ones that 's left now ; and , as I was saying , they have n't got here in time . 
Did anybody send 'em word ? 
Oh , yes ; a month or two ago , when Peter was first took ; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he war n't going to get well this time . 
You see , he was pretty old , and George 's g'yirls was too young to be much company for him , except Mary Jane , the red-headed one ; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died , and did n't seem to care much to live . 
He most desperately wanted to see Harvey -- and William , too , for that matter -- because he was one of them kind that can't bear to make a will . 
He left a letter behind for Harvey , and said he'd told in it where his money was hid , and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George 's g'yirls would be all right -- for George did n't leave nothing . 
And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to . 
Why do you reckon Harvey do n't come ? 
Wher ' does he live ? 
Oh , he lives in England -- Sheffield -- preaches there -- has n't ever been in this country . 
He has n't had any too much time -- and besides he might n't a got the letter at all , you know . 
Too bad , too bad he could n't a lived to see his brothers , poor soul . 
You going to Orleans , you say ? 
Yes , but that ai n't only a part of it . 
I 'm going in a ship , next Wednesday , for Ryo Janeero , where my uncle lives . 
It 's a pretty long journey . 
But it 'll be lovely ; wisht I was a-going . 
Is Mary Jane the oldest ? 
How old is the others ? 
Mary Jane 's nineteen , Susan 's fifteen , and Joanna 's about fourteen -- that 's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip . 
Poor things ! 
to be left alone in the cold world so . 
Well , they could be worse off . 
Old Peter had friends , and they ai n't going to let them come to no harm . 
There 's Hobson , the Babtis' preacher ; and Deacon Lot Hovey , and Ben Rucker , and Abner Shackleford , and Levi Bell , the lawyer ; and Dr. Robinson , and their wives , and the widow Bartley , and -- well , there 's a lot of them ; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with , and used to write about sometimes , when he wrote home ; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets here . 
Well , the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow . 
Blamed if he did n't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town , and all about the Wilkses ; and about Peter 's business -- which was a tanner ; and about George 's -- which was a carpenter ; and about Harvey 's -- which was a dissentering minister ; and so on , and so on . 
Then he says : What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for ? 
Because she 's a big Orleans boat , and I was afeard she might n't stop there . 
When they 're deep they wo n't stop for a hail . 
A Cincinnati boat will , but this is a St. Louis one . 
Was Peter Wilks well off ? 
Oh , yes , pretty well off . 
He had houses and land , and it 's reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers . 
When did you say he died ? 
I did n't say , but it was last night . 
Funeral to-morrow , likely ? 
Yes , 'bout the middle of the day . 
Well , it 's all terrible sad ; but we 've all got to go , one time or another . 
So what we want to do is to be prepared ; then we 're all right . 
Yes , sir , it 's the best way . 
Ma used to always say that . 
When we struck the boat she was about done loading , and pretty soon she got off . 
The king never said nothing about going aboard , so I lost my ride , after all . 
When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place , and then he got ashore and says : Now hustle back , right off , and fetch the duke up here , and the new carpet-bags . 
And if he 's gone over to t'other side , go over there and git him . 
And tell him to git himself up regardless . 
Shove along , now . 
I see what _he_ was up to ; but I never said nothing , of course . 
When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe , and then they set down on a log , and the king told him everything , just like the young fellow had said it -- every last word of it . 
And all the time he was a-doing it he tried to talk like an Englishman ; and he done it pretty well , too , for a slouch . 
I ca n't imitate him , and so I ai n't a-going to try to ; but he really done it pretty good . 
Then he says : How are you on the deef and dumb , Bilgewater ? 
The duke said , leave him alone for that ; said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards . 
So then they waited for a steamboat . 
About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along , but they did n't come from high enough up the river ; but at last there was a big one , and they hailed her . 
She sent out her yawl , and we went aboard , and she was from Cincinnati ; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad , and gave us a cussing , and said they would n't land us . 
But the king was ca 'm . 
He says : If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl , a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em , ca n't it ? 
So they softened down and said it was all right ; and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore . 
About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming , and when the king says : Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher ' Mr. Peter Wilks lives ? 
they give a glance at one another , and nodded their heads , as much as to say , What d ' I tell you ? 
Then one of them says , kind of soft and gentle : I 'm sorry sir , but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_ live yesterday evening . 
Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash , and fell up against the man , and put his chin on his shoulder , and cried down his back , and says : Alas , alas , our poor brother -- gone , and we never got to see him ; oh , it 's too , too hard ! 
Then he turns around , blubbering , and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands , and blamed if he did n't drop a carpet-bag and bust out a-crying . 
If they war n't the beatenest lot , them two frauds , that ever I struck . 
Well , the men gathered around and sympathized with them , and said all sorts of kind things to them , and carried their carpet-bags up the hill for them , and let them lean on them and cry , and told the king all about his brother 's last moments , and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke , and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they 'd lost the twelve disciples . 
Well , if ever I struck anything like it , I 'm a nigger . 
It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race . 
. 
THE news was all over town in two minutes , and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way , some of them putting on their coats as they come . 
Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd , and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march . 
The windows and dooryards was full ; and every minute somebody would say , over a fence : Is it _them_ ? 
And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say : You bet it is . 
When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed , and the three girls was standing in the door . 
Mary Jane _was_ red-headed , but that do n't make no difference , she was most awful beautiful , and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory , she was so glad her uncles was come . 
The king he spread his arms , and Mary Jane she jumped for them , and the hare-lip jumped for the duke , and there they had it ! 
Everybody most , leastways women , cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times . 
Then the king he hunched the duke private -- I see him do it -- and then he looked around and see the coffin , over in the corner on two chairs ; so then him and the duke , with a hand across each other 's shoulder , and t'other hand to their eyes , walked slow and solemn over there , everybody dropping back to give them room , and all the talk and noise stopping , people saying Sh ! 
and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads , so you could a heard a pin fall . 
And when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin , and took one sight , and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans , most ; and then they put their arms around each other 's necks , and hung their chins over each other 's shoulders ; and then for three minutes , or maybe four , I never see two men leak the way they done . 
And , mind you , everybody was doing the same ; and the place was that damp I never see anything like it . 
Then one of them got on one side of the coffin , and t'other on t'other side , and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin , and let on to pray all to themselves . 
Well , when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it , and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud -- the poor girls , too ; and every woman , nearly , went up to the girls , without saying a word , and kissed them , solemn , on the forehead , and then put their hand on their head , and looked up towards the sky , with the tears running down , and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing , and give the next woman a show . 
I never see anything so disgusting . 
Well , by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little , and works himself up and slobbers out a speech , all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased , and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile , but it 's a trial that 's sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears , and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother 's heart , because out of their mouths they ca n't , words being too weak and cold , and all that kind of rot and slush , till it was just sickening ; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen , and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust . 
And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer , and everybody joined in with all their might , and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out . 
Music is a good thing ; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never see it freshen up things so , and sound so honest and bully . 
Then the king begins to work his jaw again , and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening , and help set up with the ashes of the diseased ; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name , for they was names that was very dear to him , and mentioned often in his letters ; and so he will name the same , to wit , as follows , vizz . : -- Rev . 
Mr. Hobson , and Deacon Lot Hovey , and Mr. Ben Rucker , and Abner Shackleford , and Levi Bell , and Dr. Robinson , and their wives , and the widow Bartley . 
Rev . 
Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting together -- that is , I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other world , and the preacher was pinting him right . 
Lawyer Bell was away up to Louisville on business . 
But the rest was on hand , and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him ; and then they shook hands with the duke and did n't say nothing , but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said Goo-goo -- goo-goo-goo all the time , like a baby that ca n't talk . 
So the king he blattered along , and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town , by his name , and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town , or to George 's family , or to Peter . 
And he always let on that Peter wrote him the things ; but that was a lie : he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat . 
Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind , and the king he read it out loud and cried over it . 
It give the dwelling-house and three thousand dollars , gold , to the girls ; and it give the tanyard ( which was doing a good business ) , along with some other houses and land ( worth about seven thousand ) , and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William , and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar . 
So these two frauds said they 'd go and fetch it up , and have everything square and above-board ; and told me to come with a candle . 
We shut the cellar door behind us , and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor , and it was a lovely sight , all them yaller-boys . 
My , the way the king 's eyes did shine ! 
He slaps the duke on the shoulder and says : Oh , _this_ ai n't bully nor noth ' n ! 
Oh , no , I reckon not ! 
Why , _bully_ , it beats the Nonesuch , _don't_ it ? 
The duke allowed it did . 
They pawed the yaller-boys , and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor ; and the king says : It ai n't no use talkin ' ; bein ' brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that 's got left is the line for you and me , Bilge . 
Thish yer comes of trust ' n to Providence . 
It 's the best way , in the long run . 
I 've tried 'em all , and ther ' ai n't no better way . 
Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile , and took it on trust ; but no , they must count it . 
So they counts it , and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short . 
Says the king : Dern him , I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars ? 
They worried over that awhile , and ransacked all around for it . 
Then the duke says : Well , he was a pretty sick man , and likely he made a mistake -- I reckon that 's the way of it . 
The best way 's to let it go , and keep still about it . 
We can spare it . 
Oh , shucks , yes , we can _spare_ it . 
I do n't k'yer noth ' n 'bout that -- it 's the _count_ I 'm thinkin ' about . 
We want to be awful square and open and above-board here , you know . 
We want to lug this h-yer money up stairs and count it before everybody -- then ther ' ai n't noth ' n suspicious . 
But when the dead man says ther 's six thous ' n dollars , you know , we do n't want to -- Hold on , says the duke . 
Le 's make up the deffisit , and he begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket . 
It 's a most amaz ' n ' good idea , duke -- you _have_ got a rattlin ' clever head on you , says the king . 
Blest if the old Nonesuch ai n't a heppin' us out agin , and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up . 
It most busted them , but they made up the six thousand clean and clear . 
Say , says the duke , I got another idea . 
Le 's go up stairs and count this money , and then take and _give it to the girls_ . 
Good land , duke , lem me hug you ! 
It 's the most dazzling idea 'at ever a man struck . 
You have cert'nly got the most astonishin ' head I ever see . 
Oh , this is the boss dodge , ther ' ai n't no mistake 'bout it . 
Let 'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to -- this 'll lay 'em out . 
When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table , and the king he counted it and stacked it up , three hundred dollars in a pile -- twenty elegant little piles . 
Everybody looked hungry at it , and licked their chops . 
Then they raked it into the bag again , and I see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech . 
He says : Friends all , my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that 's left behind in the vale of sorrers . 
He has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered , and that 's left fatherless and motherless . 
Yes , and we that knowed him knows that he would a done _more_ generous by 'em if he had n't ben afeard o ' woundin' his dear William and me . 
Now , _wouldn't_ he ? 
Ther ' ai n't no question 'bout it in _my_ mind . 
Well , then , what kind o ' brothers would it be that 'd stand in his way at sech a time ? 
And what kind o ' uncles would it be that 'd rob -- yes , _rob_ -- sech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved so at sech a time ? 
If I know William -- and I _think_ I do -- he -- well , I'll jest ask him . 
He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands , and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather-headed a while ; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning , and jumps for the king , goo-gooing with all his might for joy , and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up . 
Then the king says , I knowed it ; I reckon _that 'll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels about it . 
Here , Mary Jane , Susan , Joanner , take the money -- take it _all_ . 
It 's the gift of him that lays yonder , cold but joyful . 
Mary Jane she went for him , Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke , and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet . 
And everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes , and most shook the hands off of them frauds , saying all the time : You _dear_ good souls ! -- how _lovely_ ! -- how _could_ you ! 
Well , then , pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again , and how good he was , and what a loss he was , and all that ; and before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside , and stood a-listening and looking , and not saying anything ; and nobody saying anything to him either , because the king was talking and they was all busy listening . 
The king was saying -- in the middle of something he'd started in on -- -- they bein ' partickler friends o ' the diseased . 
That 's why they're invited here this evenin ' ; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come -- everybody ; for he respected everybody , he liked everybody , and so it 's fitten that his funeral orgies sh 'd be public . 
And so he went a-mooning on and on , liking to hear himself talk , and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again , till the duke he could n't stand it no more ; so he writes on a little scrap of paper , _Obsequies_ , you old fool , and folds it up , and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people 's heads to him . 
The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket , and says : Poor William , afflicted as he is , his _heart's_ aluz right . 
Asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral -- wants me to make 'em all welcome . 
But he need n't a worried -- it was jest what I was at . 
Then he weaves along again , perfectly ca 'm , and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then , just like he done before . 
And when he done it the third time he says : I say orgies , not because it 's the common term , because it ai n't -- obsequies bein ' the common term -- but because orgies is the right term . 
Obsequies ai n't used in England no more now -- it 's gone out . 
We say orgies now in England . 
Orgies is better , because it means the thing you 're after more exact . 
It 's a word that 's made up out ' n the Greek _orgo_ , outside , open , abroad ; and the Hebrew _jeesum_ , to plant , cover up ; hence in_ter._ So , you see , funeral orgies is an open er public funeral . 
He was the _worst_ I ever struck . 
Well , the iron-jawed man he laughed right in his face . 
Everybody was shocked . 
Everybody says , Why , _doctor_ ! 
and Abner Shackleford says : Why , Robinson , hai n't you heard the news ? 
This is Harvey Wilks . 
The king he smiled eager , and shoved out his flapper , and says : Is it my poor brother 's dear good friend and physician ? 
I -- Keep your hands off of me ! 
says the doctor . 
_You_ talk like an Englishman , _don't_ you ? 
It 's the worst imitation I ever heard . 
_You_ Peter Wilks 's brother ! 
You 're a fraud , that 's what you are ! 
Well , how they all took on ! 
They crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down , and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey 'd showed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey , and knowed everybody by name , and the names of the very dogs , and begged and _begged_ him not to hurt Harvey 's feelings and the poor girl 's feelings , and all that . 
But it war n't no use ; he stormed right along , and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and could n't imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar . 
The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying ; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_ . 
He says : I was your father 's friend , and I 'm your friend ; and I warn you as a friend , and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble , to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him , the ignorant tramp , with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew , as he calls it . 
He is the thinnest kind of an impostor -- has come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres , and you take them for _proofs_ , and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here , who ought to know better . 
Mary Jane Wilks , you know me for your friend , and for your unselfish friend , too . 
Now listen to me ; turn this pitiful rascal out -- I _beg_ you to do it . 
Will you ? 
Mary Jane straightened herself up , and my , but she was handsome ! 
She says : _Here_ is my answer . 
She hove up the bag of money and put it in the king 's hands , and says , Take this six thousand dollars , and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to , and do n't give us no receipt for it . 
Then she put her arm around the king on one side , and Susan and the hare-lip done the same on the other . 
Everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm , whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud . 
The doctor says : All right ; I wash _my_ hands of the matter . 
But I warn you all that a time 's coming when you 're going to feel sick whenever you think of this day . 
And away he went . 
All right , doctor , says the king , kinder mocking him ; we 'll try and get 'em to send for you ; which made them all laugh , and they said it was a prime good hit . 
. 
WELL , when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off for spare rooms , and she said she had one spare room , which would do for Uncle William , and she 'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey , which was a little bigger , and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot ; and up garret was a little cubby , with a pallet in it . 
The king said the cubby would do for his valley -- meaning me . 
So Mary Jane took us up , and she showed them their rooms , which was plain but nice . 
She said she 'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey 's way , but he said they war n't . 
The frocks was hung along the wall , and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor . 
There was an old hair trunk in one corner , and a guitar-box in another , and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around , like girls brisken up a room with . 
The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings , and so do n't disturb them . 
The duke 's room was pretty small , but plenty good enough , and so was my cubby . 
That night they had a big supper , and all them men and women was there , and I stood behind the king and the duke 's chairs and waited on them , and the niggers waited on the rest . 
Mary Jane she set at the head of the table , with Susan alongside of her , and said how bad the biscuits was , and how mean the preserves was , and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was -- and all that kind of rot , the way women always do for to force out compliments ; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop , and said so -- said How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice ? 
and Where , for the land 's sake , _did_ you get these amaz ' n pickles ? 
and all that kind of humbug talky-talk , just the way people always does at a supper , you know . 
And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings , whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things . 
The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England , and blest if I did n't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes . 
She says : Did you ever see the king ? 
Who ? 
William Fourth ? 
Well , I bet I have -- he goes to our church . 
I knowed he was dead years ago , but I never let on . 
So when I says he goes to our church , she says : What -- regular ? 
Yes -- regular . 
His pew 's right over opposite ourn -- on t'other side the pulpit . 
I thought he lived in London ? 
Well , he does . 
Where _would_ he live ? 
But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield ? 
I see I was up a stump . 
I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone , so as to get time to think how to get down again . 
Then I says : I mean he goes to our church regular when he 's in Sheffield . 
That's only in the summer time , when he comes there to take the sea baths . 
Why , how you talk -- Sheffield ai n't on the sea . 
Well , who said it was ? 
Why , you did . 
I _didn't_ nuther . 
You did ! 
I did n't . 
You did . 
I never said nothing of the kind . 
Well , what _did_ you say , then ? 
Said he come to take the sea _baths_ -- that 's what I said . 
Well , then , how 's he going to take the sea baths if it ai n't on the sea ? 
Looky here , I says ; did you ever see any Congress-water ? 
Yes . 
Well , did you have to go to Congress to get it ? 
Why , no . 
Well , neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath . 
How does he get it , then ? 
Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water -- in barrels . 
There in the palace at Sheffield they 've got furnaces , and he wants his water hot . 
They ca n't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea . 
They have n't got no conveniences for it . 
Oh , I see , now . 
You might a said that in the first place and saved time . 
When she said that I see I was out of the woods again , and so I was comfortable and glad . 
Next , she says : Do you go to church , too ? 
Yes -- regular . 
Where do you set ? 
Why , in our pew . 
_Whose_ pew ? 
Why , _ourn_ -- your Uncle Harvey 's . 
His ' n ? 
What does _he_ want with a pew ? 
Wants it to set in . 
What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it ? 
Why , I thought he 'd be in the pulpit . 
Rot him , I forgot he was a preacher . 
I see I was up a stump again , so I played another chicken bone and got another think . 
Then I says : Blame it , do you suppose there ai n't but one preacher to a church ? 
Why , what do they want with more ? 
What ! -- to preach before a king ? 
I never did see such a girl as you . 
They do n't have no less than seventeen . 
Seventeen ! 
My land ! 
Why , I would n't set out such a string as that , not if I _never_ got to glory . 
It must take 'em a week . 
Shucks , they do n't _all_ of 'em preach the same day -- only _one_ of 'em . 
Well , then , what does the rest of 'em do ? 
Oh , nothing much . 
Loll around , pass the plate -- and one thing or another . 
But mainly they do n't do nothing . 
Well , then , what are they _for_ ? 
Why , they 're for _style_ . 
Do n't you know nothing ? 
Well , I do n't _want_ to know no such foolishness as that . 
How is servants treated in England ? 
Do they treat 'em better ' n we treat our niggers ? 
_No_ ! 
A servant ai n't nobody there . 
They treat them worse than dogs . 
Do n't they give 'em holidays , the way we do , Christmas and New Year's week , and Fourth of July ? 
Oh , just listen ! 
A body could tell _you_ hai n't ever been to England by that . 
Why , Hare-l -- why , Joanna , they never see a holiday from year's end to year 's end ; never go to the circus , nor theater , nor nigger shows , nor nowheres . 
Nor church ? 
Nor church . 
But _you_ always went to church . 
Well , I was gone up again . 
I forgot I was the old man 's servant . 
But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he wanted to or not , and set with the family , on account of its being the law . 
But I did n't do it pretty good , and when I got done I see she war n't satisfied . 
She says : Honest injun , now , hai n't you been telling me a lot of lies ? 
Honest injun , says I . 
None of it at all ? 
None of it at all . 
Not a lie in it , says I . 
Lay your hand on this book and say it . 
I see it war n't nothing but a dictionary , so I laid my hand on it and said it . 
So then she looked a little better satisfied , and says : Well , then , I 'll believe some of it ; but I hope to gracious if I'll believe the rest . 
What is it you wo n't believe , Joe ? 
says Mary Jane , stepping in with Susan behind her . 
It ai n't right nor kind for you to talk so to him , and him a stranger and so far from his people . 
How would you like to be treated so ? 
That 's always your way , Maim -- always sailing in to help somebody before they 're hurt . 
I hai n't done nothing to him . 
He 's told some stretchers , I reckon , and I said I would n't swallow it all ; and that 's every bit and grain I _did_ say . 
I reckon he can stand a little thing like that , ca n't he ? 
I do n't care whether 't was little or whether 't was big ; he 's here in our house and a stranger , and it was n't good of you to say it . 
If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed ; and so you ought n't to say a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed . 
Why , Mam , he said -- It do n't make no difference what he _said_ -- that ai n't the thing . 
The thing is for you to treat him _kind_ , and not be saying things to make him remember he ai n't in his own country and amongst his own folks . 
I says to myself , _this_ is a girl that I 'm letting that old reptile rob her of her money ! 
Then Susan _she_ waltzed in ; and if you 'll believe me , she did give Hare-lip hark from the tomb ! 
Says I to myself , and this is _another_ one that I 'm letting him rob her of her money ! 
Then Mary Jane she took another inning , and went in sweet and lovely again -- which was her way ; but when she got done there war n't hardly anything left o ' poor Hare-lip . 
So she hollered . 
All right , then , says the other girls ; you just ask his pardon . 
She done it , too ; and she done it beautiful . 
She done it so beautiful it was good to hear ; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies , so she could do it again . 
I says to myself , this is _another_ one that I 'm letting him rob her of her money . 
And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends . 
I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself , my mind 's made up ; I 'll hive that money for them or bust . 
So then I lit out -- for bed , I said , meaning some time or another . 
When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over . 
I says to myself , shall I go to that doctor , private , and blow on these frauds ? 
No -- that wo n't do . 
He might tell who told him ; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me . 
Shall I go , private , and tell Mary Jane ? 
No -- I das n't do it . 
Her face would give them a hint , sure ; they 've got the money , and they 'd slide right out and get away with it . 
If she was to fetch in help I 'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with , I judge . 
No ; there ai n't no good way but one . 
I got to steal that money , somehow ; and I got to steal it some way that they wo n't suspicion that I done it . 
They 've got a good thing here , and they ai n't a-going to leave till they 've played this family and this town for all they're worth , so I 'll find a chance time enough . 
I 'll steal it and hide it ; and by and by , when I 'm away down the river , I 'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it 's hid . 
But I better hive it tonight if I can , because the doctor maybe has n't let up as much as he lets on he has ; he might scare them out of here yet . 
So , thinks I , I 'll go and search them rooms . 
Upstairs the hall was dark , but I found the duke 's room , and started to paw around it with my hands ; but I recollected it would n't be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self ; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there . 
But I see I could n't do nothing without a candle , and I das n't light one , of course . 
So I judged I'd got to do the other thing -- lay for them and eavesdrop . 
About that time I hears their footsteps coming , and was going to skip under the bed ; I reached for it , but it was n't where I thought it would be ; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane 's frocks , so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns , and stood there perfectly still . 
They come in and shut the door ; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed . 
Then I was glad I had n't found the bed when I wanted it . 
And yet , you know , it 's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private . 
They sets down then , and the king says : Well , what is it ? 
And cut it middlin ' short , because it 's better for us to be down there a-whoopin ' up the mournin ' than up here givin ' 'em a chance to talk us over . 
Well , this is it , Capet . 
I ai n't easy ; I ai n't comfortable . 
That doctor lays on my mind . 
I wanted to know your plans . 
I 've got a notion , and I think it 's a sound one . 
What is it , duke ? 
That we better glide out of this before three in the morning , and clip it down the river with what we 've got . 
Specially , seeing we got it so easy -- _given_ back to us , flung at our heads , as you may say , when of course we allowed to have to steal it back . 
I 'm for knocking off and lighting out . 
That made me feel pretty bad . 
About an hour or two ago it would a been a little different , but now it made me feel bad and disappointed , The king rips out and says : What ! 
And not sell out the rest o ' the property ? 
March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous ' n ' dollars ' worth o' property layin ' around jest sufferin ' to be scooped in ? -- and all good , salable stuff , too . 
The duke he grumbled ; said the bag of gold was enough , and he didn't want to go no deeper -- did n't want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_ they had . 
Why , how you talk ! 
says the king . 
We sha ' n't rob 'em of nothing at all but jest this money . 
The people that _buys_ the property is the suff'rers ; because as soon 's it 's found out 'at we did n't own it -- which wo n't be long after we 've slid -- the sale wo n't be valid , and it 'll all go back to the estate . 
These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin , and that 's enough for _them_ ; they 're young and spry , and k ' n easy earn a livin ' . 
_they_ ai n't a-goin to suffer . 
Why , jest think -- there's thous ' n 's and thous ' n 's that ai n't nigh so well off . 
Bless you , _they_ ai n't got noth ' n ' to complain of . 
Well , the king he talked him blind ; so at last he give in , and said all right , but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay , and that doctor hanging over them . 
But the king says : Cuss the doctor ! 
What do we k'yer for _him_ ? 
Hai n't we got all the fools in town on our side ? 
And ai n't that a big enough majority in any town ? 
So they got ready to go down stairs again . 
The duke says : I do n't think we put that money in a good place . 
That cheered me up . 
I 'd begun to think I war n't going to get a hint of no kind to help me . 
The king says : Why ? 
Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out ; and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put 'em away ; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it ? 
Your head 's level agin , duke , says the king ; and he comes a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was . 
I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still , though quivery ; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me ; and I tried to think what I 'd better do if they did catch me . 
But the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought , and he never suspicioned I was around . 
They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed , and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now , because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed , and do n't turn over the straw tick only about twice a year , and so it war n't in no danger of getting stole now . 
But I knowed better . 
I had it out of there before they was half-way down stairs . 
I groped along up to my cubby , and hid it there till I could get a chance to do better . 
I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres , because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking : I knowed that very well . 
Then I turned in , with my clothes all on ; but I could n't a gone to sleep if I 'd a wanted to , I was in such a sweat to get through with the business . 
By and by I heard the king and the duke come up ; so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder , and waited to see if anything was going to happen . 
But nothing did . 
So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't begun yet ; and then I slipped down the ladder . 
. 
I crept to their doors and listened ; they was snoring . 
So I tiptoed along , and got down stairs all right . 
There war n't a sound anywheres . 
I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door , and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs . 
The door was open into the parlor , where the corpse was laying , and there was a candle in both rooms . 
I passed along , and the parlor door was open ; but I see there war n't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter ; so I shoved on by ; but the front door was locked , and the key was n't there . 
Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs , back behind me . 
I run in the parlor and took a swift look around , and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin . 
The lid was shoved along about a foot , showing the dead man 's face down in there , with a wet cloth over it , and his shroud on . 
I tucked the money-bag in under the lid , just down beyond where his hands was crossed , which made me creep , they was so cold , and then I run back across the room and in behind the door . 
The person coming was Mary Jane . 
She went to the coffin , very soft , and kneeled down and looked in ; then she put up her handkerchief , and I see she begun to cry , though I could n't hear her , and her back was to me . 
I slid out , and as I passed the dining-room I thought I 'd make sure them watchers had n't seen me ; so I looked through the crack , and everything was all right . 
They had n't stirred . 
I slipped up to bed , feeling ruther blue , on accounts of the thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it . 
Says I , if it could stay where it is , all right ; because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane , and she could dig him up again and get it ; but that ai n't the thing that 's going to happen ; the thing that 's going to happen is , the money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid . 
Then the king 'll get it again , and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him . 
Of course I _wanted_ to slide down and get it out of there , but I das n't try it . 
Every minute it was getting earlier now , and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir , and I might get catched -- catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody had n't hired me to take care of . 
I do n't wish to be mixed up in no such business as that , I says to myself . 
When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up , and the watchers was gone . 
There war n't nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe . 
I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening , but I could n't tell . 
Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man , and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs , and then set all our chairs in rows , and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full . 
I see the coffin lid was the way it was before , but I das n't go to look in under it , with folks around . 
Then the people begun to flock in , and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin , and for a half an hour the people filed around slow , in single rank , and looked down at the dead man 's face a minute , and some dropped in a tear , and it was all very still and solemn , only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent , and sobbing a little . 
There war n't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses -- because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church . 
When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways , putting on the last touches , and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable , and making no more sound than a cat . 
He never spoke ; he moved people around , he squeezed in late ones , he opened up passageways , and done it with nods , and signs with his hands . 
Then he took his place over against the wall . 
He was the softest , glidingest , stealthiest man I ever see ; and there war n't no more smile to him than there is to a ham . 
They had borrowed a melodeum -- a sick one ; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it , and it was pretty skreeky and colicky , and everybody joined in and sung , and Peter was the only one that had a good thing , according to my notion . 
Then the Reverend Hobson opened up , slow and solemn , and begun to talk ; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard ; it was only one dog , but he made a most powerful racket , and he kept it up right along ; the parson he had to stand there , over the coffin , and wait -- you could n't hear yourself think . 
It was right down awkward , and nobody did n't seem to know what to do . 
But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say , Do n't you worry -- just depend on me . 
Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall , just his shoulders showing over the people's heads . 
So he glided along , and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time ; and at last , when he had gone around two sides of the room , he disappears down cellar . 
Then in about two seconds we heard a whack , and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two , and then everything was dead still , and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off . 
In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall again ; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room , and then rose up , and shaded his mouth with his hands , and stretched his neck out towards the preacher , over the people 's heads , and says , in a kind of a coarse whisper , _He had a rat_ ! 
Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place . 
You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people , because naturally they wanted to know . 
A little thing like that don't cost nothing , and it 's just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked . 
There war n't no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was . 
Well , the funeral sermon was very good , but pison long and tiresome ; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage , and at last the job was through , and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw-driver . 
I was in a sweat then , and watched him pretty keen . 
But he never meddled at all ; just slid the lid along as soft as mush , and screwed it down tight and fast . 
So there I was ! 
I did n't know whether the money was in there or not . 
So , says I , s'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly ? -- now how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not ? 
S'pose she dug him up and did n't find nothing , what would she think of me ? 
Blame it , I says , I might get hunted up and jailed ; I 'd better lay low and keep dark , and not write at all ; the thing 's awful mixed now ; trying to better it , I 've worsened it a hundred times , and I wish to goodness I 'd just let it alone , dad fetch the whole business ! 
They buried him , and we come back home , and I went to watching faces again -- I could n't help it , and I could n't rest easy . 
But nothing come of it ; the faces did n't tell me nothing . 
The king he visited around in the evening , and sweetened everybody up , and made himself ever so friendly ; and he give out the idea that his congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him , so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home . 
He was very sorry he was so pushed , and so was everybody ; they wished he could stay longer , but they said they could see it could n't be done . 
And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them ; and that pleased everybody too , because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations ; and it pleased the girls , too -- tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world ; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to , they would be ready . 
Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so , but I did n't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune . 
Well , blamed if the king did n't bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight off -- sale two days after the funeral ; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to . 
So the next day after the funeral , along about noon-time , the girls ' joy got the first jolt . 
A couple of nigger traders come along , and the king sold them the niggers reasonable , for three-day drafts as they called it , and away they went , the two sons up the river to Memphis , and their mother down the river to Orleans . 
I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief ; they cried around each other , and took on so it most made me down sick to see it . 
The girls said they had n't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town . 
I ca n't ever get it out of my memory , the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other 's necks and crying ; and I reckon I could n't a stood it all , but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I had n't knowed the sale war n't no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two . 
The thing made a big stir in the town , too , and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way . 
It injured the frauds some ; but the old fool he bulled right along , spite of all the duke could say or do , and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy . 
Next day was auction day . 
About broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up , and I see by their look that there was trouble . 
The king says : Was you in my room night before last ? 
No , your majesty -- which was the way I always called him when nobody but our gang war n't around . 
Was you in there yisterday er last night ? 
No , your majesty . 
Honor bright , now -- no lies . 
Honor bright , your majesty , I 'm telling you the truth . 
I hai n't been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to you . 
The duke says : Have you seen anybody else go in there ? 
No , your grace , not as I remember , I believe . 
Stop and think . 
I studied awhile and see my chance ; then I says : Well , I see the niggers go in there several times . 
Both of them gave a little jump , and looked like they had n't ever expected it , and then like they _had_ . 
Then the duke says : What , all of them ? 
No -- leastways , not all at once -- that is , I do n't think I ever see them all come _out_ at once but just one time . 
Hello ! 
When was that ? 
It was the day we had the funeral . 
In the morning . 
It war n't early , because I overslept . 
I was just starting down the ladder , and I see them . 
Well , go on , _go_ on ! 
What did they do ? 
How 'd they act ? 
They did n't do nothing . 
And they did n't act anyway much , as fur as I see . 
They tiptoed away ; so I seen , easy enough , that they 'd shoved in there to do up your majesty 's room , or something , s'posing you was up ; and found you _warn't_ up , and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up , if they had n't already waked you up . 
Great guns , _this_ is a go ! 
says the king ; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly . 
They stood there a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute , and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle , and says : It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand . 
They let on to be _sorry_ they was going out of this region ! 
And I believed they _was_ sorry , and so did you , and so did everybody . 
Do n't ever tell _me_ any more that a nigger ai n't got any histrionic talent . 
Why , the way they played that thing it would fool _anybody_ . 
In my opinion , there's a fortune in 'em . 
If I had capital and a theater , I would n't want a better lay-out than that -- and here we 've gone and sold 'em for a song . 
Yes , and ai n't privileged to sing the song yet . 
Say , where _is_ that song -- that draft ? 
In the bank for to be collected . 
Where _would_ it be ? 
Well , _that's_ all right then , thank goodness . 
Says I , kind of timid-like : Is something gone wrong ? 
The king whirls on me and rips out : None o ' your business ! 
You keep your head shet , and mind y ' r own affairs -- if you got any . 
Long as you 're in this town do n't you forgit _that_ -- you hear ? 
Then he says to the duke , We got to jest swaller it and say noth ' n ' : mum 's the word for _us_ . 
As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again , and says : Quick sales _and_ small profits ! 
It 's a good business -- yes . 
The king snarls around on him and says : I was trying to do for the best in sellin ' 'em out so quick . 
If the profits has turned out to be none , lackin ' considable , and none to carry , is it my fault any more ' n it 's yourn ? 
Well , _they'd_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn't_ if I could a got my advice listened to . 
The king sassed back as much as was safe for him , and then swapped around and lit into _me_ again . 
He give me down the banks for not coming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way -- said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up . 
And then waltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile , and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning , and he 'd be blamed if he 'd ever do it again . 
So they went off a-jawing ; and I felt dreadful glad I 'd worked it all off on to the niggers , and yet hadn't done the niggers no harm by it . 
. 
BY and by it was getting-up time . 
So I come down the ladder and started for down-stairs ; but as I come to the girls ' room the door was open , and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk , which was open and she'd been packing things in it -- getting ready to go to England . 
But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap , and had her face in her hands , crying . 
I felt awful bad to see it ; of course anybody would . 
I went in there and says : Miss Mary Jane , you ca n't a-bear to see people in trouble , and I ca n't -- most always . 
Tell me about it . 
So she done it . 
And it was the niggers -- I just expected it . 
She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her ; she didn't know _how_ she was ever going to be happy there , knowing the mother and the children war n't ever going to see each other no more -- and then busted out bitterer than ever , and flung up her hands , and says : Oh , dear , dear , to think they ai n't _ever_ going to see each other any more ! 
But they _will_ -- and inside of two weeks -- and I _know_ it ! 
says I . 
Laws , it was out before I could think ! 
And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_ , say it _again_ , say it _again_ ! 
I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much , and was in a close place . 
I asked her to let me think a minute ; and she set there , very impatient and excited and handsome , but looking kind of happy and eased-up , like a person that 's had a tooth pulled out . 
So I went to studying it out . 
I says to myself , I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks , though I ai n't had no experience , and ca n't say for certain ; but it looks so to me , anyway ; and yet here 's a case where I 'm blest if it do n't look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie . 
I must lay it by in my mind , and think it over some time or other , it's so kind of strange and unregular . 
I never see nothing like it . 
Well , I says to myself at last , I 'm a-going to chance it ; I 'll up and tell the truth this time , though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you 'll go to . 
Then I says : Miss Mary Jane , is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days ? 
Yes ; Mr. Lothrop 's . 
Why ? 
Never mind why yet . 
If I 'll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks -- here in this house -- and _prove_ how I know it -- will you go to Mr. Lothrop 's and stay four days ? 
Four days ! 
she says ; I 'll stay a year ! 
All right , I says , I do n't want nothing more out of _you_ than just your word -- I druther have it than another man 's kiss-the-Bible . 
She smiled and reddened up very sweet , and I says , If you do n't mind it , I 'll shut the door -- and bolt it . 
Then I come back and set down again , and says : Do n't you holler . 
Just set still and take it like a man . 
I got to tell the truth , and you want to brace up , Miss Mary , because it 's a bad kind , and going to be hard to take , but there ai n't no help for it . 
These uncles of yourn ai n't no uncles at all ; they 're a couple of frauds -- regular dead-beats . 
There , now we 're over the worst of it , you can stand the rest middling easy . 
It jolted her up like everything , of course ; but I was over the shoal water now , so I went right along , her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time , and told her every blame thing , from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat , clear through to where she flung herself on to the king 's breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times -- and then up she jumps , with her face afire like sunset , and says : The brute ! 
Come , do n't waste a minute -- not a _second_ -- we 'll have them tarred and feathered , and flung in the river ! 
Says I : Cert'nly . 
But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop 's , or -- Oh , she says , what am I _thinking_ about ! 
she says , and set right down again . 
Do n't mind what I said -- please do n't -- you _wo n't , _ now , _will_ you ? 
Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would die first . 
I never thought , I was so stirred up , she says ; now go on , and I wo n't do so any more . 
You tell me what to do , and whatever you say I 'll do it . 
Well , I says , it 's a rough gang , them two frauds , and I 'm fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer , whether I want to or not -- I druther not tell you why ; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws , and I 'd be all right ; but there 'd be another person that you do n't know about who 'd be in big trouble . 
Well , we got to save _him_ , hai n't we ? 
Of course . 
Well , then , we wo n't blow on them . 
Saying them words put a good idea in my head . 
I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds ; get them jailed here , and then leave . 
But I did n't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me ; so I did n't want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night . 
I says : Miss Mary Jane , I 'll tell you what we 'll do , and you wo n't have to stay at Mr. Lothrop 's so long , nuther . 
How fur is it ? 
A little short of four miles -- right out in the country , back here . 
Well , that 'll answer . 
Now you go along out there , and lay low till nine or half-past to-night , and then get them to fetch you home again -- tell them you 've thought of something . 
If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window , and if I do n't turn up wait _till_ eleven , and _then_ if I do n't turn up it means I 'm gone , and out of the way , and safe . 
Then you come out and spread the news around , and get these beats jailed . 
Good , she says , I 'll do it . 
And if it just happens so that I do n't get away , but get took up along with them , you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand , and you must stand by me all you can . 
Stand by you ! 
indeed I will . 
They sha ' n't touch a hair of your head ! 
she says , and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it , too . 
If I get away I sha ' n't be here , I says , to prove these rapscallions ai n't your uncles , and I could n't do it if I _was_ here . 
I could swear they was beats and bummers , that 's all , though that 's worth something . 
Well , there 's others can do that better than what I can , and they're people that ai n't going to be doubted as quick as I 'd be . 
I 'll tell you how to find them . 
Gim me a pencil and a piece of paper . 
There -- 'Royal Nonesuch , Bricksville . ' 
Put it away , and do n't lose it . 
When the court wants to find out something about these two , let them send up to Bricksville and say they 've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch , and ask for some witnesses -- why , you 'll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink , Miss Mary . 
And they 'll come a-biling , too . 
I judged we had got everything fixed about right now . 
So I says : Just let the auction go right along , and do n't worry . 
Nobody don't have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice , and they ai n't going out of this till they get that money ; and the way we 've fixed it the sale ai n't going to count , and they ai n't going to get no money . 
It 's just like the way it was with the niggers -- it war n't no sale , and the niggers will be back before long . 
Why , they ca n't collect the money for the _niggers_ yet -- they 're in the worst kind of a fix , Miss Mary . 
Well , she says , I 'll run down to breakfast now , and then I 'll start straight for Mr. Lothrop 's . 
'Deed , _that_ ai n't the ticket , Miss Mary Jane , I says , by no manner of means ; go _before_ breakfast . 
Why ? 
What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for , Miss Mary ? 
Well , I never thought -- and come to think , I do n't know . 
What was it ? 
Why , it 's because you ai n't one of these leather-face people . 
I don't want no better book than what your face is . 
A body can set down and read it off like coarse print . 
Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning , and never -- There , there , do n't ! 
Yes , I 'll go before breakfast -- I 'll be glad to . 
And leave my sisters with them ? 
Yes ; never mind about them . 
They 've got to stand it yet a while . 
They might suspicion something if all of you was to go . 
I do n't want you to see them , nor your sisters , nor nobody in this town ; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something . 
No , you go right along , Miss Mary Jane , and I 'll fix it with all of them . 
I 'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you 've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change , or to see a friend , and you 'll be back to-night or early in the morning . 
Gone to see a friend is all right , but I wo n't have my love given to them . 
Well , then , it sha ' n't be . 
It was well enough to tell _her_ so -- no harm in it . 
It was only a little thing to do , and no trouble ; and it's the little things that smooths people 's roads the most , down here below ; it would make Mary Jane comfortable , and it would n't cost nothing . 
Then I says : There 's one more thing -- that bag of money . 
Well , they 've got that ; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think _how_ they got it . 
No , you 're out , there . 
They hai n't got it . 
Why , who 's got it ? 
I wish I knowed , but I do n't . 
I _had_ it , because I stole it from them ; and I stole it to give to you ; and I know where I hid it , but I'm afraid it ai n't there no more . 
I 'm awful sorry , Miss Mary Jane , I'm just as sorry as I can be ; but I done the best I could ; I did honest . 
I come nigh getting caught , and I had to shove it into the first place I come to , and run -- and it war n't a good place . 
Oh , stop blaming yourself -- it 's too bad to do it , and I wo n't allow it -- you could n't help it ; it was n't your fault . 
Where did you hide it ? 
I did n't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again ; and I could n't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach . 
So for a minute I did n't say nothing ; then I says : I 'd ruther not _tell_ you where I put it , Miss Mary Jane , if you don't mind letting me off ; but I 'll write it for you on a piece of paper , and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop 's , if you want to . 
Do you reckon that 'll do ? 
Oh , yes . 
So I wrote : I put it in the coffin . 
It was in there when you was crying there , away in the night . 
I was behind the door , and I was mighty sorry for you , Miss Mary Jane . 
It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night , and them devils laying there right under her own roof , shaming her and robbing her ; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes , too ; and she shook me by the hand , hard , and says : _Good_-bye . 
I 'm going to do everything just as you 've told me ; and if I do n't ever see you again , I sha ' n't ever forget you and I 'll think of you a many and a many a time , and I 'll _pray_ for you , too ! -- and she was gone . 
Pray for me ! 
I reckoned if she knowed me she 'd take a job that was more nearer her size . 
But I bet she done it , just the same -- she was just that kind . 
She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion -- there war n't no back-down to her , I judge . 
You may say what you want to , but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see ; in my opinion she was just full of sand . 
It sounds like flattery , but it ai n't no flattery . 
And when it comes to beauty -- and goodness , too -- she lays over them all . 
I hai n't ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door ; no , I hai n't ever seen her since , but I reckon I 've thought of her a many and a many a million times , and of her saying she would pray for me ; and if ever I 'd a thought it would do any good for me to pray for _her_ , blamed if I would n't a done it or bust . 
Well , Mary Jane she lit out the back way , I reckon ; because nobody see her go . 
When I struck Susan and the hare-lip , I says : What 's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes ? 
They says : There 's several ; but it 's the Proctors , mainly . 
That 's the name , I says ; I most forgot it . 
Well , Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she 's gone over there in a dreadful hurry -- one of them 's sick . 
Which one ? 
I do n't know ; leastways , I kinder forget ; but I thinks it 's -- Sakes alive , I hope it ai n't _Hanner_ ? 
I 'm sorry to say it , I says , but Hanner 's the very one . 
My goodness , and she so well only last week ! 
Is she took bad ? 
It ai n't no name for it . 
They set up with her all night , Miss Mary Jane said , and they do n't think she 'll last many hours . 
Only think of that , now ! 
What 's the matter with her ? 
I could n't think of anything reasonable , right off that way , so I says : Mumps . 
Mumps your granny ! 
They do n't set up with people that 's got the mumps . 
They do n't , do n't they ? 
You better bet they do with _these_ mumps . 
These mumps is different . 
It 's a new kind , Miss Mary Jane said . 
How 's it a new kind ? 
Because it 's mixed up with other things . 
What other things ? 
Well , measles , and whooping-cough , and erysiplas , and consumption , and yaller janders , and brain-fever , and I do n't know what all . 
My land ! 
And they call it the _mumps_ ? 
That 's what Miss Mary Jane said . 
Well , what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for ? 
Why , because it _is_ the mumps . 
That 's what it starts with . 
Well , ther ' ai n't no sense in it . 
A body might stump his toe , and take pison , and fall down the well , and break his neck , and bust his brains out , and somebody come along and ask what killed him , and some numskull up and say , 'Why , he stumped his _toe_ . ' 
Would ther ' be any sense in that ? 
_No_ . 
And ther ' ai n't no sense in _this_ , nuther . 
Is it ketching ? 
Is it _ketching_ ? 
Why , how you talk . 
Is a _harrow_ catching -- in the dark ? 
If you do n't hitch on to one tooth , you 're bound to on another , ai n't you ? 
And you ca n't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along , can you ? 
Well , these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow , as you may say -- and it ai n't no slouch of a harrow , nuther , you come to get it hitched on good . 
Well , it 's awful , I think , says the hare-lip . 
I 'll go to Uncle Harvey and -- Oh , yes , I says , I _would_ . 
Of _course_ I would . 
I would n't lose no time . 
Well , why would n't you ? 
Just look at it a minute , and maybe you can see . 
Hai n't your uncles obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can ? 
And do you reckon they 'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves ? 
_you_ know they 'll wait for you . 
So fur , so good . 
Your uncle Harvey 's a preacher , ai n't he ? 
Very well , then ; is a _preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk ? 
is he going to deceive a _ship clerk ? _ -- so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard ? 
Now _you_ know he ai n't . 
What _will_ he do , then ? 
Why , he 'll say , 'It 's a great pity , but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can ; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps , and so it 's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she 's got it . ' 
But never mind , if you think it 's best to tell your uncle Harvey -- Shucks , and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane's got it or not ? 
Why , you talk like a muggins . 
Well , anyway , maybe you 'd better tell some of the neighbors . 
Listen at that , now . 
You do beat all for natural stupidness . 
Can't you _see_ that _they'd_ go and tell ? 
Ther ' ai n't no way but just to not tell anybody at _all_ . 
Well , maybe you 're right -- yes , I judge you _are_ right . 
But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she 's gone out a while , anyway , so he wo n't be uneasy about her ? 
Yes , Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that . 
She says , 'Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss , and say I 've run over the river to see Mr. ' -- Mr. -- what _is_ the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much of ? -- I mean the one that -- Why , you must mean the Apthorps , ai n't it ? 
Of course ; bother them kind of names , a body ca n't ever seem to remember them , half the time , somehow . 
Yes , she said , say she has run over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house , because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody else ; and she 's going to stick to them till they say they 'll come , and then , if she ai n't too tired , she 's coming home ; and if she is , she 'll be home in the morning anyway . 
She said , do n't say nothing about the Proctors , but only about the Apthorps -- which 'll be perfectly true , because she is going there to speak about their buying the house ; I know it , because she told me so herself . 
All right , they said , and cleared out to lay for their uncles , and give them the love and the kisses , and tell them the message . 
Everything was all right now . 
The girls would n't say nothing because they wanted to go to England ; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor Robinson . 
I felt very good ; I judged I had done it pretty neat -- I reckoned Tom Sawyer could n't a done it no neater himself . 
Of course he would a throwed more style into it , but I ca n't do that very handy , not being brung up to it . 
Well , they held the auction in the public square , along towards the end of the afternoon , and it strung along , and strung along , and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest , up there longside of the auctioneer , and chipping in a little Scripture now and then , or a little goody-goody saying of some kind , and the duke he was around goo-gooing for sympathy all he knowed how , and just spreading himself generly . 
But by and by the thing dragged through , and everything was sold -- everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard . 
So they 'd got to work that off -- I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow _everything_ . 
Well , whilst they was at it a steamboat landed , and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on , and singing out : _Here's_ your opposition line ! 
here 's your two sets o ' heirs to old Peter Wilks -- and you pays your money and you takes your choice ! 
. 
THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along , and a nice-looking younger one , with his right arm in a sling . 
And , my souls , how the people yelled and laughed , and kept it up . 
But I did n't see no joke about it , and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any . 
I reckoned they 'd turn pale . 
But no , nary a pale did _they_ turn . 
The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up , but just went a goo-gooing around , happy and satisfied , like a jug that's googling out buttermilk ; and as for the king , he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world . 
Oh , he done it admirable . 
Lots of the principal people gethered around the king , to let him see they was on his side . 
That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death . 
Pretty soon he begun to speak , and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an Englishman -- not the king 's way , though the king 's _was_ pretty good for an imitation . 
I ca n't give the old gent 's words , nor I ca n't imitate him ; but he turned around to the crowd , and says , about like this : This is a surprise to me which I was n't looking for ; and I'll acknowledge , candid and frank , I ai n't very well fixed to meet it and answer it ; for my brother and me has had misfortunes ; he 's broke his arm , and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake . 
I am Peter Wilks ' brother Harvey , and this is his brother William , which ca n't hear nor speak -- and ca n't even make signs to amount to much , now't he 's only got one hand to work them with . 
We are who we say we are ; and in a day or two , when I get the baggage , I can prove it . 
But up till then I wo n't say nothing more , but go to the hotel and wait . 
So him and the new dummy started off ; and the king he laughs , and blethers out : Broke his arm -- _very_ likely , _ain't_ it ? -- and very convenient , too , for a fraud that 's got to make signs , and ai n't learnt how . 
Lost their baggage ! 
That 's _mighty_ good ! -- and mighty ingenious -- under the _circumstances_ ! 
So he laughed again ; and so did everybody else , except three or four , or maybe half a dozen . 
One of these was that doctor ; another one was a sharp-looking gentleman , with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made out of carpet-stuff , that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice , and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their heads -- it was Levi Bell , the lawyer that was gone up to Louisville ; and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said , and was listening to the king now . 
And when the king got done this husky up and says : Say , looky here ; if you are Harvey Wilks , when 'd you come to this town ? 
The day before the funeral , friend , says the king . 
But what time o ' day ? 
In the evenin ' -- 'bout an hour er two before sundown . 
_How'd_ you come ? 
I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati . 
Well , then , how 'd you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_ ' -- in a canoe ? 
I war n't up at the Pint in the mornin ' . 
It 's a lie . 
Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher . 
Preacher be hanged , he 's a fraud and a liar . 
He was up at the Pint that mornin ' . 
I live up there , do n't I ? 
Well , I was up there , and he was up there . 
I see him there . 
He come in a canoe , along with Tim Collins and a boy . 
The doctor he up and says : Would you know the boy again if you was to see him , Hines ? 
I reckon I would , but I do n't know . 
Why , yonder he is , now . 
I know him perfectly easy . 
It was me he pointed at . 
The doctor says : Neighbors , I do n't know whether the new couple is frauds or not ; but if _these_ two ai n't frauds , I am an idiot , that 's all . 
I think it 's our duty to see that they do n't get away from here till we 've looked into this thing . 
Come along , Hines ; come along , the rest of you . 
We 'll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple , and I reckon we 'll find out _something_ before we get through . 
It was nuts for the crowd , though maybe not for the king 's friends ; so we all started . 
It was about sundown . 
The doctor he led me along by the hand , and was plenty kind enough , but he never let go my hand . 
We all got in a big room in the hotel , and lit up some candles , and fetched in the new couple . 
First , the doctor says : I do n't wish to be too hard on these two men , but I think they're frauds , and they may have complices that we do n't know nothing about . 
If they have , wo n't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left ? 
It ai n't unlikely . 
If these men ai n't frauds , they won't object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they 're all right -- ai n't that so ? 
Everybody agreed to that . 
So I judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart . 
But the king he only looked sorrowful , and says : Gentlemen , I wish the money was there , for I ai n't got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair , open , out-and-out investigation o ' this misable business ; but , alas , the money ai n't there ; you k ' n send and see , if you want to . 
Where is it , then ? 
Well , when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it inside o ' the straw tick o ' my bed , not wishin ' to bank it for the few days we 'd be here , and considerin ' the bed a safe place , we not bein' used to niggers , and suppos ' n ' 'em honest , like servants in England . 
The niggers stole it the very next mornin ' after I had went down stairs ; and when I sold 'em I had n't missed the money yit , so they got clean away with it . 
My servant here k ' n tell you 'bout it , gentlemen . 
The doctor and several said Shucks ! 
and I see nobody did n't altogether believe him . 
One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it . 
I said no , but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away , and I never thought nothing , only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them . 
That was all they asked me . 
Then the doctor whirls on me and says : Are _you_ English , too ? 
I says yes ; and him and some others laughed , and said , Stuff ! 
Well , then they sailed in on the general investigation , and there we had it , up and down , hour in , hour out , and nobody never said a word about supper , nor ever seemed to think about it -- and so they kept it up , and kept it up ; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see . 
They made the king tell his yarn , and they made the old gentleman tell his ' n ; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies . 
And by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed . 
The king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye , and so I knowed enough to talk on the right side . 
I begun to tell about Sheffield , and how we lived there , and all about the English Wilkses , and so on ; but I did n't get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh ; and Levi Bell , the lawyer , says : Set down , my boy ; I would n't strain myself if I was you . 
I reckon you ai n't used to lying , it do n't seem to come handy ; what you want is practice . 
You do it pretty awkward . 
I did n't care nothing for the compliment , but I was glad to be let off , anyway . 
The doctor he started to say something , and turns and says : If you 'd been in town at first , Levi Bell -- The king broke in and reached out his hand , and says : Why , is this my poor dead brother 's old friend that he 's wrote so often about ? 
The lawyer and him shook hands , and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased , and they talked right along awhile , and then got to one side and talked low ; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says : That 'll fix it . 
I 'll take the order and send it , along with your brother 's , and then they 'll know it 's all right . 
So they got some paper and a pen , and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side , and chawed his tongue , and scrawled off something ; and then they give the pen to the duke -- and then for the first time the duke looked sick . 
But he took the pen and wrote . 
So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says : You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names . 
The old gentleman wrote , but nobody could n't read it . 
The lawyer looked powerful astonished , and says : Well , it beats _me_ -- and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket , and examined them , and then examined the old man 's writing , and then _them_ again ; and then says : These old letters is from Harvey Wilks ; and here 's _these_ two handwritings , and anybody can see they didn't write them ( the king and the duke looked sold and foolish , I tell you , to see how the lawyer had took them in ) , and here 's _this_ old gentleman 's hand writing , and anybody can tell , easy enough , _he_ didn't write them -- fact is , the scratches he makes ai n't properly _writing_ at all . 
Now , here 's some letters from -- The new old gentleman says : If you please , let me explain . 
Nobody can read my hand but my brother there -- so he copies for me . 
It 's _his_ hand you 've got there , not mine . 
_Well_ ! 
says the lawyer , this _is_ a state of things . 
I 've got some of William 's letters , too ; so if you 'll get him to write a line or so we can com -- He _can't_ write with his left hand , says the old gentleman . 
If he could use his right hand , you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too . 
Look at both , please -- they 're by the same hand . 
The lawyer done it , and says : I believe it 's so -- and if it ai n't so , there 's a heap stronger resemblance than I 'd noticed before , anyway . 
Well , well , well ! 
I thought we was right on the track of a solution , but it 's gone to grass , partly . 
But anyway , one thing is proved -- _these_ two ai n't either of 'em Wilkses -- and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke . 
Well , what do you think ? 
That muleheaded old fool would n't give in _then_ ! 
Indeed he would n't . 
Said it war n't no fair test . 
Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world , and had n't tried to write -- _he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper . 
And so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying _himself_ ; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in , and says : I 've thought of something . 
Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br -- helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying ? 
Yes , says somebody , me and Ab Turner done it . 
We 're both here . 
Then the old man turns towards the king , and says : Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast ? 
Blamed if the king did n't have to brace up mighty quick , or he 'd a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under , it took him so sudden ; and , mind you , it was a thing that was calculated to make most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice , because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man ? 
He whitened a little ; he could n't help it ; and it was mighty still in there , and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him . 
Says I to myself , _now_ he 'll throw up the sponge -- there ai n't no more use . 
Well , did he ? 
A body ca n't hardly believe it , but he did n't . 
I reckon he thought he 'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out , so they 'd thin out , and him and the duke could break loose and get away . 
Anyway , he set there , and pretty soon he begun to smile , and says : Mf ! 
It 's a _very_ tough question , _ain't_ it ! 
_yes_ , sir , I k ' n tell you what 's tattooed on his breast . 
It 's jest a small , thin , blue arrow -- that 's what it is ; and if you do n't look clost , you ca n't see it . 
_now_ what do you say -- hey ? 
Well , I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek . 
The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard , and his eye lights up like he judged he 'd got the king _this_ time , and says : There -- you 've heard what he said ! 
Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks ' breast ? 
Both of them spoke up and says : We did n't see no such mark . 
Good ! 
says the old gentleman . 
Now , what you _did_ see on his breast was a small dim P , and a B ( which is an initial he dropped when he was young ) , and a W , with dashes between them , so : P -- B -- W -- and he marked them that way on a piece of paper . 
Come , ai n't that what you saw ? 
Both of them spoke up again , and says : No , we _didn't_ . 
We never seen any marks at all . 
Well , everybody _was_ in a state of mind now , and they sings out : The whole _bilin_ ' of 'm 's frauds ! 
Le 's duck 'em ! 
le 's drown 'em ! 
le 's ride 'em on a rail ! 
and everybody was whooping at once , and there was a rattling powwow . 
But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells , and says : Gentlemen -- gentle_men ! _ Hear me just a word -- just a _single_ word -- if you _please_ ! 
There 's one way yet -- let 's go and dig up the corpse and look . 
That took them . 
Hooray ! 
they all shouted , and was starting right off ; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out : Hold on , hold on ! 
Collar all these four men and the boy , and fetch _them_ along , too ! 
We 'll do it ! 
they all shouted ; and if we do n't find them marks we'll lynch the whole gang ! 
I _was_ scared , now , I tell you . 
But there war n't no getting away , you know . 
They gripped us all , and marched us right along , straight for the graveyard , which was a mile and a half down the river , and the whole town at our heels , for we made noise enough , and it was only nine in the evening . 
As we went by our house I wished I had n't sent Mary Jane out of town ; because now if I could tip her the wink she 'd light out and save me , and blow on our dead-beats . 
Well , we swarmed along down the river road , just carrying on like wildcats ; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up , and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter , and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves . 
This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in ; and I was kinder stunned ; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for ; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to , and see all the fun , and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come , here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks . 
If they did n't find them -- I could n't bear to think about it ; and yet , somehow , I could n't think about nothing else . 
It got darker and darker , and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip ; but that big husky had me by the wrist -- Hines -- and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip . 
He dragged me right along , he was so excited , and I had to run to keep up . 
When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow . 
And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted , but nobody hadn't thought to fetch a lantern . 
But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning , and sent a man to the nearest house , a half a mile off , to borrow one . 
So they dug and dug like everything ; and it got awful dark , and the rain started , and the wind swished and swushed along , and the lightning come brisker and brisker , and the thunder boomed ; but them people never took no notice of it , they was so full of this business ; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd , and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave , and the next second the dark wiped it all out , and you could n't see nothing at all . 
At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid , and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was , to scrouge in and get a sight , you never see ; and in the dark , that way , it was awful . 
Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so , and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world , he was so excited and panting . 
All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare , and somebody sings out : By the living jingo , here 's the bag of gold on his breast ! 
Hines let out a whoop , like everybody else , and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look , and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ai n't nobody can tell . 
I had the road all to myself , and I fairly flew -- leastways , I had it all to myself except the solid dark , and the now-and-then glares , and the buzzing of the rain , and the thrashing of the wind , and the splitting of the thunder ; and sure as you are born I did clip it along ! 
When I struck the town I see there war n't nobody out in the storm , so I never hunted for no back streets , but humped it straight through the main one ; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it . 
No light there ; the house all dark -- which made me feel sorry and disappointed , I did n't know why . 
But at last , just as I was sailing by , _flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane 's window ! 
and my heart swelled up sudden , like to bust ; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark , and was n't ever going to be before me no more in this world . 
She _was_ the best girl I ever see , and had the most sand . 
The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the towhead , I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow , and the first time the lightning showed me one that was n't chained I snatched it and shoved . 
It was a canoe , and war n't fastened with nothing but a rope . 
The towhead was a rattling big distance off , away out there in the middle of the river , but I did n't lose no time ; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it . 
But I did n't . 
As I sprung aboard I sung out : Out with you , Jim , and set her loose ! 
Glory be to goodness , we 're shut of them ! 
Jim lit out , and was a-coming for me with both arms spread , he was so full of joy ; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards ; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one , and it most scared the livers and lights out of me . 
But Jim fished me out , and was going to hug me and bless me , and so on , he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke , but I says : Not now ; have it for breakfast , have it for breakfast ! 
Cut loose and let her slide ! 
So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river , and it _did_ seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river , and nobody to bother us . 
I had to skip around a bit , and jump up and crack my heels a few times -- I could n't help it ; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well , and held my breath and listened and waited ; and sure enough , when the next flash busted out over the water , here they come ! -- and just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff hum ! 
It was the king and the duke . 
So I wilted right down on to the planks then , and give up ; and it was all I could do to keep from crying . 
. 
WHEN they got aboard the king went for me , and shook me by the collar , and says : Tryin ' to give us the slip , was ye , you pup ! 
Tired of our company , hey ? 
I says : No , your majesty , we war n't -- _please_ do n't , your majesty ! 
Quick , then , and tell us what _was_ your idea , or I 'll shake the insides out o ' you ! 
Honest , I 'll tell you everything just as it happened , your majesty . 
The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me , and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year , and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix ; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold , and made a rush for the coffin , he lets go of me and whispers , 'Heel it now , or they 'll hang ye , sure ! ' 
and I lit out . 
It did n't seem no good for _me_ to stay -- I could n't do nothing , and I did n't want to be hung if I could get away . 
So I never stopped running till I found the canoe ; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry , or they 'd catch me and hang me yet , and said I was afeard you and the duke was n't alive now , and I was awful sorry , and so was Jim , and was awful glad when we see you coming ; you may ask Jim if I did n't . 
Jim said it was so ; and the king told him to shut up , and said , Oh , yes , it 's _mighty_ likely ! 
and shook me up again , and said he reckoned he 'd drownd me . 
But the duke says : Leggo the boy , you old idiot ! 
Would _you_ a done any different ? 
Did you inquire around for _him_ when you got loose ? 
I do n't remember it . 
So the king let go of me , and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it . 
But the duke says : You better a blame ' sight give _yourself_ a good cussing , for you're the one that 's entitled to it most . 
You hai n't done a thing from the start that had any sense in it , except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark . 
That _was_ bright -- it was right down bully ; and it was the thing that saved us . 
For if it had n't been for that they 'd a jailed us till them Englishmen 's baggage come -- and then -- the penitentiary , you bet ! 
But that trick took 'em to the graveyard , and the gold done us a still bigger kindness ; for if the excited fools had n't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we 'd a slept in our cravats to-night -- cravats warranted to _wear_ , too -- longer than _we'd_ need 'em . 
They was still a minute -- thinking ; then the king says , kind of absent-minded like : Mf ! 
And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it ! 
That made me squirm ! 
Yes , says the duke , kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic , _we_ did . 
After about a half a minute the king drawls out : Leastways , I did . 
The duke says , the same way : On the contrary , I did . 
The king kind of ruffles up , and says : Looky here , Bilgewater , what ' r you referrin ' to ? 
The duke says , pretty brisk : When it comes to that , maybe you 'll let me ask , what was _you_ referring to ? 
Shucks ! 
says the king , very sarcastic ; but I do n't know -- maybe you was asleep , and did n't know what you was about . 
The duke bristles up now , and says : Oh , let _up_ on this cussed nonsense ; do you take me for a blame ' fool ? 
Do n't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin ? 
_Yes_ , sir ! 
I know you _do_ know , because you done it yourself ! 
It 's a lie ! -- and the duke went for him . 
The king sings out : Take y ' r hands off ! -- leggo my throat ! -- I take it all back ! 
The duke says : Well , you just own up , first , that you _did_ hide that money there , intending to give me the slip one of these days , and come back and dig it up , and have it all to yourself . 
Wait jest a minute , duke -- answer me this one question , honest and fair ; if you did n't put the money there , say it , and I 'll b'lieve you , and take back everything I said . 
You old scoundrel , I did n't , and you know I did n't . 
There , now ! 
Well , then , I b'lieve you . 
But answer me only jest this one more -- now _don't_ git mad ; did n't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it ? 
The duke never said nothing for a little bit ; then he says : Well , I do n't care if I _did_ , I did n't _do_ it , anyway . 
But you not only had it in mind to do it , but you _done_ it . 
I wisht I never die if I done it , duke , and that 's honest . 
I wo n't say I war n't goin ' to do it , because I _was_ ; but you -- I mean somebody -- got in ahead o ' me . 
It 's a lie ! 
You done it , and you got to _say_ you done it , or -- The king began to gurgle , and then he gasps out : 'Nough ! -- I _own up ! _ I was very glad to hear him say that ; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before . 
So the duke took his hands off and says : If you ever deny it again I 'll drown you . 
It 's _well_ for you to set there and blubber like a baby -- it 's fitten for you , after the way you 've acted . 
I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything -- and I a-trusting you all the time , like you was my own father . 
You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers , and you never say a word for 'em . 
It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_ that rubbage . 
Cuss you , I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit -- you wanted to get what money I 'd got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another , and scoop it _all_ ! 
The king says , timid , and still a-snuffling : Why , duke , it was you that said make up the deffisit ; it war n't me . 
Dry up ! 
I do n't want to hear no more out of you ! 
says the duke . 
And _now_ you see what you GOT by it . 
They 've got all their own money back , and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_ . 
G'long to bed , and do n't you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits , long 's _you_ live ! 
So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort , and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle ; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again , and the tighter they got the lovinger they got , and went off a-snoring in each other 's arms . 
They both got powerful mellow , but I noticed the king did n't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again . 
That made me feel easy and satisfied . 
Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble , and I told Jim everything . 
. 
WE das n't stop again at any town for days and days ; kept right along down the river . 
We was down south in the warm weather now , and a mighty long ways from home . 
We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them , hanging down from the limbs like long , gray beards . 
It was the first I ever see it growing , and it made the woods look solemn and dismal . 
So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger , and they begun to work the villages again . 
First they done a lecture on temperance ; but they did n't make enough for them both to get drunk on . 
Then in another village they started a dancing-school ; but they did n't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does ; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town . 
Another time they tried to go at yellocution ; but they did n't yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing , and made them skip out . 
They tackled missionarying , and mesmerizing , and doctoring , and telling fortunes , and a little of everything ; but they could n't seem to have no luck . 
So at last they got just about dead broke , and laid around the raft as she floated along , thinking and thinking , and never saying nothing , by the half a day at a time , and dreadful blue and desperate . 
And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time . 
Jim and me got uneasy . 
We did n't like the look of it . 
We judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever . 
We turned it over and over , and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody 's house or store , or was going into the counterfeit-money business , or something . 
So then we was pretty scared , and made up an agreement that we would n't have nothing in the world to do with such actions , and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind . 
Well , early one morning we hid the raft in a good , safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville , and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet . 
( House to rob , you _mean_ , says I to myself ; and when you get through robbing it you 'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft -- and you 'll have to take it out in wondering . ) 
And he said if he war n't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right , and we was to come along . 
So we stayed where we was . 
The duke he fretted and sweated around , and was in a mighty sour way . 
He scolded us for everything , and we couldn't seem to do nothing right ; he found fault with every little thing . 
Something was a-brewing , sure . 
I was good and glad when midday come and no king ; we could have a change , anyway -- and maybe a chance for _the_ change on top of it . 
So me and the duke went up to the village , and hunted around there for the king , and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery , very tight , and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport , and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all his might , and so tight he could n't walk , and could n't do nothing to them . 
The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool , and the king begun to sass back , and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs , and spun down the river road like a deer , for I see our chance ; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again . 
I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy , and sung out : Set her loose , Jim ! 
we 're all right now ! 
But there war n't no answer , and nobody come out of the wigwam . 
Jim was gone ! 
I set up a shout -- and then another -- and then another one ; and run this way and that in the woods , whooping and screeching ; but it warn't no use -- old Jim was gone . 
Then I set down and cried ; I could n't help it . 
But I could n't set still long . 
Pretty soon I went out on the road , trying to think what I better do , and I run across a boy walking , and asked him if he 'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so , and he says : Yes . 
Whereabouts ? 
says I . 
Down to Silas Phelps ' place , two mile below here . 
He 's a runaway nigger , and they 've got him . 
Was you looking for him ? 
You bet I ai n't ! 
I run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago , and he said if I hollered he 'd cut my livers out -- and told me to lay down and stay where I was ; and I done it . 
Been there ever since ; afeard to come out . 
Well , he says , you need n't be afeard no more , becuz they 've got him . 
He run off f 'm down South , som'ers . 
It 's a good job they got him . 
Well , I _reckon_ ! 
There 's two hunderd dollars reward on him . 
It's like picking up money out ' n the road . 
Yes , it is -- and I could a had it if I 'd been big enough ; I see him _first_ . 
Who nailed him ? 
It was an old fellow -- a stranger -- and he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars , becuz he 's got to go up the river and ca n't wait . 
Think o ' that , now ! 
You bet _I'd_ wait , if it was seven year . 
That 's me , every time , says I . 
But maybe his chance ai n't worth no more than that , if he 'll sell it so cheap . 
Maybe there 's something ai n't straight about it . 
But it _is_ , though -- straight as a string . 
I see the handbill myself . 
It tells all about him , to a dot -- paints him like a picture , and tells the plantation he 's frum , below Newr_leans_ . 
No-sirree-_bob_ , they ai n't no trouble 'bout _that_ speculation , you bet you . 
Say , gim me a chaw tobacker , wo n't ye ? 
I did n't have none , so he left . 
I went to the raft , and set down in the wigwam to think . 
But I could n't come to nothing . 
I thought till I wore my head sore , but I could n't see no way out of the trouble . 
After all this long journey , and after all we 'd done for them scoundrels , here it was all come to nothing , everything all busted up and ruined , because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that , and make him a slave again all his life , and amongst strangers , too , for forty dirty dollars . 
Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family was , as long as he 'd _got_ to be a slave , and so I 'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was . 
But I soon give up that notion for two things : she 'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her , and so she 'd sell him straight down the river again ; and if she did n't , everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger , and they 'd make Jim feel it all the time , and so he 'd feel ornery and disgraced . 
And then think of _me_ ! 
It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom ; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I 'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame . 
That 's just the way : a person does a low-down thing , and then he do n't want to take no consequences of it . 
Thinks as long as he can hide it , it ai n't no disgrace . 
That was my fix exactly . 
The more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me , and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling . 
And at last , when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven , whilst I was stealing a poor old woman 's nigger that had n't ever done me no harm , and now was showing me there 's One that 's always on the lookout , and ai n't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further , I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared . 
Well , I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked , and so I war n't so much to blame ; but something inside of me kept saying , There was the Sunday-school , you could a gone to it ; and if you 'd a done it they 'd a learnt you there that people that acts as I 'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire . 
It made me shiver . 
And I about made up my mind to pray , and see if I could n't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better . 
So I kneeled down . 
But the words would n't come . 
Why would n't they ? 
It war n't no use to try and hide it from Him . 
Nor from _me_ , neither . 
I knowed very well why they would n't come . 
It was because my heart warn't right ; it was because I war n't square ; it was because I was playing double . 
I was letting _on_ to give up sin , but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all . 
I was trying to make my mouth _say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing , and go and write to that nigger 's owner and tell where he was ; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie , and He knowed it . 
You ca n't pray a lie -- I found that out . 
So I was full of trouble , full as I could be ; and did n't know what to do . 
At last I had an idea ; and I says , I 'll go and write the letter -- and then see if I can pray . 
Why , it was astonishing , the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off , and my troubles all gone . 
So I got a piece of paper and a pencil , all glad and excited , and set down and wrote : Miss Watson , your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville , and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send . 
_Huck Finn._ I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life , and I knowed I could pray now . 
But I did n't do it straight off , but laid the paper down and set there thinking -- thinking how good it was all this happened so , and how near I come to being lost and going to hell . 
And went on thinking . 
And got to thinking over our trip down the river ; and I see Jim before me all the time : in the day and in the night-time , sometimes moonlight , sometimes storms , and we a-floating along , talking and singing and laughing . 
But somehow I could n't seem to strike no places to harden me against him , but only the other kind . 
I 'd see him standing my watch on top of his ' n , 'stead of calling me , so I could go on sleeping ; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog ; and when I come to him again in the swamp , up there where the feud was ; and such-like times ; and would always call me honey , and pet me and do everything he could think of for me , and how good he always was ; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard , and he was so grateful , and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world , and the _only_ one he's got now ; and then I happened to look around and see that paper . 
It was a close place . 
I took it up , and held it in my hand . 
I was a-trembling , because I 'd got to decide , forever , betwixt two things , and I knowed it . 
I studied a minute , sort of holding my breath , and then says to myself : All right , then , I 'll _go_ to hell -- and tore it up . 
It was awful thoughts and awful words , but they was said . 
And I let them stay said ; and never thought no more about reforming . 
I shoved the whole thing out of my head , and said I would take up wickedness again , which was in my line , being brung up to it , and the other war n't . 
And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again ; and if I could think up anything worse , I would do that , too ; because as long as I was in , and in for good , I might as well go the whole hog . 
Then I set to thinking over how to get at it , and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind ; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me . 
So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece , and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it , and hid it there , and then turned in . 
I slept the night through , and got up before it was light , and had my breakfast , and put on my store clothes , and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle , and took the canoe and cleared for shore . 
I landed below where I judged was Phelps 's place , and hid my bundle in the woods , and then filled up the canoe with water , and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her , about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank . 
Then I struck up the road , and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it , Phelps 's Sawmill , and when I come to the farm-houses , two or three hundred yards further along , I kept my eyes peeled , but didn't see nobody around , though it was good daylight now . 
But I did n't mind , because I did n't want to see nobody just yet -- I only wanted to get the lay of the land . 
According to my plan , I was going to turn up there from the village , not from below . 
So I just took a look , and shoved along , straight for town . 
Well , the very first man I see when I got there was the duke . 
He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch -- three-night performance -- like that other time . 
They had the cheek , them frauds ! 
I was right on him before I could shirk . 
He looked astonished , and says : Hel-_lo_ ! 
Where 'd _you_ come from ? 
Then he says , kind of glad and eager , Where 's the raft ? -- got her in a good place ? 
I says : Why , that 's just what I was going to ask your grace . 
Then he did n't look so joyful , and says : What was your idea for asking _me_ ? 
he says . 
Well , I says , when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself , we ca n't get him home for hours , till he 's soberer ; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait . 
A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep , and so I went along ; but when we was dragging him to the boat , and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along , he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run , and we after him . 
We did n't have no dog , and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out . 
We never got him till dark ; then we fetched him over , and I started down for the raft . 
When I got there and see it was gone , I says to myself , 'They 've got into trouble and had to leave ; and they 've took my nigger , which is the only nigger I 've got in the world , and now I 'm in a strange country , and ai n't got no property no more , nor nothing , and no way to make my living ; ' so I set down and cried . 
I slept in the woods all night . 
But what _did_ become of the raft , then ? -- and Jim -- poor Jim ! 
Blamed if I know -- that is , what 's become of the raft . 
That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars , and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he 'd spent for whisky ; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone , we said , 'That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us , and run off down the river . ' 
I would n't shake my _nigger_ , would I ? -- the only nigger I had in the world , and the only property . 
We never thought of that . 
Fact is , I reckon we 'd come to consider him _our_ nigger ; yes , we did consider him so -- goodness knows we had trouble enough for him . 
So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke , there war n't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake . 
And I 've pegged along ever since , dry as a powder-horn . 
Where's that ten cents ? 
Give it here . 
I had considerable money , so I give him ten cents , but begged him to spend it for something to eat , and give me some , because it was all the money I had , and I had n't had nothing to eat since yesterday . 
He never said nothing . 
The next minute he whirls on me and says : Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us ? 
We 'd skin him if he done that ! 
How can he blow ? 
Hai n't he run off ? 
No ! 
That old fool sold him , and never divided with me , and the money's gone . 
_Sold_ him ? 
I says , and begun to cry ; why , he was _my_ nigger , and that was my money . 
Where is he ? -- I want my nigger . 
Well , you ca n't _get_ your nigger , that 's all -- so dry up your blubbering . 
Looky here -- do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us ? 
Blamed if I think I 'd trust you . 
Why , if you _was_ to blow on us -- He stopped , but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before . 
I went on a-whimpering , and says : I do n't want to blow on nobody ; and I ai n't got no time to blow , nohow . 
I got to turn out and find my nigger . 
He looked kinder bothered , and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm , thinking , and wrinkling up his forehead . 
At last he says : I 'll tell you something . 
We got to be here three days . 
If you'll promise you wo n't blow , and wo n't let the nigger blow , I 'll tell you where to find him . 
So I promised , and he says : A farmer by the name of Silas Ph -- and then he stopped . 
You see , he started to tell me the truth ; but when he stopped that way , and begun to study and think again , I reckoned he was changing his mind . 
And so he was . 
He would n't trust me ; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days . 
So pretty soon he says : The man that bought him is named Abram Foster -- Abram G. Foster -- and he lives forty mile back here in the country , on the road to Lafayette . 
All right , I says , I can walk it in three days . 
And I 'll start this very afternoon . 
No you wont , you 'll start _now_ ; and do n't you lose any time about it , neither , nor do any gabbling by the way . 
Just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along , and then you wo n't get into trouble with _us_ , d 'ye hear ? 
That was the order I wanted , and that was the one I played for . 
I wanted to be left free to work my plans . 
So clear out , he says ; and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to . 
Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger -- some idiots do n't require documents -- leastways I 've heard there 's such down South here . 
And when you tell him the handbill and the reward 's bogus , maybe he 'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting 'em out . 
Go 'long now , and tell him anything you want to ; but mind you do n't work your jaw any _between_ here and there . 
So I left , and struck for the back country . 
I did n't look around , but I kinder felt like he was watching me . 
But I knowed I could tire him out at that . 
I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before I stopped ; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps ' . 
I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around , because I wanted to stop Jim 's mouth till these fellows could get away . 
I did n't want no trouble with their kind . 
I 'd seen all I wanted to of them , and wanted to get entirely shut of them . 
. 
WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like , and hot and sunshiny ; the hands was gone to the fields ; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody 's dead and gone ; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful , because you feel like it's spirits whispering -- spirits that 's been dead ever so many years -- and you always think they 're talking about _you_ . 
As a general thing it makes a body wish _he_ was dead , too , and done with it all . 
Phelps ' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations , and they all look alike . 
A rail fence round a two-acre yard ; a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps , like barrels of a different length , to climb over the fence with , and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse ; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard , but mostly it was bare and smooth , like an old hat with the nap rubbed off ; big double log-house for the white folks -- hewed logs , with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar , and these mud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another ; round-log kitchen , with a big broad , open but roofed passage joining it to the house ; log smoke-house back of the kitchen ; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t'other side the smoke-house ; one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence , and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut ; bench by the kitchen door , with bucket of water and a gourd ; hound asleep there in the sun ; more hounds asleep round about ; about three shade trees away off in a corner ; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence ; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch ; then the cotton fields begins , and after the fields the woods . 
I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper , and started for the kitchen . 
When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again ; and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead -- for that _is_ the lonesomest sound in the whole world . 
I went right along , not fixing up any particular plan , but just trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come ; for I 'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if I left it alone . 
When I got half-way , first one hound and then another got up and went for me , and of course I stopped and faced them , and kept still . 
And such another powwow as they made ! 
In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel , as you may say -- spokes made out of dogs -- circle of fifteen of them packed together around me , with their necks and noses stretched up towards me , a-barking and howling ; and more a-coming ; you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres . 
A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her hand , singing out , Begone _you_ Tige ! 
you Spot ! 
begone sah ! 
and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling , and then the rest followed ; and the next second half of them come back , wagging their tails around me , and making friends with me . 
There ain't no harm in a hound , nohow . 
And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts , and they hung on to their mother 's gown , and peeped out from behind her at me , bashful , the way they always do . 
And here comes the white woman running from the house , about forty-five or fifty year old , bareheaded , and her spinning-stick in her hand ; and behind her comes her little white children , acting the same way the little niggers was doing . 
She was smiling all over so she could hardly stand -- and says : It 's _you_ , at last ! -- _ain't_ it ? 
I out with a Yes 'm before I thought . 
She grabbed me and hugged me tight ; and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook ; and the tears come in her eyes , and run down over ; and she could n't seem to hug and shake enough , and kept saying , You do n't look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would ; but law sakes , I do n't care for that , I 'm so glad to see you ! 
Dear , dear , it does seem like I could eat you up ! 
Children , it 's your cousin Tom ! -- tell him howdy . 
But they ducked their heads , and put their fingers in their mouths , and hid behind her . 
So she run on : Lize , hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away -- or did you get your breakfast on the boat ? 
I said I had got it on the boat . 
So then she started for the house , leading me by the hand , and the children tagging after . 
When we got there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair , and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me , holding both of my hands , and says : Now I can have a _good_ look at you ; and , laws-a-me , I 've been hungry for it a many and a many a time , all these long years , and it 's come at last ! 
We been expecting you a couple of days and more . 
What kep' you ? -- boat get aground ? 
Yes 'm -- she -- Do n't say yes 'm -- say Aunt Sally . 
Where 'd she get aground ? 
I did n't rightly know what to say , because I did n't know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down . 
But I go a good deal on instinct ; and my instinct said she would be coming up -- from down towards Orleans . 
That did n't help me much , though ; for I did n't know the names of bars down that way . 
I see I 'd got to invent a bar , or forget the name of the one we got aground on -- or -- Now I struck an idea , and fetched it out : It war n't the grounding -- that did n't keep us back but a little . 
We blowed out a cylinder-head . 
Good gracious ! 
anybody hurt ? 
No 'm . 
Killed a nigger . 
Well , it 's lucky ; because sometimes people do get hurt . 
Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook , and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man . 
And I think he died afterwards . 
He was a Baptist . 
Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well . 
Yes , I remember now , he _did_ die . 
Mortification set in , and they had to amputate him . 
But it did n't save him . 
Yes , it was mortification -- that was it . 
He turned blue all over , and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection . 
They say he was a sight to look at . 
Your uncle 's been up to the town every day to fetch you . 
And he 's gone again , not more ' n an hour ago ; he 'll be back any minute now . 
You must a met him on the road , did n't you ? -- oldish man , with a -- No , I did n't see nobody , Aunt Sally . 
The boat landed just at daylight , and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country , to put in the time and not get here too soon ; and so I come down the back way . 
Who 'd you give the baggage to ? 
Nobody . 
Why , child , it 'll be stole ! 
Not where I hid it I reckon it wo n't , I says . 
How 'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat ? 
It was kinder thin ice , but I says : The captain see me standing around , and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore ; so he took me in the texas to the officers' lunch , and give me all I wanted . 
I was getting so uneasy I could n't listen good . 
I had my mind on the children all the time ; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little , and find out who I was . 
But I could n't get no show , Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so . 
Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back , because she says : But here we 're a-running on this way , and you hai n't told me a word about Sis , nor any of them . 
Now I 'll rest my works a little , and you start up yourn ; just tell me _everything_ -- tell me all about 'm all every one of 'm ; and how they are , and what they 're doing , and what they told you to tell me ; and every last thing you can think of . 
Well , I see I was up a stump -- and up it good . 
Providence had stood by me this fur all right , but I was hard and tight aground now . 
I see it war n't a bit of use to try to go ahead -- I 'd got to throw up my hand . 
So I says to myself , here 's another place where I got to resk the truth . 
I opened my mouth to begin ; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed , and says : Here he comes ! 
Stick your head down lower -- there , that 'll do ; you can't be seen now . 
Do n't you let on you 're here . 
I 'll play a joke on him . 
Children , do n't you say a word . 
I see I was in a fix now . 
But it war n't no use to worry ; there warn't nothing to do but just hold still , and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck . 
I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in ; then the bed hid him . 
Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him , and says : Has he come ? 
No , says her husband . 
Good-_ness_ gracious ! 
she says , what in the warld can have become of him ? 
I ca n't imagine , says the old gentleman ; and I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy . 
Uneasy ! 
she says ; I 'm ready to go distracted ! 
He _must_ a come ; and you 've missed him along the road . 
I _know_ it 's so -- something tells me so . 
Why , Sally , I _couldn't_ miss him along the road -- _you_ know that . 
But oh , dear , dear , what _will_ Sis say ! 
He must a come ! 
You must a missed him . 
He -- Oh , do n't distress me any more ' n I 'm already distressed . 
I do n't know what in the world to make of it . 
I 'm at my wit 's end , and I do n't mind acknowledging 't I 'm right down scared . 
But there 's no hope that he's come ; for he _couldn't_ come and me miss him . 
Sally , it 's terrible -- just terrible -- something 's happened to the boat , sure ! 
Why , Silas ! 
Look yonder ! -- up the road ! -- ai n't that somebody coming ? 
He sprung to the window at the head of the bed , and that give Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted . 
She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull , and out I come ; and when he turned back from the window there she stood , a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire , and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside . 
The old gentleman stared , and says : Why , who 's that ? 
Who do you reckon 't is ? 
I hai n't no idea . 
Who _is_ it ? 
It 's _Tom Sawyer ! _ By jings , I most slumped through the floor ! 
But there war n't no time to swap knives ; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook , and kept on shaking ; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry ; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid , and Mary , and the rest of the tribe . 
But if they was joyful , it war n't nothing to what I was ; for it was like being born again , I was so glad to find out who I was . 
Well , they froze to me for two hours ; and at last , when my chin was so tired it couldn't hardly go any more , I had told them more about my family -- I mean the Sawyer family -- than ever happened to any six Sawyer families . 
And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White River , and it took us three days to fix it . 
Which was all right , and worked first-rate ; because _they_ did n't know but what it would take three days to fix it . 
If I 'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well . 
Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side , and pretty uncomfortable all up the other . 
Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable , and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river . 
Then I says to myself , s'pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat ? 
And s'pose he steps in here any minute , and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet ? 
Well , I could n't _have_ it that way ; it would n't do at all . 
I must go up the road and waylay him . 
So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage . 
The old gentleman was for going along with me , but I said no , I could drive the horse myself , and I druther he would n't take no trouble about me . 
. 
SO I started for town in the wagon , and when I was half-way I see a wagon coming , and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer , and I stopped and waited till he come along . 
I says Hold on ! 
and it stopped alongside , and his mouth opened up like a trunk , and stayed so ; and he swallowed two or three times like a person that 's got a dry throat , and then says : I hai n't ever done you no harm . 
You know that . 
So , then , what you want to come back and ha'nt _me_ for ? 
I says : I hai n't come back -- I hai n't been _gone_ . 
When he heard my voice it righted him up some , but he war n't quite satisfied yet . 
He says : Do n't you play nothing on me , because I would n't on you . 
Honest injun now , you ai n't a ghost ? 
Honest injun , I ai n't , I says . 
Well -- I -- I -- well , that ought to settle it , of course ; but I ca n't somehow seem to understand it no way . 
Looky here , war n't you ever murdered _at all ? _ No . 
I war n't ever murdered at all -- I played it on them . 
You come in here and feel of me if you do n't believe me . 
So he done it ; and it satisfied him ; and he was that glad to see me again he did n't know what to do . 
And he wanted to know all about it right off , because it was a grand adventure , and mysterious , and so it hit him where he lived . 
But I said , leave it alone till by and by ; and told his driver to wait , and we drove off a little piece , and I told him the kind of a fix I was in , and what did he reckon we better do ? 
He said , let him alone a minute , and do n't disturb him . 
So he thought and thought , and pretty soon he says : It 's all right ; I 've got it . 
Take my trunk in your wagon , and let on it 's your ' n ; and you turn back and fool along slow , so as to get to the house about the time you ought to ; and I 'll go towards town a piece , and take a fresh start , and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you ; and you need n't let on to know me at first . 
I says : All right ; but wait a minute . 
There 's one more thing -- a thing that _nobody_ do n't know but me . 
And that is , there 's a nigger here that I 'm a-trying to steal out of slavery , and his name is _Jim_ -- old Miss Watson 's Jim . 
He says : What ! 
Why , Jim is -- He stopped and went to studying . 
I says : I know what you 'll say . 
You 'll say it 's dirty , low-down business ; but what if it is ? 
I 'm low down ; and I 'm a-going to steal him , and I want you keep mum and not let on . 
Will you ? 
His eye lit up , and he says : I 'll _help_ you steal him ! 
Well , I let go all holts then , like I was shot . 
It was the most astonishing speech I ever heard -- and I 'm bound to say Tom Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation . 
Only I could n't believe it . 
Tom Sawyer a _nigger-stealer ! _ Oh , shucks ! 
I says ; you 're joking . 
I ai n't joking , either . 
Well , then , I says , joking or no joking , if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger , do n't forget to remember that _you_ do n't know nothing about him , and I do n't know nothing about him . 
Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon , and he drove off his way and I drove mine . 
But of course I forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking ; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip . 
The old gentleman was at the door , and he says : Why , this is wonderful ! 
Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it ? 
I wish we 'd a timed her . 
And she hai n't sweated a hair -- not a hair . 
It 's wonderful . 
Why , I would n't take a hundred dollars for that horse now -- I would n't , honest ; and yet I 'd a sold her for fifteen before , and thought 't was all she was worth . 
That 's all he said . 
He was the innocentest , best old soul I ever see . 
But it war n't surprising ; because he war n't only just a farmer , he was a preacher , too , and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation , which he built it himself at his own expense , for a church and schoolhouse , and never charged nothing for his preaching , and it was worth it , too . 
There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that , and done the same way , down South . 
In about half an hour Tom 's wagon drove up to the front stile , and Aunt Sally she see it through the window , because it was only about fifty yards , and says : Why , there 's somebody come ! 
I wonder who 't is ? 
Why , I do believe it's a stranger . 
Jimmy ( that 's one of the children ) run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner . 
Everybody made a rush for the front door , because , of course , a stranger do n't come _every_ year , and so he lays over the yaller-fever , for interest , when he does come . 
Tom was over the stile and starting for the house ; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village , and we was all bunched in the front door . 
Tom had his store clothes on , and an audience -- and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer . 
In them circumstances it war n't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable . 
He war n't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep ; no , he come ca 'm and important , like the ram . 
When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty , like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he did n't want to disturb them , and says : Mr. Archibald Nichols , I presume ? 
No , my boy , says the old gentleman , I 'm sorry to say 't your driver has deceived you ; Nichols 's place is down a matter of three mile more . 
Come in , come in . 
Tom he took a look back over his shoulder , and says , Too late -- he 's out of sight . 
Yes , he 's gone , my son , and you must come in and eat your dinner with us ; and then we 'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols 's . 
Oh , I _can't_ make you so much trouble ; I could n't think of it . 
I'll walk -- I do n't mind the distance . 
But we wo n't _let_ you walk -- it would n't be Southern hospitality to do it . 
Come right in . 
Oh , _do_ , says Aunt Sally ; it ai n't a bit of trouble to us , not a bit in the world . 
You must stay . 
It 's a long , dusty three mile , and we ca n't let you walk . 
And , besides , I 've already told 'em to put on another plate when I see you coming ; so you must n't disappoint us . 
Come right in and make yourself at home . 
So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome , and let himself be persuaded , and come in ; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from Hicksville , Ohio , and his name was William Thompson -- and he made another bow . 
Well , he run on , and on , and on , making up stuff about Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent , and I getting a little nervious , and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape ; and at last , still talking along , he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth , and then settled back again in his chair comfortable , and was going on talking ; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand , and says : You owdacious puppy ! 
He looked kind of hurt , and says : I 'm surprised at you , m'am . 
You 're s'rp -- Why , what do you reckon I am ? 
I 've a good notion to take and -- Say , what do you mean by kissing me ? 
He looked kind of humble , and says : I did n't mean nothing , m'am . 
I did n't mean no harm . 
I -- I -- thought you'd like it . 
Why , you born fool ! 
She took up the spinning stick , and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it . 
What made you think I 'd like it ? 
Well , I do n't know . 
Only , they -- they -- told me you would . 
_They_ told you I would . 
Whoever told you 's _another_ lunatic . 
I never heard the beat of it . 
Who 's _they_ ? 
Why , everybody . 
They all said so , m'am . 
It was all she could do to hold in ; and her eyes snapped , and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him ; and she says : Who 's 'everybody ' ? 
Out with their names , or ther 'll be an idiot short . 
He got up and looked distressed , and fumbled his hat , and says : I 'm sorry , and I war n't expecting it . 
They told me to . 
They all told me to . 
They all said , kiss her ; and said she 'd like it . 
They all said it -- every one of them . 
But I 'm sorry , m'am , and I wo n't do it no more -- I wo n't , honest . 
You wo n't , wo n't you ? 
Well , I sh 'd _reckon_ you wo n't ! 
No 'm , I 'm honest about it ; I wo n't ever do it again -- till you ask me . 
Till I _ask_ you ! 
Well , I never see the beat of it in my born days ! 
I lay you 'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask you -- or the likes of you . 
Well , he says , it does surprise me so . 
I ca n't make it out , somehow . 
They said you would , and I thought you would . 
But -- He stopped and looked around slow , like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres , and fetched up on the old gentleman 's , and says , Didn't _you_ think she 'd like me to kiss her , sir ? 
Why , no ; I -- I -- well , no , I b'lieve I did n't . 
Then he looks on around the same way to me , and says : Tom , did n't _you_ think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and say , 'Sid Sawyer -- ' My land ! 
she says , breaking in and jumping for him , you impudent young rascal , to fool a body so -- and was going to hug him , but he fended her off , and says : No , not till you 've asked me first . 
So she did n't lose no time , but asked him ; and hugged him and kissed him over and over again , and then turned him over to the old man , and he took what was left . 
And after they got a little quiet again she says : Why , dear me , I never see such a surprise . 
We war n't looking for _you_ at all , but only Tom . 
Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him . 
It 's because it war n't _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom , he says ; but I begged and begged , and at the last minute she let me come , too ; so , coming down the river , me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first , and for me to by and by tag along and drop in , and let on to be a stranger . 
But it was a mistake , Aunt Sally . 
This ai n't no healthy place for a stranger to come . 
No -- not impudent whelps , Sid . 
You ought to had your jaws boxed ; I hai n't been so put out since I do n't know when . 
But I do n't care , I do n't mind the terms -- I 'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here . 
Well , to think of that performance ! 
I do n't deny it , I was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack . 
We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen ; and there was things enough on that table for seven families -- and all hot , too ; none of your flabby , tough meat that 's laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning . 
Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it , but it was worth it ; and it did n't cool it a bit , neither , the way I 've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times . 
There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon , and me and Tom was on the lookout all the time ; but it war n't no use , they did n't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger , and we was afraid to try to work up to it . 
But at supper , at night , one of the little boys says : Pa , may n't Tom and Sid and me go to the show ? 
No , says the old man , I reckon there ai n't going to be any ; and you could n't go if there was ; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me all about that scandalous show , and Burton said he would tell the people ; so I reckon they 've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time . 
So there it was ! -- but I could n't help it . 
Tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed ; so , being tired , we bid good-night and went up to bed right after supper , and clumb out of the window and down the lightning-rod , and shoved for the town ; for I did n't believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint , and so if I did n't hurry up and give them one they 'd get into trouble sure . 
On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered , and how pap disappeared pretty soon , and did n't come back no more , and what a stir there was when Jim run away ; and I told Tom all about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions , and as much of the raft voyage as I had time to ; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it -- it was as much as half-after eight , then -- here comes a raging rush of people with torches , and an awful whooping and yelling , and banging tin pans and blowing horns ; and we jumped to one side to let them go by ; and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail -- that is , I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke , though they was all over tar and feathers , and did n't look like nothing in the world that was human -- just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes . 
Well , it made me sick to see it ; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals , it seemed like I could n't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world . 
It was a dreadful thing to see . 
Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another . 
We see we was too late -- could n't do no good . 
We asked some stragglers about it , and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent ; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage ; then somebody give a signal , and the house rose up and went for them . 
So we poked along back home , and I war n't feeling so brash as I was before , but kind of ornery , and humble , and to blame , somehow -- though I had n't done nothing . 
But that 's always the way ; it do n't make no difference whether you do right or wrong , a person 's conscience ain't got no sense , and just goes for him anyway . 
If I had a yaller dog that did n't know no more than a person 's conscience does I would pison him . 
It takes up more room than all the rest of a person 's insides , and yet ai n't no good , nohow . 
Tom Sawyer he says the same . 
. 
WE stopped talking , and got to thinking . 
By and by Tom says : Looky here , Huck , what fools we are to not think of it before ! 
I bet I know where Jim is . 
No ! 
Where ? 
In that hut down by the ash-hopper . 
Why , looky here . 
When we was at dinner , did n't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles ? 
Yes . 
What did you think the vittles was for ? 
For a dog . 
So 'd I . 
Well , it was n't for a dog . 
Why ? 
Because part of it was watermelon . 
So it was -- I noticed it . 
Well , it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon . 
It shows how a body can see and do n't see at the same time . 
Well , the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in , and he locked it again when he came out . 
He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table -- same key , I bet . 
Watermelon shows man , lock shows prisoner ; and it ai n't likely there 's two prisoners on such a little plantation , and where the people 's all so kind and good . 
Jim 's the prisoner . 
All right -- I 'm glad we found it out detective fashion ; I would n't give shucks for any other way . 
Now you work your mind , and study out a plan to steal Jim , and I will study out one , too ; and we 'll take the one we like the best . 
What a head for just a boy to have ! 
If I had Tom Sawyer 's head I would n't trade it off to be a duke , nor mate of a steamboat , nor clown in a circus , nor nothing I can think of . 
I went to thinking out a plan , but only just to be doing something ; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from . 
Pretty soon Tom says : Ready ? 
Yes , I says . 
All right -- bring it out . 
My plan is this , I says . 
We can easy find out if it 's Jim in there . 
Then get up my canoe to-morrow night , and fetch my raft over from the island . 
Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man 's britches after he goes to bed , and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim , hiding daytimes and running nights , the way me and Jim used to do before . 
Would n't that plan work ? 
_Work_ ? 
Why , cert'nly it would work , like rats a-fighting . 
But it's too blame ' simple ; there ai n't nothing _to_ it . 
What 's the good of a plan that ai n't no more trouble than that ? 
It 's as mild as goose-milk . 
Why , Huck , it would n't make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory . 
I never said nothing , because I war n't expecting nothing different ; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn't have none of them objections to it . 
And it did n't . 
He told me what it was , and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style , and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would , and maybe get us all killed besides . 
So I was satisfied , and said we would waltz in on it . 
I need n't tell what it was here , because I knowed it would n't stay the way , it was . 
I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along , and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance . 
And that is what he done . 
Well , one thing was dead sure , and that was that Tom Sawyer was in earnest , and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery . 
That was the thing that was too many for me . 
Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up ; and had a character to lose ; and folks at home that had characters ; and he was bright and not leather-headed ; and knowing and not ignorant ; and not mean , but kind ; and yet here he was , without any more pride , or rightness , or feeling , than to stoop to this business , and make himself a shame , and his family a shame , before everybody . 
I _couldn't_ understand it no way at all . 
It was outrageous , and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so ; and so be his true friend , and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself . 
And I _did_ start to tell him ; but he shut me up , and says : Do n't you reckon I know what I 'm about ? 
Do n't I generly know what I'm about ? 
Yes . 
Did n't I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger ? 
Yes . 
_Well_ , then . 
That 's all he said , and that 's all I said . 
It war n't no use to say any more ; because when he said he 'd do a thing , he always done it . 
But I could n't make out how he was willing to go into this thing ; so I just let it go , and never bothered no more about it . 
If he was bound to have it so , I could n't help it . 
When we got home the house was all dark and still ; so we went on down to the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it . 
We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do . 
They knowed us , and did n't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night . 
When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides ; and on the side I war n't acquainted with -- which was the north side -- we found a square window-hole , up tolerable high , with just one stout board nailed across it . 
I says : Here 's the ticket . 
This hole 's big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board . 
Tom says : It 's as simple as tit-tat-toe , three-in-a-row , and as easy as playing hooky . 
I should _hope_ we can find a way that 's a little more complicated than _that_ , Huck Finn . 
Well , then , I says , how 'll it do to saw him out , the way I done before I was murdered that time ? 
That 's more _like_ , he says . 
It 's real mysterious , and troublesome , and good , he says ; but I bet we can find a way that 's twice as long . 
There ai n't no hurry ; le 's keep on looking around . 
Betwixt the hut and the fence , on the back side , was a lean-to that joined the hut at the eaves , and was made out of plank . 
It was as long as the hut , but narrow -- only about six foot wide . 
The door to it was at the south end , and was padlocked . 
Tom he went to the soap-kettle and searched around , and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with ; so he took it and prized out one of the staples . 
The chain fell down , and we opened the door and went in , and shut it , and struck a match , and see the shed was only built against a cabin and had n't no connection with it ; and there war n't no floor to the shed , nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow . 
The match went out , and so did we , and shoved in the staple again , and the door was locked as good as ever . 
Tom was joyful . 
He says ; Now we 're all right . 
We 'll _dig_ him out . 
It 'll take about a week ! 
Then we started for the house , and I went in the back door -- you only have to pull a buckskin latch-string , they do n't fasten the doors -- but that war n't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer ; no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning-rod . 
But after he got up half way about three times , and missed fire and fell every time , and the last time most busted his brains out , he thought he 'd got to give it up ; but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck , and this time he made the trip . 
In the morning we was up at break of day , and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim -- if it _was_ Jim that was being fed . 
The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields ; and Jim 's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things ; and whilst the others was leaving , the key come from the house . 
This nigger had a good-natured , chuckle-headed face , and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread . 
That was to keep witches off . 
He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights , and making him see all kinds of strange things , and hear all kinds of strange words and noises , and he did n't believe he was ever witched so long before in his life . 
He got so worked up , and got to running on so about his troubles , he forgot all about what he 'd been a-going to do . 
So Tom says : What 's the vittles for ? 
Going to feed the dogs ? 
The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face , like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle , and he says : Yes , Mars Sid , A dog . 
Cur'us dog , too . 
Does you want to go en look at 'im ? 
Yes . 
I hunched Tom , and whispers : You going , right here in the daybreak ? 
_that_ war n't the plan . 
No , it war n't ; but it 's the plan _now_ . 
So , drat him , we went along , but I did n't like it much . 
When we got in we could n't hardly see anything , it was so dark ; but Jim was there , sure enough , and could see us ; and he sings out : Why , _Huck_ ! 
En good _lan_ ' ! 
ain ' dat Misto Tom ? 
I just knowed how it would be ; I just expected it . 
I did n't know nothing to do ; and if I had I could n't a done it , because that nigger busted in and says : Why , de gracious sakes ! 
do he know you genlmen ? 
We could see pretty well now . 
Tom he looked at the nigger , steady and kind of wondering , and says : Does _who_ know us ? 
Why , dis-yer runaway nigger . 
I do n't reckon he does ; but what put that into your head ? 
What _put_ it dar ? 
Didn ' he jis ' dis minute sing out like he knowed you ? 
Tom says , in a puzzled-up kind of way : Well , that 's mighty curious . 
_Who_ sung out ? 
_when_ did he sing out ? 
_what_ did he sing out ? 
And turns to me , perfectly ca 'm , and says , Did _you_ hear anybody sing out ? 
Of course there war n't nothing to be said but the one thing ; so I says : No ; I ai n't heard nobody say nothing . 
Then he turns to Jim , and looks him over like he never see him before , and says : Did you sing out ? 
No , sah , says Jim ; I hai n't said nothing , sah . 
Not a word ? 
No , sah , I hai n't said a word . 
Did you ever see us before ? 
No , sah ; not as I knows on . 
So Tom turns to the nigger , which was looking wild and distressed , and says , kind of severe : What do you reckon 's the matter with you , anyway ? 
What made you think somebody sung out ? 
Oh , it 's de dad-blame ' witches , sah , en I wisht I was dead , I do . 
Dey 's awluz at it , sah , en dey do mos ' kill me , dey sk'yers me so . 
Please to do n't tell nobody 'bout it sah , er ole Mars Silas he 'll scole me ; 'kase he say dey _ain't_ no witches . 
I jis ' wish to goodness he was heah now -- _den_ what would he say ! 
I jis ' bet he couldn ' fine no way to git aroun ' it _dis_ time . 
But it 's awluz jis ' so ; people dat 's _sot_ , stays sot ; dey wo n't look into noth ' n'en fine it out f ' r deyselves , en when _you_ fine it out en tell um 'bout it , dey doan ' b'lieve you . 
Tom give him a dime , and said we would n't tell nobody ; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with ; and then looks at Jim , and says : I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger . 
If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away , I would n't give him up , I 'd hang him . 
And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good , he whispers to Jim and says : Do n't ever let on to know us . 
And if you hear any digging going on nights , it 's us ; we 're going to set you free . 
Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it ; then the nigger come back , and we said we 'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us to ; and he said he would , more particular if it was dark , because the witches went for him mostly in the dark , and it was good to have folks around then . 
. 
IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast , so we left and struck down into the woods ; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how to dig by , and a lantern makes too much , and might get us into trouble ; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that 's called fox-fire , and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place . 
We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds , and set down to rest , and Tom says , kind of dissatisfied : Blame it , this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be . 
And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan . 
There ai n't no watchman to be drugged -- now there _ought_ to be a watchman . 
There ai n't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to . 
And there 's Jim chained by one leg , with a ten-foot chain , to the leg of his bed : why , all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain . 
And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody ; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger , and do n't send nobody to watch the nigger . 
Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this , only there would n't be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg . 
Why , drat it , Huck , it 's the stupidest arrangement I ever see . 
You got to invent _all_ the difficulties . 
Well , we ca n't help it ; we got to do the best we can with the materials we 've got . 
Anyhow , there 's one thing -- there 's more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers , where there war n't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them , and you had to contrive them all out of your own head . 
Now look at just that one thing of the lantern . 
When you come down to the cold facts , we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern's resky . 
Why , we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to , I believe . 
Now , whilst I think of it , we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get . 
What do we want of a saw ? 
What do we _want_ of it ? 
Hai n't we got to saw the leg of Jim 's bed off , so as to get the chain loose ? 
Why , you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off . 
Well , if that ai n't just like you , Huck Finn . 
You _can_ get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing . 
Why , hai n't you ever read any books at all ? -- Baron Trenck , nor Casanova , nor Benvenuto Chelleeny , nor Henri IV. , nor none of them heroes ? 
Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that ? 
No ; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two , and leave it just so , and swallow the sawdust , so it ca n't be found , and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal ca n't see no sign of it 's being sawed , and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound . 
Then , the night you 're ready , fetch the leg a kick , down she goes ; slip off your chain , and there you are . 
Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements , shin down it , break your leg in the moat -- because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short , you know -- and there 's your horses and your trusty vassles , and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle , and away you go to your native Langudoc , or Navarre , or wherever it is . 
It 's gaudy , Huck . 
I wish there was a moat to this cabin . 
If we get time , the night of the escape , we 'll dig one . 
I says : What do we want of a moat when we 're going to snake him out from under the cabin ? 
But he never heard me . 
He had forgot me and everything else . 
He had his chin in his hand , thinking . 
Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head ; then sighs again , and says : No , it would n't do -- there ai n't necessity enough for it . 
For what ? 
I says . 
Why , to saw Jim 's leg off , he says . 
Good land ! 
I says ; why , there ai n't _no_ necessity for it . 
And what would you want to saw his leg off for , anyway ? 
Well , some of the best authorities has done it . 
They could n't get the chain off , so they just cut their hand off and shoved . 
And a leg would be better still . 
But we got to let that go . 
There ai n't necessity enough in this case ; and , besides , Jim 's a nigger , and wouldn't understand the reasons for it , and how it 's the custom in Europe ; so we 'll let it go . 
But there 's one thing -- he can have a rope ladder ; we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough . 
And we can send it to him in a pie ; it 's mostly done that way . 
And I 've et worse pies . 
Why , Tom Sawyer , how you talk , I says ; Jim ai n't got no use for a rope ladder . 
He _has_ got use for it . 
How _you_ talk , you better say ; you don't know nothing about it . 
He 's _got_ to have a rope ladder ; they all do . 
What in the nation can he _do_ with it ? 
_Do_ with it ? 
He can hide it in his bed , ca n't he ? 
That 's what they all do ; and _he's_ got to , too . 
Huck , you do n't ever seem to want to do anything that 's regular ; you want to be starting something fresh all the time . 
S'pose he _don't_ do nothing with it ? 
ai n't it there in his bed , for a clew , after he 's gone ? 
and do n't you reckon they 'll want clews ? 
Of course they will . 
And you would n't leave them any ? 
That would be a _pretty_ howdy-do , _wouldn't_ it ! 
I never heard of such a thing . 
Well , I says , if it 's in the regulations , and he 's got to have it , all right , let him have it ; because I do n't wish to go back on no regulations ; but there 's one thing , Tom Sawyer -- if we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder , we 're going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally , just as sure as you 're born . 
Now , the way I look at it , a hickry-bark ladder do n't cost nothing , and do n't waste nothing , and is just as good to load up a pie with , and hide in a straw tick , as any rag ladder you can start ; and as for Jim , he ai n't had no experience , and so he do n't care what kind of a -- Oh , shucks , Huck Finn , if I was as ignorant as you I 'd keep still -- that 's what I 'D do . 
Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder ? 
Why , it 's perfectly ridiculous . 
Well , all right , Tom , fix it your own way ; but if you 'll take my advice , you 'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline . 
He said that would do . 
And that gave him another idea , and he says : Borrow a shirt , too . 
What do we want of a shirt , Tom ? 
Want it for Jim to keep a journal on . 
Journal your granny -- _Jim_ ca n't write . 
S'pose he _can't_ write -- he can make marks on the shirt , ca n't he , if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel-hoop ? 
Why , Tom , we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one ; and quicker , too . 
_Prisoners_ do n't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens out of , you muggins . 
They _always_ make their pens out of the hardest , toughest , troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on ; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out , too , because they 've got to do it by rubbing it on the wall . 
_They_ would n't use a goose-quill if they had it . 
It ai n't regular . 
Well , then , what 'll we make him the ink out of ? 
Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears ; but that 's the common sort and women ; the best authorities uses their own blood . 
Jim can do that ; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he 's captivated , he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window . 
The Iron Mask always done that , and it 's a blame ' good way , too . 
Jim ai n't got no tin plates . 
They feed him in a pan . 
That ai n't nothing ; we can get him some . 
Ca n't nobody _read_ his plates . 
That ai n't got anything to _do_ with it , Huck Finn . 
All _he's_ got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out . 
You do n't _have_ to be able to read it . 
Why , half the time you ca n't read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate , or anywhere else . 
Well , then , what 's the sense in wasting the plates ? 
Why , blame it all , it ai n't the _prisoner's_ plates . 
But it 's _somebody's_ plates , ai n't it ? 
Well , spos ' n it is ? 
What does the _prisoner_ care whose -- He broke off there , because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing . 
So we cleared out for the house . 
Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line ; and I found an old sack and put them in it , and we went down and got the fox-fire , and put that in too . 
I called it borrowing , because that was what pap always called it ; but Tom said it warn't borrowing , it was stealing . 
He said we was representing prisoners ; and prisoners do n't care how they get a thing so they get it , and nobody do n't blame them for it , either . 
It ai n't no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with , Tom said ; it 's his right ; and so , as long as we was representing a prisoner , we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with . 
He said if we war n't prisoners it would be a very different thing , and nobody but a mean , ornery person would steal when he war n't a prisoner . 
So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy . 
And yet he made a mighty fuss , one day , after that , when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it ; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for . 
Tom said that what he meant was , we could steal anything we _needed_ . 
Well , I says , I needed the watermelon . 
But he said I didn't need it to get out of prison with ; there 's where the difference was . 
He said if I 'd a wanted it to hide a knife in , and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with , it would a been all right . 
So I let it go at that , though I could n't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon . 
Well , as I was saying , we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business , and nobody in sight around the yard ; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch . 
By and by he come out , and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk . 
He says : Everything 's all right now except tools ; and that 's easy fixed . 
Tools ? 
I says . 
Yes . 
Tools for what ? 
Why , to dig with . 
We ai n't a-going to _gnaw_ him out , are we ? 
Ai n't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with ? 
I says . 
He turns on me , looking pitying enough to make a body cry , and says : Huck Finn , did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels , and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with ? 
Now I want to ask you -- if you got any reasonableness in you at all -- what kind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero ? 
Why , they might as well lend him the key and done with it . 
Picks and shovels -- why , they would n't furnish 'em to a king . 
Well , then , I says , if we do n't want the picks and shovels , what do we want ? 
A couple of case-knives . 
To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with ? 
Yes . 
Confound it , it 's foolish , Tom . 
It do n't make no difference how foolish it is , it 's the _right_ way -- and it 's the regular way . 
And there ai n't no _other_ way , that ever I heard of , and I 've read all the books that gives any information about these things . 
They always dig out with a case-knife -- and not through dirt , mind you ; generly it 's through solid rock . 
And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks , and for ever and ever . 
Why , look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef , in the harbor of Marseilles , that dug himself out that way ; how long was _he_ at it , you reckon ? 
I do n't know . 
Well , guess . 
I do n't know . 
A month and a half . 
_Thirty-seven year_ -- and he come out in China . 
_That's_ the kind . 
I wish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock . 
_Jim_ do n't know nobody in China . 
What 's _that_ got to do with it ? 
Neither did that other fellow . 
But you 're always a-wandering off on a side issue . 
Why ca n't you stick to the main point ? 
All right -- I do n't care where he comes out , so he _comes_ out ; and Jim do n't , either , I reckon . 
But there 's one thing , anyway -- Jim 's too old to be dug out with a case-knife . 
He wo n't last . 
Yes he will _last_ , too . 
You do n't reckon it 's going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation , do you ? 
How long will it take , Tom ? 
Well , we ca n't resk being as long as we ought to , because it mayn't take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans . 
He 'll hear Jim ai n't from there . 
Then his next move will be to advertise Jim , or something like that . 
So we ca n't resk being as long digging him out as we ought to . 
By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years ; but we ca n't . 
Things being so uncertain , what I recommend is this : that we really dig right in , as quick as we can ; and after that , we can _let on_ , to ourselves , that we was at it thirty-seven years . 
Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there 's an alarm . 
Yes , I reckon that 'll be the best way . 
Now , there 's _sense_ in that , I says . 
Letting on do n't cost nothing ; letting on ai n't no trouble ; and if it 's any object , I do n't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year . 
It would n't strain me none , after I got my hand in . 
So I 'll mosey along now , and smouch a couple of case-knives . 
Smouch three , he says ; we want one to make a saw out of . 
Tom , if it ai n't unregular and irreligious to sejest it , I says , there 's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house . 
He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like , and says : It ai n't no use to try to learn you nothing , Huck . 
Run along and smouch the knives -- three of them . 
So I done it . 
. 
AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning-rod , and shut ourselves up in the lean-to , and got out our pile of fox-fire , and went to work . 
We cleared everything out of the way , about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log . 
Tom said he was right behind Jim 's bed now , and we 'd dig in under it , and when we got through there could n't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there , because Jim 's counter-pin hung down most to the ground , and you 'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole . 
So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight ; and then we was dog-tired , and our hands was blistered , and yet you could n't see we 'd done anything hardly . 
At last I says : This ai n't no thirty-seven year job ; this is a thirty-eight year job , Tom Sawyer . 
He never said nothing . 
But he sighed , and pretty soon he stopped digging , and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking . 
Then he says : It ai n't no use , Huck , it ai n't a-going to work . 
If we was prisoners it would , because then we 'd have as many years as we wanted , and no hurry ; and we would n't get but a few minutes to dig , every day , while they was changing watches , and so our hands would n't get blistered , and we could keep it up right along , year in and year out , and do it right , and the way it ought to be done . 
But _we_ ca n't fool along ; we got to rush ; we ai n't got no time to spare . 
If we was to put in another night this way we 'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well -- could n't touch a case-knife with them sooner . 
Well , then , what we going to do , Tom ? 
I 'll tell you . 
It ai n't right , and it ai n't moral , and I would n't like it to get out ; but there ai n't only just the one way : we got to dig him out with the picks , and _let on_ it 's case-knives . 
_Now_ you 're _talking_ ! 
I says ; your head gets leveler and leveler all the time , Tom Sawyer , I says . 
Picks is the thing , moral or no moral ; and as for me , I do n't care shucks for the morality of it , nohow . 
When I start in to steal a nigger , or a watermelon , or a Sunday-school book , I ai n't no ways particular how it 's done so it 's done . 
What I want is my nigger ; or what I want is my watermelon ; or what I want is my Sunday-school book ; and if a pick 's the handiest thing , that 's the thing I 'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with ; and I do n't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther . 
Well , he says , there 's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this ; if it war n't so , I would n't approve of it , nor I would n't stand by and see the rules broke -- because right is right , and wrong is wrong , and a body ai n't got no business doing wrong when he ai n't ignorant and knows better . 
It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick , _without_ any letting on , because you do n't know no better ; but it would n't for me , because I do know better . 
Gim me a case-knife . 
He had his own by him , but I handed him mine . 
He flung it down , and says : Gim me a _case-knife_ . 
I did n't know just what to do -- but then I thought . 
I scratched around amongst the old tools , and got a pickaxe and give it to him , and he took it and went to work , and never said a word . 
He was always just that particular . 
Full of principle . 
So then I got a shovel , and then we picked and shoveled , turn about , and made the fur fly . 
We stuck to it about a half an hour , which was as long as we could stand up ; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it . 
When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod , but he could n't come it , his hands was so sore . 
At last he says : It ai n't no use , it ca n't be done . 
What you reckon I better do ? 
Can't you think of no way ? 
Yes , I says , but I reckon it ai n't regular . 
Come up the stairs , and let on it 's a lightning-rod . 
So he done it . 
Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house , for to make some pens for Jim out of , and six tallow candles ; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance , and stole three tin plates . 
Tom says it was n't enough ; but I said nobody would n't ever see the plates that Jim throwed out , because they 'd fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole -- then we could tote them back and he could use them over again . 
So Tom was satisfied . 
Then he says : Now , the thing to study out is , how to get the things to Jim . 
Take them in through the hole , I says , when we get it done . 
He only just looked scornful , and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea , and then he went to studying . 
By and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways , but there war n't no need to decide on any of them yet . 
Said we 'd got to post Jim first . 
That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten , and took one of the candles along , and listened under the window-hole , and heard Jim snoring ; so we pitched it in , and it did n't wake him . 
Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel , and in about two hours and a half the job was done . 
We crept in under Jim 's bed and into the cabin , and pawed around and found the candle and lit it , and stood over Jim awhile , and found him looking hearty and healthy , and then we woke him up gentle and gradual . 
He was so glad to see us he most cried ; and called us honey , and all the pet names he could think of ; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away , and clearing out without losing any time . 
But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be , and set down and told him all about our plans , and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm ; and not to be the least afraid , because we would see he got away , _sure_ . 
So Jim he said it was all right , and we set there and talked over old times awhile , and then Tom asked a lot of questions , and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him , and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat , and both of them was kind as they could be , Tom says : _Now_ I know how to fix it . 
We 'll send you some things by them . 
I said , Do n't do nothing of the kind ; it 's one of the most jackass ideas I ever struck ; but he never paid no attention to me ; went right on . 
It was his way when he 'd got his plans set . 
So he told Jim how we 'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other large things by Nat , the nigger that fed him , and he must be on the lookout , and not be surprised , and not let Nat see him open them ; and we would put small things in uncle 's coat-pockets and he must steal them out ; and we would tie things to aunt 's apron-strings or put them in her apron-pocket , if we got a chance ; and told him what they would be and what they was for . 
And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood , and all that . 
He told him everything . 
Jim he could n't see no sense in the most of it , but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him ; so he was satisfied , and said he would do it all just as Tom said . 
Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco ; so we had a right down good sociable time ; then we crawled out through the hole , and so home to bed , with hands that looked like they 'd been chawed . 
Tom was in high spirits . 
He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life , and the most intellectural ; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out ; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it . 
He said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year , and would be the best time on record . 
And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it . 
In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes , and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket . 
Then we went to the nigger cabins , and while I got Nat's notice off , Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim 's pan , and we went along with Nat to see how it would work , and it just worked noble ; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out ; and there war n't ever anything could a worked better . 
Tom said so himself . 
Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that 's always getting into bread , you know ; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first . 
And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light , here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim 's bed ; and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them , and there war n't hardly room in there to get your breath . 
By jings , we forgot to fasten that lean-to door ! 
The nigger Nat he only just hollered Witches once , and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs , and begun to groan like he was dying . 
Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim 's meat , and the dogs went for it , and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door , and I knowed he 'd fixed the other door too . 
Then he went to work on the nigger , coaxing him and petting him , and asking him if he 'd been imagining he saw something again . 
He raised up , and blinked his eyes around , and says : Mars Sid , you 'll say I 's a fool , but if I did n't b'lieve I see most a million dogs , er devils , er some ' n , I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks . 
I did , mos ' sholy . 
Mars Sid , I _felt_ um -- I _felt_ um , sah ; dey was all over me . 
Dad fetch it , I jis ' wisht I could git my han 's on one er dem witches jis ' wunst -- on ' y jis ' wunst -- it 's all I 'd ast . 
But mos'ly I wisht dey 'd lem me 'lone , I does . 
Tom says : Well , I tell you what I think . 
What makes them come here just at this runaway nigger 's breakfast-time ? 
It 's because they 're hungry ; that's the reason . 
You make them a witch pie ; that 's the thing for _you_ to do . 
But my lan ' , Mars Sid , how 's I gwyne to make 'm a witch pie ? 
I doan' know how to make it . 
I hai n't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo ' . 
Well , then , I 'll have to make it myself . 
Will you do it , honey ? -- will you ? 
I 'll wusshup de groun ' und ' yo ' foot , I will ! 
All right , I 'll do it , seeing it 's you , and you 've been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger . 
But you got to be mighty careful . 
When we come around , you turn your back ; and then whatever we 've put in the pan , do n't you let on you see it at all . 
And do n't you look when Jim unloads the pan -- something might happen , I do n't know what . 
And above all , do n't you _handle_ the witch-things . 
_Hannel 'M_ , Mars Sid ? 
What _is_ you a-talkin ' 'bout ? 
I wouldn' lay de weight er my finger on um , not f ' r ten hund 'd thous ' n billion dollars , I would n't . 
. 
THAT was all fixed . 
So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile in the back yard , where they keep the old boots , and rags , and pieces of bottles , and wore-out tin things , and all such truck , and scratched around and found an old tin washpan , and stopped up the holes as well as we could , to bake the pie in , and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast , and found a couple of shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with , and dropped one of them in Aunt Sally 's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair , and t'other we stuck in the band of Uncle Silas 's hat , which was on the bureau , because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger's house this morning , and then went to breakfast , and Tom dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas 's coat-pocket , and Aunt Sally was n't come yet , so we had to wait a little while . 
And when she come she was hot and red and cross , and could n't hardly wait for the blessing ; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child 's head with her thimble with the other , and says : I 've hunted high and I 've hunted low , and it does beat all what _has_ become of your other shirt . 
My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things , and a hard piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough , and was shot across the table , and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm , and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop , and Tom he turned kinder blue around the gills , and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that , and I would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder . 
But after that we was all right again -- it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold . 
Uncle Silas he says : It 's most uncommon curious , I ca n't understand it . 
I know perfectly well I took it _off_ , because -- Because you hai n't got but one _on_ . 
Just _listen_ at the man ! 
I know you took it off , and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering memory , too , because it was on the clo's-line yesterday -- I see it there myself . 
But it 's gone , that 's the long and the short of it , and you'll just have to change to a red flann ' l one till I can get time to make a new one . 
And it 'll be the third I 've made in two years . 
It just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts ; and whatever you do manage to _do_ with 'm all is more ' n I can make out . 
A body 'd think you _would_ learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life . 
I know it , Sally , and I do try all I can . 
But it ought n't to be altogether my fault , because , you know , I do n't see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they 're on me ; and I do n't believe I 've ever lost one of them _off_ of me . 
Well , it ai n't _your_ fault if you have n't , Silas ; you 'd a done it if you could , I reckon . 
And the shirt ai n't all that 's gone , nuther . 
Ther 's a spoon gone ; and _that_ ai n't all . 
There was ten , and now ther 's only nine . 
The calf got the shirt , I reckon , but the calf never took the spoon , _that's_ certain . 
Why , what else is gone , Sally ? 
Ther 's six _candles_ gone -- that 's what . 
The rats could a got the candles , and I reckon they did ; I wonder they do n't walk off with the whole place , the way you 're always going to stop their holes and don't do it ; and if they war n't fools they 'd sleep in your hair , Silas -- _you'd_ never find it out ; but you ca n't lay the _spoon_ on the rats , and that I know . 
Well , Sally , I 'm in fault , and I acknowledge it ; I 've been remiss ; but I wo n't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes . 
Oh , I would n't hurry ; next year 'll do . 
Matilda Angelina Araminta _Phelps ! _ Whack comes the thimble , and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any . 
Just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage , and says : Missus , dey 's a sheet gone . 
A _sheet_ gone ! 
Well , for the land 's sake ! 
I 'll stop up them holes to-day , says Uncle Silas , looking sorrowful . 
Oh , _do_ shet up ! -- s'pose the rats took the _sheet_ ? 
_where's_ it gone , Lize ? 
Clah to goodness I hai n't no notion , Miss ' Sally . 
She wuz on de clo'sline yistiddy , but she done gone : she ain ' dah no mo ' now . 
I reckon the world _is_ coming to an end . 
I _never_ see the beat of it in all my born days . 
A shirt , and a sheet , and a spoon , and six can -- Missus , comes a young yaller wench , dey 's a brass cannelstick miss ' n . 
Cler out from here , you hussy , er I 'll take a skillet to ye ! 
Well , she was just a-biling . 
I begun to lay for a chance ; I reckoned I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated . 
She kept a-raging right along , running her insurrection all by herself , and everybody else mighty meek and quiet ; and at last Uncle Silas , looking kind of foolish , fishes up that spoon out of his pocket . 
She stopped , with her mouth open and her hands up ; and as for me , I wished I was in Jeruslem or somewheres . 
But not long , because she says : It 's _just_ as I expected . 
So you had it in your pocket all the time ; and like as not you 've got the other things there , too . 
How 'd it get there ? 
I reely do n't know , Sally , he says , kind of apologizing , or you know I would tell . 
I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before breakfast , and I reckon I put it in there , not noticing , meaning to put my Testament in , and it must be so , because my Testament ai n't in ; but I 'll go and see ; and if the Testament is where I had it , I 'll know I did n't put it in , and that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon , and -- Oh , for the land 's sake ! 
Give a body a rest ! 
Go 'long now , the whole kit and biling of ye ; and do n't come nigh me again till I 've got back my peace of mind . 
I 'D a heard her if she 'd a said it to herself , let alone speaking it out ; and I 'd a got up and obeyed her if I 'd a been dead . 
As we was passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat , and the shingle-nail fell out on the floor , and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf , and never said nothing , and went out . 
Tom see him do it , and remembered about the spoon , and says : Well , it ai n't no use to send things by _him_ no more , he ain't reliable . 
Then he says : But he done us a good turn with the spoon , anyway , without knowing it , and so we 'll go and do him one without _him_ knowing it -- stop up his rat-holes . 
There was a noble good lot of them down cellar , and it took us a whole hour , but we done the job tight and good and shipshape . 
Then we heard steps on the stairs , and blowed out our light and hid ; and here comes the old man , with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other , looking as absent-minded as year before last . 
He went a mooning around , first to one rat-hole and then another , till he 'd been to them all . 
Then he stood about five minutes , picking tallow-drip off of his candle and thinking . 
Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs , saying : Well , for the life of me I ca n't remember when I done it . 
I could show her now that I war n't to blame on account of the rats . 
But never mind -- let it go . 
I reckon it would n't do no good . 
And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs , and then we left . 
He was a mighty nice old man . 
And always is . 
Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon , but he said we 'd got to have it ; so he took a think . 
When he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do ; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming , and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side , and I slid one of them up my sleeve , and Tom says : Why , Aunt Sally , there ai n't but nine spoons _yet_ . 
She says : Go 'long to your play , and do n't bother me . 
I know better , I counted 'm myself . 
Well , I 've counted them twice , Aunty , and I ca n't make but nine . 
She looked out of all patience , but of course she come to count -- anybody would . 
I declare to gracious ther ' _ain't_ but nine ! 
she says . 
Why , what in the world -- plague _take_ the things , I 'll count 'm again . 
So I slipped back the one I had , and when she got done counting , she says : Hang the troublesome rubbage , ther 's _ten_ now ! 
and she looked huffy and bothered both . 
But Tom says : Why , Aunty , I do n't think there 's ten . 
You numskull , did n't you see me _count 'm ? _ I know , but -- Well , I 'll count 'm _again_ . 
So I smouched one , and they come out nine , same as the other time . 
Well , she _was_ in a tearing way -- just a-trembling all over , she was so mad . 
But she counted and counted till she got that addled she 'd start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes ; and so , three times they come out right , and three times they come out wrong . 
Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west ; and she said cle ' r out and let her have some peace , and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she 'd skin us . 
So we had the odd spoon , and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders , and Jim got it all right , along with her shingle nail , before noon . 
We was very well satisfied with this business , and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took , because he said _now_ she could n't ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life ; and would n't believe she 'd counted them right if she _did_ ; and said that after she 'd about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she 'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more . 
So we put the sheet back on the line that night , and stole one out of her closet ; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she did n't know how many sheets she had any more , and she did n't _care_ , and war n't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it , and would n't count them again not to save her life ; she druther die first . 
So we was all right now , as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles , by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting ; and as to the candlestick , it war n't no consequence , it would blow over by and by . 
But that pie was a job ; we had no end of trouble with that pie . 
We fixed it up away down in the woods , and cooked it there ; and we got it done at last , and very satisfactory , too ; but not all in one day ; and we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through , and we got burnt pretty much all over , in places , and eyes put out with the smoke ; because , you see , we did n't want nothing but a crust , and we could n't prop it up right , and she would always cave in . 
But of course we thought of the right way at last -- which was to cook the ladder , too , in the pie . 
So then we laid in with Jim the second night , and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together , and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with . 
We let on it took nine months to make it . 
And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods , but it would n't go into the pie . 
Being made of a whole sheet , that way , there was rope enough for forty pies if we 'd a wanted them , and plenty left over for soup , or sausage , or anything you choose . 
We could a had a whole dinner . 
But we did n't need it . 
All we needed was just enough for the pie , and so we throwed the rest away . 
We did n't cook none of the pies in the wash-pan -- afraid the solder would melt ; but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of , because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable , not on account of being any account , because they war n't , but on account of them being relicts , you know , and we snaked her out , private , and took her down there , but she failed on the first pies , because we did n't know how , but she come up smiling on the last one . 
We took and lined her with dough , and set her in the coals , and loaded her up with rag rope , and put on a dough roof , and shut down the lid , and put hot embers on top , and stood off five foot , with the long handle , cool and comfortable , and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at . 
But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along , for if that rope ladder would n't cramp him down to business I do n't know nothing what I'm talking about , and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time , too . 
Nat did n't look when we put the witch pie in Jim 's pan ; and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles ; and so Jim got everything all right , and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick , and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole . 
. 
MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job , and so was the saw ; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all . 
That 's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall . 
But he had to have it ; Tom said he 'd _got_ to ; there war n't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind , and his coat of arms . 
Look at Lady Jane Grey , he says ; look at Gilford Dudley ; look at old Northumberland ! 
Why , Huck , s'pose it _is_ considerble trouble ? -- what you going to do ? -- how you going to get around it ? 
Jim 's _got_ to do his inscription and coat of arms . 
They all do . 
Jim says : Why , Mars Tom , I hai n't got no coat o ' arm ; I hai n't got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt , en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat . 
Oh , you do n't understand , Jim ; a coat of arms is very different . 
Well , I says , Jim 's right , anyway , when he says he ai n't got no coat of arms , because he hai n't . 
I reckon I knowed that , Tom says , but you bet he 'll have one before he goes out of this -- because he 's going out _right_ , and there ain't going to be no flaws in his record . 
So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece , Jim a-making his ' n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon , Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms . 
By and by he said he'd struck so many good ones he did n't hardly know which to take , but there was one which he reckoned he 'd decide on . 
He says : On the scutcheon we 'll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base , a saltire _murrey_ in the fess , with a dog , couchant , for common charge , and under his foot a chain embattled , for slavery , with a chevron _vert_ in a chief engrailed , and three invected lines on a field _azure_ , with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented ; crest , a runaway nigger , _sable_ , with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister ; and a couple of gules for supporters , which is you and me ; motto , _Maggiore Fretta , Minore Otto._ Got it out of a book -- means the more haste the less speed . 
Geewhillikins , I says , but what does the rest of it mean ? 
We ai n't got no time to bother over that , he says ; we got to dig in like all git-out . 
Well , anyway , I says , what 's _some_ of it ? 
What 's a fess ? 
A fess -- a fess is -- _you_ do n't need to know what a fess is . 
I 'll show him how to make it when he gets to it . 
Shucks , Tom , I says , I think you might tell a person . 
What 's a bar sinister ? 
Oh , I do n't know . 
But he 's got to have it . 
All the nobility does . 
That was just his way . 
If it did n't suit him to explain a thing to you , he would n't do it . 
You might pump at him a week , it would n't make no difference . 
He 'd got all that coat of arms business fixed , so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work , which was to plan out a mournful inscription -- said Jim got to have one , like they all done . 
He made up a lot , and wrote them out on a paper , and read them off , so : 1 . 
Here a captive heart busted . 
2 . 
Here a poor prisoner , forsook by the world and friends , fretted his sorrowful life . 
3 . 
Here a lonely heart broke , and a worn spirit went to its rest , after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity . 
4 . 
Here , homeless and friendless , after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity , perished a noble stranger , natural son of Louis XIV . 
Tom 's voice trembled whilst he was reading them , and he most broke down . 
When he got done he could n't no way make up his mind which one for Jim to scrabble on to the wall , they was all so good ; but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on . 
Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail , and he did n't know how to make letters , besides ; but Tom said he would block them out for him , and then he would n't have nothing to do but just follow the lines . 
Then pretty soon he says : Come to think , the logs ai n't a-going to do ; they do n't have log walls in a dungeon : we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock . 
We 'll fetch a rock . 
Jim said the rock was worse than the logs ; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he would n't ever get out . 
But Tom said he would let me help him do it . 
Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens . 
It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow , and did n't give my hands no show to get well of the sores , and we did n't seem to make no headway , hardly ; so Tom says : I know how to fix it . 
We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions , and we can kill two birds with that same rock . 
There 's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill , and we 'll smouch it , and carve the things on it , and file out the pens and the saw on it , too . 
It war n't no slouch of an idea ; and it war n't no slouch of a grindstone nuther ; but we allowed we 'd tackle it . 
It war n't quite midnight yet , so we cleared out for the mill , leaving Jim at work . 
We smouched the grindstone , and set out to roll her home , but it was a most nation tough job . 
Sometimes , do what we could , we could n't keep her from falling over , and she come mighty near mashing us every time . 
Tom said she was going to get one of us , sure , before we got through . 
We got her half way ; and then we was plumb played out , and most drownded with sweat . 
We see it war n't no use ; we got to go and fetch Jim . 
So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg , and wrapt it round and round his neck , and we crawled out through our hole and down there , and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing ; and Tom superintended . 
He could out-superintend any boy I ever see . 
He knowed how to do everything . 
Our hole was pretty big , but it war n't big enough to get the grindstone through ; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough . 
Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail , and set Jim to work on them , with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer , and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him , and then he could go to bed , and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it . 
Then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed-leg , and was ready for bed ourselves . 
But Tom thought of something , and says : You got any spiders in here , Jim ? 
No , sah , thanks to goodness I hai n't , Mars Tom . 
All right , we 'll get you some . 
But bless you , honey , I doan ' _want_ none . 
I 's afeard un um . 
I jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun ' . 
Tom thought a minute or two , and says : It 's a good idea . 
And I reckon it 's been done . 
It _must_ a been done ; it stands to reason . 
Yes , it 's a prime good idea . 
Where could you keep it ? 
Keep what , Mars Tom ? 
Why , a rattlesnake . 
De goodness gracious alive , Mars Tom ! 
Why , if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah I 'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall , I would , wid my head . 
Why , Jim , you would n't be afraid of it after a little . 
You could tame it . 
_Tame_ it ! 
Yes -- easy enough . 
Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting , and they would n't _think_ of hurting a person that pets them . 
Any book will tell you that . 
You try -- that 's all I ask ; just try for two or three days . 
Why , you can get him so , in a little while , that he 'll love you ; and sleep with you ; and wo n't stay away from you a minute ; and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth . 
_Please_ , Mars Tom -- _doan_ ' talk so ! 
I ca n't _stan_ ' it ! 
He 'd _let_ me shove his head in my mouf -- fer a favor , hai n't it ? 
I lay he 'd wait a pow'ful long time 'fo ' I _ast_ him . 
En mo ' en dat , I doan ' _want_ him to sleep wid me . 
Jim , do n't act so foolish . 
A prisoner 's _got_ to have some kind of a dumb pet , and if a rattlesnake hai n't ever been tried , why , there 's more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life . 
Why , Mars Tom , I doan ' _want_ no sich glory . 
Snake take ' n bite Jim 's chin off , den _whah_ is de glory ? 
No , sah , I doan ' want no sich doin 's . 
Blame it , ca n't you _try_ ? 
I only _want_ you to try -- you need n't keep it up if it do n't work . 
But de trouble all _done_ ef de snake bite me while I 's a tryin ' him . 
Mars Tom , I 's willin ' to tackle mos ' anything 'at ai n't onreasonable , but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame , I's gwyne to _leave_ , dat 's _shore_ . 
Well , then , let it go , let it go , if you 're so bull-headed about it . 
We can get you some garter-snakes , and you can tie some buttons on their tails , and let on they 're rattlesnakes , and I reckon that 'll have to do . 
I k ' n stan ' _dem_ , Mars Tom , but blame ' ' f I couldn ' get along widout um , I tell you dat . 
I never knowed b'fo ' 't was so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner . 
Well , it _always_ is when it 's done right . 
You got any rats around here ? 
No , sah , I hai n't seed none . 
Well , we 'll get you some rats . 
Why , Mars Tom , I doan ' _want_ no rats . 
Dey 's de dadblamedest creturs to 'sturb a body , en rustle roun ' over 'im , en bite his feet , when he's tryin ' to sleep , I ever see . 
No , sah , gim me g'yarter-snakes , ' f I's got to have 'm , but doan ' gim me no rats ; I hain ' got no use f ' r um , skasely . 
But , Jim , you _got_ to have 'em -- they all do . 
So do n't make no more fuss about it . 
Prisoners ai n't ever without rats . 
There ai n't no instance of it . 
And they train them , and pet them , and learn them tricks , and they get to be as sociable as flies . 
But you got to play music to them . 
You got anything to play music on ? 
I ain ' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o ' paper , en a juice-harp ; but I reck ' n dey wouldn ' take no stock in a juice-harp . 
Yes they would _they_ do n't care what kind of music 't is . 
A jews-harp 's plenty good enough for a rat . 
All animals like music -- in a prison they dote on it . 
Specially , painful music ; and you ca n't get no other kind out of a jews-harp . 
It always interests them ; they come out to see what 's the matter with you . 
Yes , you 're all right ; you 're fixed very well . 
You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep , and early in the mornings , and play your jews-harp ; play 'The Last Link is Broken ' -- that 's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker ' n anything else ; and when you 've played about two minutes you 'll see all the rats , and the snakes , and spiders , and things begin to feel worried about you , and come . 
And they 'll just fairly swarm over you , and have a noble good time . 
Yes , _dey_ will , I reck ' n , Mars Tom , but what kine er time is _Jim_ havin ' ? 
Blest if I kin see de pint . 
But I 'll do it ef I got to . 
I reck ' n I better keep de animals satisfied , en not have no trouble in de house . 
Tom waited to think it over , and see if there was n't nothing else ; and pretty soon he says : Oh , there 's one thing I forgot . 
Could you raise a flower here , do you reckon ? 
I doan know but maybe I could , Mars Tom ; but it 's tolable dark in heah , en I ain ' got no use f ' r no flower , nohow , en she 'd be a pow'ful sight o ' trouble . 
Well , you try it , anyway . 
Some other prisoners has done it . 
One er dem big cat-tail-lookin ' mullen-stalks would grow in heah , Mars Tom , I reck ' n , but she would n't be wuth half de trouble she 'd coss . 
Do n't you believe it . 
We 'll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there , and raise it . 
And do n't call it mullen , call it Pitchiola -- that 's its right name when it 's in a prison . 
And you want to water it with your tears . 
Why , I got plenty spring water , Mars Tom . 
You do n't _want_ spring water ; you want to water it with your tears . 
It 's the way they always do . 
Why , Mars Tom , I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man 's a _start'n_ one wid tears . 
That ai n't the idea . 
You _got_ to do it with tears . 
She 'll die on my han 's , Mars Tom , she sholy will ; kase I doan ' skasely ever cry . 
So Tom was stumped . 
But he studied it over , and then said Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion . 
He promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one , private , in Jim's coffee-pot , in the morning . 
Jim said he would jis ' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee ; and found so much fault with it , and with the work and bother of raising the mullen , and jews-harping the rats , and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things , on top of all the other work he had to do on pens , and inscriptions , and journals , and things , which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook , that Tom most lost all patience with him ; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself , and yet he did n't know enough to appreciate them , and they was just about wasted on him . 
So Jim he was sorry , and said he wouldn't behave so no more , and then me and Tom shoved for bed . 
. 
IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and fetched it down , and unstopped the best rat-hole , and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones ; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally 's bed . 
But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there , and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out , and they did ; and Aunt Sally she come in , and when we got back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain , and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her . 
So she took and dusted us both with the hickry , and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen , drat that meddlesome cub , and they warn't the likeliest , nuther , because the first haul was the pick of the flock . 
I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was . 
We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders , and bugs , and frogs , and caterpillars , and one thing or another ; and we like to got a hornet's nest , but we did n't . 
The family was at home . 
We did n't give it right up , but stayed with them as long as we could ; because we allowed we'd tire them out or they 'd got to tire us out , and they done it . 
Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places , and was pretty near all right again , but could n't set down convenient . 
And so we went for the snakes , and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes , and put them in a bag , and put it in our room , and by that time it was supper-time , and a rattling good honest day 's work : and hungry ? -- oh , no , I reckon not ! 
And there war n't a blessed snake up there when we went back -- we didn't half tie the sack , and they worked out somehow , and left . 
But it didn't matter much , because they was still on the premises somewheres . 
So we judged we could get some of them again . 
No , there war n't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell . 
You 'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then ; and they generly landed in your plate , or down the back of your neck , and most of the time where you did n't want them . 
Well , they was handsome and striped , and there war n't no harm in a million of them ; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally ; she despised snakes , be the breed what they might , and she could n't stand them no way you could fix it ; and every time one of them flopped down on her , it did n't make no difference what she was doing , she would just lay that work down and light out . 
I never see such a woman . 
And you could hear her whoop to Jericho . 
You could n't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs . 
And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire . 
She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there had n't ever been no snakes created . 
Why , after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally war n't over it yet ; she warn't near over it ; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings . 
It was very curious . 
But Tom said all women was just so . 
He said they was made that way for some reason or other . 
We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way , and she allowed these lickings war n't nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them . 
I did n't mind the lickings , because they did n't amount to nothing ; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot . 
But we got them laid in , and all the other things ; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim 's was when they'd all swarm out for music and go for him . 
Jim did n't like the spiders , and the spiders did n't like Jim ; and so they 'd lay for him , and make it mighty warm for him . 
And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there war n't no room in bed for him , skasely ; and when there was , a body could n't sleep , it was so lively , and it was always lively , he said , because _they_ never all slept at one time , but took turn about , so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck , and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch , so he always had one gang under him , in his way , and t'other gang having a circus over him , and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over . 
He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner again , not for a salary . 
Well , by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape . 
The shirt was sent in early , in a pie , and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh ; the pens was made , the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone ; the bed-leg was sawed in two , and we had et up the sawdust , and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache . 
We reckoned we was all going to die , but did n't . 
It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see ; and Tom said the same . 
But as I was saying , we 'd got all the work done now , at last ; and we was all pretty much fagged out , too , but mainly Jim . 
The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger , but had n't got no answer , because there war n't no such plantation ; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers ; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers , and I see we had n't no time to lose . 
So Tom said , now for the nonnamous letters . 
What 's them ? 
I says . 
Warnings to the people that something is up . 
Sometimes it 's done one way , sometimes another . 
But there 's always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle . 
When Louis XVI . 
was going to light out of the Tooleries , a servant-girl done it . 
It 's a very good way , and so is the nonnamous letters . 
We 'll use them both . 
And it's usual for the prisoner 's mother to change clothes with him , and she stays in , and he slides out in her clothes . 
We 'll do that , too . 
But looky here , Tom , what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that something 's up ? 
Let them find it out for themselves -- it 's their lookout . 
Yes , I know ; but you ca n't depend on them . 
It 's the way they 've acted from the very start -- left us to do _everything_ . 
They 're so confiding and mullet-headed they do n't take notice of nothing at all . 
So if we do n't _give_ them notice there wo n't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us , and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat ; wo n't amount to nothing -- wo n't be nothing _to_ it . 
Well , as for me , Tom , that 's the way I 'd like . 
Shucks ! 
he says , and looked disgusted . 
So I says : But I ai n't going to make no complaint . 
Any way that suits you suits me . 
What you going to do about the servant-girl ? 
You 'll be her . 
You slide in , in the middle of the night , and hook that yaller girl 's frock . 
Why , Tom , that 'll make trouble next morning ; because , of course , she prob'bly hai n't got any but that one . 
I know ; but you do n't want it but fifteen minutes , to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door . 
All right , then , I 'll do it ; but I could carry it just as handy in my own togs . 
You would n't look like a servant-girl _then_ , would you ? 
No , but there wo n't be nobody to see what I look like , _anyway_ . 
That ai n't got nothing to do with it . 
The thing for us to do is just to do our _duty_ , and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or not . 
Hai n't you got no principle at all ? 
All right , I ai n't saying nothing ; I 'm the servant-girl . 
Who 's Jim's mother ? 
I 'm his mother . 
I 'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally . 
Well , then , you 'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves . 
Not much . 
I 'll stuff Jim 's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise , and Jim 'll take the nigger woman's gown off of me and wear it , and we 'll all evade together . 
When a prisoner of style escapes it 's called an evasion . 
It 's always called so when a king escapes , f'rinstance . 
And the same with a king 's son ; it do n't make no difference whether he 's a natural one or an unnatural one . 
So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter , and I smouched the yaller wench's frock that night , and put it on , and shoved it under the front door , the way Tom told me to . 
It said : Beware . 
Trouble is brewing . 
Keep a sharp lookout . 
_Unknown_ _Friend_ . 
Next night we stuck a picture , which Tom drawed in blood , of a skull and crossbones on the front door ; and next night another one of a coffin on the back door . 
I never see a family in such a sweat . 
They could n't a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air . 
If a door banged , Aunt Sally she jumped and said ouch ! 
if anything fell , she jumped and said ouch ! 
if you happened to touch her , when she war n't noticing , she done the same ; she could n't face noway and be satisfied , because she allowed there was something behind her every time -- so she was always a-whirling around sudden , and saying ouch , and before she 'd got two-thirds around she 'd whirl back again , and say it again ; and she was afraid to go to bed , but she das n't set up . 
So the thing was working very well , Tom said ; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory . 
He said it showed it was done right . 
So he said , now for the grand bulge ! 
So the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready , and was wondering what we better do with it , because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night . 
Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spy around ; and the nigger at the back door was asleep , and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back . 
This letter said : Do n't betray me , I wish to be your friend . 
There is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway nigger to-night , and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them . 
I am one of the gang , but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again , and will betray the helish design . 
They will sneak down from northards , along the fence , at midnight exact , with a false key , and go in the nigger 's cabin to get him . 
I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger ; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all ; then whilst they are getting his chains loose , you slip there and lock them in , and can kill them at your leasure . 
Do n't do anything but just the way I am telling you , if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo . 
I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing . 
_Unknown Friend._ . 
WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast , and took my canoe and went over the river a-fishing , with a lunch , and had a good time , and took a look at the raft and found her all right , and got home late to supper , and found them in such a sweat and worry they did n't know which end they was standing on , and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper , and would n't tell us what the trouble was , and never let on a word about the new letter , but did n't need to , because we knowed as much about it as anybody did , and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed , and got up about half-past eleven , and Tom put on Aunt Sally 's dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch , but says : Where 's the butter ? 
I laid out a hunk of it , I says , on a piece of a corn-pone . 
Well , you _left_ it laid out , then -- it ai n't here . 
We can get along without it , I says . 
We can get along _with_ it , too , he says ; just you slide down cellar and fetch it . 
And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along . 
I 'll go and stuff the straw into Jim 's clothes to represent his mother in disguise , and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as you get there . 
So out he went , and down cellar went I . 
The hunk of butter , big as a person 's fist , was where I had left it , so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on , and blowed out my light , and started up stairs very stealthy , and got up to the main floor all right , but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle , and I clapped the truck in my hat , and clapped my hat on my head , and the next second she see me ; and she says : You been down cellar ? 
Yes 'm . 
What you been doing down there ? 
Noth ' n . 
_Noth ' n ! _ No 'm . 
Well , then , what possessed you to go down there this time of night ? 
I do n't know 'm . 
You do n't _know_ ? 
Do n't answer me that way . 
Tom , I want to know what you been _doing_ down there . 
I hai n't been doing a single thing , Aunt Sally , I hope to gracious if I have . 
I reckoned she 'd let me go now , and as a generl thing she would ; but I s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that war n't yard-stick straight ; so she says , very decided : You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come . 
You been up to something you no business to , and I lay I 'll find out what it is before I 'M done with you . 
So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room . 
My , but there was a crowd there ! 
Fifteen farmers , and every one of them had a gun . 
I was most powerful sick , and slunk to a chair and set down . 
They was setting around , some of them talking a little , in a low voice , and all of them fidgety and uneasy , but trying to look like they war n't ; but I knowed they was , because they was always taking off their hats , and putting them on , and scratching their heads , and changing their seats , and fumbling with their buttons . 
I war n't easy myself , but I did n't take my hat off , all the same . 
I did wish Aunt Sally would come , and get done with me , and lick me , if she wanted to , and let me get away and tell Tom how we 'd overdone this thing , and what a thundering hornet's-nest we 'd got ourselves into , so we could stop fooling around straight off , and clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us . 
At last she come and begun to ask me questions , but I _couldn't_ answer them straight , I did n't know which end of me was up ; because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay for them desperadoes , and saying it war n't but a few minutes to midnight ; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal ; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions , and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared ; and the place getting hotter and hotter , and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears ; and pretty soon , when one of them says , I 'M for going and getting in the cabin _first_ and right _now_ , and catching them when they come , I most dropped ; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead , and Aunt Sally she see it , and turns white as a sheet , and says : For the land 's sake , what _is_ the matter with the child ? 
He 's got the brain-fever as shore as you 're born , and they 're oozing out ! 
And everybody runs to see , and she snatches off my hat , and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter , and she grabbed me , and hugged me , and says : Oh , what a turn you did give me ! 
and how glad and grateful I am it ai n't no worse ; for luck 's against us , and it never rains but it pours , and when I see that truck I thought we 'd lost you , for I knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be if -- Dear , dear , whyd'nt you _tell_ me that was what you 'd been down there for , I would n't a cared . 
Now cler out to bed , and do n't lem me see no more of you till morning ! 
I was up stairs in a second , and down the lightning-rod in another one , and shinning through the dark for the lean-to . 
I could n't hardly get my words out , I was so anxious ; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must jump for it now , and not a minute to lose -- the house full of men , yonder , with guns ! 
His eyes just blazed ; and he says : No ! -- is that so ? 
_ain't_ it bully ! 
Why , Huck , if it was to do over again , I bet I could fetch two hundred ! 
If we could put it off till -- Hurry ! 
_Hurry_ ! 
I says . 
Where 's Jim ? 
Right at your elbow ; if you reach out your arm you can touch him . 
He 's dressed , and everything 's ready . 
Now we 'll slide out and give the sheep-signal . 
But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door , and heard them begin to fumble with the pad-lock , and heard a man say : I _told_ you we 'd be too soon ; they have n't come -- the door is locked . 
Here , I 'll lock some of you into the cabin , and you lay for 'em in the dark and kill 'em when they come ; and the rest scatter around a piece , and listen if you can hear 'em coming . 
So in they come , but could n't see us in the dark , and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed . 
But we got under all right , and out through the hole , swift but soft -- Jim first , me next , and Tom last , which was according to Tom 's orders . 
Now we was in the lean-to , and heard trampings close by outside . 
So we crept to the door , and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack , but could n't make out nothing , it was so dark ; and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further , and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first , and him last . 
So he set his ear to the crack and listened , and listened , and listened , and the steps a-scraping around out there all the time ; and at last he nudged us , and we slid out , and stooped down , not breathing , and not making the least noise , and slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file , and got to it all right , and me and Jim over it ; but Tom 's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail , and then he hear the steps coming , so he had to pull loose , which snapped the splinter and made a noise ; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out : Who 's that ? 
Answer , or I 'll shoot ! 
But we did n't answer ; we just unfurled our heels and shoved . 
Then there was a rush , and a _Bang , Bang , Bang ! _ and the bullets fairly whizzed around us ! 
We heard them sing out : Here they are ! 
They 've broke for the river ! 
After 'em , boys , and turn loose the dogs ! 
So here they come , full tilt . 
We could hear them because they wore boots and yelled , but we did n't wear no boots and did n't yell . 
We was in the path to the mill ; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by , and then dropped in behind them . 
They 'd had all the dogs shut up , so they would n't scare off the robbers ; but by this time somebody had let them loose , and here they come , making powwow enough for a million ; but they was our dogs ; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up ; and when they see it warn't nobody but us , and no excitement to offer them , they only just said howdy , and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering ; and then we up-steam again , and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill , and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied , and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river , but did n't make no more noise than we was obleeged to . 
Then we struck out , easy and comfortable , for the island where my raft was ; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank , till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out . 
And when we stepped on to the raft I says : _Now_ , old Jim , you 're a free man again , and I bet you wo n't ever be a slave no more . 
En a mighty good job it wuz , too , Huck . 
It 'uz planned beautiful , en it 'uz done beautiful ; en dey ai n't _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat 's mo' mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz . 
We was all glad as we could be , but Tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg . 
When me and Jim heard that we did n't feel so brash as what we did before . 
It was hurting him considerable , and bleeding ; so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke 's shirts for to bandage him , but he says : Gim me the rags ; I can do it myself . 
Do n't stop now ; do n't fool around here , and the evasion booming along so handsome ; man the sweeps , and set her loose ! 
Boys , we done it elegant ! -- 'deed we did . 
I wish _we'd_ a had the handling of Louis XVI. , there would n't a been no 'Son of Saint Louis , ascend to heaven ! ' 
wrote down in _his_ biography ; no , sir , we'd a whooped him over the _border_ -- that 's what we 'd a done with _him_ -- and done it just as slick as nothing at all , too . 
Man the sweeps -- man the sweeps ! 
But me and Jim was consulting -- and thinking . 
And after we 'd thought a minute , I says : Say it , Jim . 
So he says : Well , den , dis is de way it look to me , Huck . 
Ef it wuz _him_ dat 'uz bein ' sot free , en one er de boys wuz to git shot , would he say , 'Go on en save me , nemmine 'bout a doctor f ' r to save dis one ? ' 
Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer ? 
Would he say dat ? 
You _bet_ he would n't ! 
_well_ , den , is _Jim_ gywne to say it ? 
No , sah -- I doan ' budge a step out ' n dis place 'dout a _doctor_ , not if it 's forty year ! 
I knowed he was white inside , and I reckoned he 'd say what he did say -- so it was all right now , and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor . 
He raised considerable row about it , but me and Jim stuck to it and would n't budge ; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself ; but we would n't let him . 
Then he give us a piece of his mind , but it did n't do no good . 
So when he sees me getting the canoe ready , he says : Well , then , if you 're bound to go , I 'll tell you the way to do when you get to the village . 
Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast , and make him swear to be silent as the grave , and put a purse full of gold in his hand , and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark , and then fetch him here in the canoe , in a roundabout way amongst the islands , and search him and take his chalk away from him , and do n't give it back to him till you get him back to the village , or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again . 
It 's the way they all do . 
So I said I would , and left , and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again . 
. 
THE doctor was an old man ; a very nice , kind-looking old man when I got him up . 
I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting yesterday afternoon , and camped on a piece of a raft we found , and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams , for it went off and shot him in the leg , and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it , nor let anybody know , because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks . 
Who is your folks ? 
he says . 
The Phelpses , down yonder . 
Oh , he says . 
And after a minute , he says : How 'd you say he got shot ? 
He had a dream , I says , and it shot him . 
Singular dream , he says . 
So he lit up his lantern , and got his saddle-bags , and we started . 
But when he sees the canoe he did n't like the look of her -- said she was big enough for one , but did n't look pretty safe for two . 
I says : Oh , you need n't be afeard , sir , she carried the three of us easy enough . 
What three ? 
Why , me and Sid , and -- and -- and _the guns_ ; that 's what I mean . 
Oh , he says . 
But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her , and shook his head , and said he reckoned he 'd look around for a bigger one . 
But they was all locked and chained ; so he took my canoe , and said for me to wait till he come back , or I could hunt around further , or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to . 
But I said I did n't ; so I told him just how to find the raft , and then he started . 
I struck an idea pretty soon . 
I says to myself , spos ' n he ca n't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep 's tail , as the saying is ? 
spos ' n it takes him three or four days ? 
What are we going to do ? -- lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag ? 
No , sir ; I know what _I'll_ do . 
I 'll wait , and when he comes back if he says he 's got to go any more I 'll get down there , too , if I swim ; and we 'll take and tie him , and keep him , and shove out down the river ; and when Tom 's done with him we 'll give him what it 's worth , or all we got , and then let him get ashore . 
So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep ; and next time I waked up the sun was away up over my head ! 
I shot out and went for the doctor 's house , but they told me he 'd gone away in the night some time or other , and war n't back yet . 
Well , thinks I , that looks powerful bad for Tom , and I 'll dig out for the island right off . 
So away I shoved , and turned the corner , and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's stomach ! 
He says : Why , _Tom ! _ Where you been all this time , you rascal ? 
I hai n't been nowheres , I says , only just hunting for the runaway nigger -- me and Sid . 
Why , where ever did you go ? 
he says . 
Your aunt 's been mighty uneasy . 
She need n't , I says , because we was all right . 
We followed the men and the dogs , but they outrun us , and we lost them ; but we thought we heard them on the water , so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over , but could n't find nothing of them ; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out ; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep , and never waked up till about an hour ago ; then we paddled over here to hear the news , and Sid 's at the post-office to see what he can hear , and I 'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us , and then we 're going home . 
So then we went to the post-office to get Sid ; but just as I suspicioned , he war n't there ; so the old man he got a letter out of the office , and we waited awhile longer , but Sid did n't come ; so the old man said , come along , let Sid foot it home , or canoe it , when he got done fooling around -- but we would ride . 
I could n't get him to let me stay and wait for Sid ; and he said there war n't no use in it , and I must come along , and let Aunt Sally see we was all right . 
When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both , and hugged me , and give me one of them lickings of hern that do n't amount to shucks , and said she 'd serve Sid the same when he come . 
And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers ' wives , to dinner ; and such another clack a body never heard . 
Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst ; her tongue was a-going all the time . 
She says : Well , Sister Phelps , I 've ransacked that-air cabin over , an ' I b'lieve the nigger was crazy . 
I says to Sister Damrell -- did n't I , Sister Damrell ? -- s ' I , he 's crazy , s ' I -- them 's the very words I said . 
You all hearn me : he 's crazy , s ' I ; everything shows it , s ' I . 
Look at that-air grindstone , s ' I ; want to tell _me_'t any cretur 't 's in his right mind 's a goin ' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone , s ' I ? 
Here sich ' n ' sich a person busted his heart ; ' n ' here so ' n ' so pegged along for thirty-seven year , ' n ' all that -- natcherl son o ' Louis somebody , ' n ' sich everlast ' n rubbage . 
He 's plumb crazy , s ' I ; it 's what I says in the fust place , it 's what I says in the middle , ' n ' it 's what I says last ' n ' all the time -- the nigger 's crazy -- crazy 's Nebokoodneezer , s ' I . 
An ' look at that-air ladder made out ' n rags , Sister Hotchkiss , says old Mrs. Damrell ; what in the name o ' goodness _could_ he ever want of -- The very words I was a-sayin ' no longer ago th ' n this minute to Sister Utterback , ' n ' she 'll tell you so herself . 
Sh-she , look at that-air rag ladder , sh-she ; ' n ' s ' I , yes , _look_ at it , s ' I -- what _could_ he a-wanted of it , s ' I . 
Sh-she , Sister Hotchkiss , sh-she -- But how in the nation 'd they ever _git_ that grindstone _in_ there , _anyway_ ? 
' n ' who dug that-air _hole_ ? 
' n ' who -- My very _words_ , Brer Penrod ! 
I was a-sayin ' -- pass that-air sasser o' m'lasses , wo n't ye ? -- I was a-sayin ' to Sister Dunlap , jist this minute , how _did_ they git that grindstone in there , s ' I . 
Without _help_ , mind you -- 'thout _help_ ! 
_that's_ wher 't is . 
Do n't tell _me_ , s ' I ; there _wuz_ help , s ' I ; ' n ' ther ' wuz a _plenty_ help , too , s ' I ; ther 's ben a _dozen_ a-helpin ' that nigger , ' n ' I lay I 'd skin every last nigger on this place but _I'd_ find out who done it , s ' I ; ' n ' moreover , s ' I -- A _dozen_ says you ! -- _forty_ could n't a done every thing that 's been done . 
Look at them case-knife saws and things , how tedious they 've been made ; look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm , a week 's work for six men ; look at that nigger made out ' n straw on the bed ; and look at -- You may _well_ say it , Brer Hightower ! 
It 's jist as I was a-sayin' to Brer Phelps , his own self . 
S ' e , what do _you_ think of it , Sister Hotchkiss , s ' e ? 
Think o ' what , Brer Phelps , s ' I ? 
Think o ' that bed-leg sawed off that a way , s ' e ? 
_think_ of it , s ' I ? 
I lay it never sawed _itself_ off , s ' I -- somebody _sawed_ it , s ' I ; that 's my opinion , take it or leave it , it may n't be no 'count , s ' I , but sich as 't is , it 's my opinion , s ' I , ' n ' if any body k ' n start a better one , s ' I , let him _do_ it , s ' I , that 's all . 
I says to Sister Dunlap , s ' I -- Why , dog my cats , they must a ben a house-full o ' niggers in there every night for four weeks to a done all that work , Sister Phelps . 
Look at that shirt -- every last inch of it kivered over with secret African writ ' n done with blood ! 
Must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along , all the time , amost . 
Why , I 'd give two dollars to have it read to me ; ' n' as for the niggers that wrote it , I 'low I 'd take ' n ' lash 'm t 'll -- People to _help_ him , Brother Marples ! 
Well , I reckon you 'd _think_ so if you 'd a been in this house for a while back . 
Why , they 've stole everything they could lay their hands on -- and we a-watching all the time , mind you . 
They stole that shirt right off o ' the line ! 
and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of , ther ' ai n't no telling how many times they _didn't_ steal that ; and flour , and candles , and candlesticks , and spoons , and the old warming-pan , and most a thousand things that I disremember now , and my new calico dress ; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day _and_ night , as I was a-telling you , and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them ; and here at the last minute , lo and behold you , they slides right in under our noses and fools us , and not only fools _us_ but the Injun Territory robbers too , and actuly gets _away_ with that nigger safe and sound , and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time ! 
I tell you , it just bangs anything I ever _heard_ of . 
Why , _sperits_ could n't a done better and been no smarter . 
And I reckon they must a _been_ sperits -- because , _you_ know our dogs , and ther ' ai n't no better ; well , them dogs never even got on the _track_ of 'm once ! 
You explain _that_ to me if you can ! -- _any_ of you ! 
Well , it does beat -- Laws alive , I never -- So help me , I would n't a be -- _House_-thieves as well as -- Goodnessgracioussakes , I 'd a ben afeard to live in sich a -- 'Fraid to _live_ ! -- why , I was that scared I das n't hardly go to bed , or get up , or lay down , or _set_ down , Sister Ridgeway . 
Why , they 'd steal the very -- why , goodness sakes , you can guess what kind of a fluster I was in by the time midnight come last night . 
I hope to gracious if I warn't afraid they 'd steal some o ' the family ! 
I was just to that pass I did n't have no reasoning faculties no more . 
It looks foolish enough _now_ , in the daytime ; but I says to myself , there 's my two poor boys asleep , 'way up stairs in that lonesome room , and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy 't I crep ' up there and locked 'em in ! 
I _did_ . 
And anybody would . 
Because , you know , when you get scared that way , and it keeps running on , and getting worse and worse all the time , and your wits gets to addling , and you get to doing all sorts o ' wild things , and by and by you think to yourself , spos ' n I was a boy , and was away up there , and the door ai n't locked , and you -- She stopped , looking kind of wondering , and then she turned her head around slow , and when her eye lit on me -- I got up and took a walk . 
Says I to myself , I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little . 
So I done it . 
But I das n't go fur , or she 'd a sent for me . 
And when it was late in the day the people all went , and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and Sid , and the door was locked , and we wanted to see the fun , so we went down the lightning-rod , and both of us got hurt a little , and we did n't never want to try _that_ no more . 
And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before ; and then she said she 'd forgive us , and maybe it was all right enough anyway , and about what a body might expect of boys , for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see ; and so , as long as no harm had n't come of it , she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still , stead of fretting over what was past and done . 
So then she kissed me , and patted me on the head , and dropped into a kind of a brown study ; and pretty soon jumps up , and says : Why , lawsamercy , it 's most night , and Sid not come yet ! 
What _has_ become of that boy ? 
I see my chance ; so I skips up and says : I 'll run right up to town and get him , I says . 
No you wo n't , she says . 
You 'll stay right wher ' you are ; _one's_ enough to be lost at a time . 
If he ai n't here to supper , your uncle 'll go . 
Well , he war n't there to supper ; so right after supper uncle went . 
He come back about ten a little bit uneasy ; had n't run across Tom's track . 
Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy ; but Uncle Silas he said there war n't no occasion to be -- boys will be boys , he said , and you'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right . 
So she had to be satisfied . 
But she said she 'd set up for him a while anyway , and keep a light burning so he could see it . 
And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle , and tucked me in , and mothered me so good I felt mean , and like I could n't look her in the face ; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time , and said what a splendid boy Sid was , and didn't seem to want to ever stop talking about him ; and kept asking me every now and then if I reckoned he could a got lost , or hurt , or maybe drownded , and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead , and she not by him to help him , and so the tears would drip down silent , and I would tell her that Sid was all right , and would be home in the morning , sure ; and she would squeeze my hand , or maybe kiss me , and tell me to say it again , and keep on saying it , because it done her good , and she was in so much trouble . 
And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle , and says : The door ai n't going to be locked , Tom , and there 's the window and the rod ; but you 'll be good , _won't_ you ? 
And you wo n't go ? 
For _my_ sake . 
Laws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom , and was all intending to go ; but after that I would n't a went , not for kingdoms . 
But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind , so I slept very restless . 
And twice I went down the rod away in the night , and slipped around front , and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them ; and I wished I could do something for her , but I could n't , only to swear that I would n't never do nothing to grieve her any more . 
And the third time I waked up at dawn , and slid down , and she was there yet , and her candle was most out , and her old gray head was resting on her hand , and she was asleep . 
. 
THE old man was uptown again before breakfast , but could n't get no track of Tom ; and both of them set at the table thinking , and not saying nothing , and looking mournful , and their coffee getting cold , and not eating anything . 
And by and by the old man says : Did I give you the letter ? 
What letter ? 
The one I got yesterday out of the post-office . 
No , you did n't give me no letter . 
Well , I must a forgot it . 
So he rummaged his pockets , and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down , and fetched it , and give it to her . 
She says : Why , it 's from St. Petersburg -- it 's from Sis . 
I allowed another walk would do me good ; but I could n't stir . 
But before she could break it open she dropped it and run -- for she see something . 
And so did I . 
It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress ; and that old doctor ; and Jim , in _her_ calico dress , with his hands tied behind him ; and a lot of people . 
I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy , and rushed . 
She flung herself at Tom , crying , and says : Oh , he 's dead , he 's dead , I know he 's dead ! 
And Tom he turned his head a little , and muttered something or other , which showed he war n't in his right mind ; then she flung up her hands , and says : He 's alive , thank God ! 
And that 's enough ! 
and she snatched a kiss of him , and flew for the house to get the bed ready , and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else , as fast as her tongue could go , every jump of the way . 
I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim ; and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house . 
The men was very huffy , and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the other niggers around there , so they would n't be trying to run away like Jim done , and making such a raft of trouble , and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights . 
But the others said , do n't do it , it would n't answer at all ; he ai n't our nigger , and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him , sure . 
So that cooled them down a little , because the people that 's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hai n't done just right is always the very ones that ai n't the most anxious to pay for him when they 've got their satisfaction out of him . 
They cussed Jim considerble , though , and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while , but Jim never said nothing , and he never let on to know me , and they took him to the same cabin , and put his own clothes on him , and chained him again , and not to no bed-leg this time , but to a big staple drove into the bottom log , and chained his hands , too , and both legs , and said he war n't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come , or he was sold at auction because he did n't come in a certain length of time , and filled up our hole , and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night , and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime ; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing , and then the old doctor comes and takes a look , and says : Do n't be no rougher on him than you 're obleeged to , because he ain't a bad nigger . 
When I got to where I found the boy I see I could n't cut the bullet out without some help , and he war n't in no condition for me to leave to go and get help ; and he got a little worse and a little worse , and after a long time he went out of his head , and would n't let me come a-nigh him any more , and said if I chalked his raft he 'd kill me , and no end of wild foolishness like that , and I see I could n't do anything at all with him ; so I says , I got to have _help_ somehow ; and the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he 'll help , and he done it , too , and done it very well . 
Of course I judged he must be a runaway nigger , and there I _was_ ! 
and there I had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night . 
It was a fix , I tell you ! 
I had a couple of patients with the chills , and of course I 'd of liked to run up to town and see them , but I das n't , because the nigger might get away , and then I 'd be to blame ; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail . 
So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning ; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller , and yet he was risking his freedom to do it , and was all tired out , too , and I see plain enough he 'd been worked main hard lately . 
I liked the nigger for that ; I tell you , gentlemen , a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars -- and kind treatment , too . 
I had everything I needed , and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home -- better , maybe , because it was so quiet ; but there I _was_ , with both of 'm on my hands , and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning ; then some men in a skiff come by , and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep ; so I motioned them in quiet , and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about , and we never had no trouble . 
And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep , too , we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on , and towed her over very nice and quiet , and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start . 
He ai n't no bad nigger , gentlemen ; that 's what I think about him . 
Somebody says : Well , it sounds very good , doctor , I 'm obleeged to say . 
Then the others softened up a little , too , and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn ; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him , too ; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him . 
Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well , and was deserving to have some notice took of it , and reward . 
So every one of them promised , right out and hearty , that they would n't cuss him no more . 
Then they come out and locked him up . 
I hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off , because they was rotten heavy , or could have meat and greens with his bread and water ; but they did n't think of it , and I reckoned it war n't best for me to mix in , but I judged I 'd get the doctor 's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I 'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me -- explanations , I mean , of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger . 
But I had plenty time . 
Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and all night , and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him . 
Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better , and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap . 
So I slips to the sick-room , and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash . 
But he was sleeping , and sleeping very peaceful , too ; and pale , not fire-faced the way he was when he come . 
So I set down and laid for him to wake . 
In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in , and there I was , up a stump again ! 
She motioned me to be still , and set down by me , and begun to whisper , and said we could all be joyful now , because all the symptoms was first-rate , and he 'd been sleeping like that for ever so long , and looking better and peacefuller all the time , and ten to one he 'd wake up in his right mind . 
So we set there watching , and by and by he stirs a bit , and opened his eyes very natural , and takes a look , and says : Hello ! -- why , I 'm at _home_ ! 
How 's that ? 
Where 's the raft ? 
It 's all right , I says . 
And _Jim_ ? 
The same , I says , but could n't say it pretty brash . 
But he never noticed , but says : Good ! 
Splendid ! 
_Now_ we 're all right and safe ! 
Did you tell Aunty ? 
I was going to say yes ; but she chipped in and says : About what , Sid ? 
Why , about the way the whole thing was done . 
What whole thing ? 
Why , _the_ whole thing . 
There ai n't but one ; how we set the runaway nigger free -- me and Tom . 
Good land ! 
Set the run -- What _is_ the child talking about ! 
Dear , dear , out of his head again ! 
_No_ , I ai n't out of my _head_ ; I know all what I 'm talking about . 
We _did_ set him free -- me and Tom . 
We laid out to do it , and we _done_ it . 
And we done it elegant , too . 
He 'd got a start , and she never checked him up , just set and stared and stared , and let him clip along , and I see it war n't no use for _me_ to put in . 
Why , Aunty , it cost us a power of work -- weeks of it -- hours and hours , every night , whilst you was all asleep . 
And we had to steal candles , and the sheet , and the shirt , and your dress , and spoons , and tin plates , and case-knives , and the warming-pan , and the grindstone , and flour , and just no end of things , and you ca n't think what work it was to make the saws , and pens , and inscriptions , and one thing or another , and you ca n't think _half_ the fun it was . 
And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things , and nonnamous letters from the robbers , and get up and down the lightning-rod , and dig the hole into the cabin , and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie , and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket -- Mercy sakes ! 
-- and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on , for company for Jim ; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business , because the men come before we was out of the cabin , and we had to rush , and they heard us and let drive at us , and I got my share , and we dodged out of the path and let them go by , and when the dogs come they war n't interested in us , but went for the most noise , and we got our canoe , and made for the raft , and was all safe , and Jim was a free man , and we done it all by ourselves , and _wasn't_ it bully , Aunty ! 
Well , I never heard the likes of it in all my born days ! 
So it was _you_ , you little rapscallions , that 's been making all this trouble , and turned everybody 's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death . 
I 've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o ' you this very minute . 
To think , here I 've been , night after night , a -- _you_ just get well once , you young scamp , and I lay I 'll tan the Old Harry out o ' both o ' ye ! 
But Tom , he _was_ so proud and joyful , he just _couldn't_ hold in , and his tongue just _went_ it -- she a-chipping in , and spitting fire all along , and both of them going it at once , like a cat convention ; and she says : _Well_ , you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_ , for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again -- Meddling with _who_ ? 
Tom says , dropping his smile and looking surprised . 
With _who_ ? 
Why , the runaway nigger , of course . 
Who 'd you reckon ? 
Tom looks at me very grave , and says : Tom , did n't you just tell me he was all right ? 
Has n't he got away ? 
_Him_ ? 
says Aunt Sally ; the runaway nigger ? 
'Deed he has n't . 
They 've got him back , safe and sound , and he 's in that cabin again , on bread and water , and loaded down with chains , till he 's claimed or sold ! 
Tom rose square up in bed , with his eye hot , and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills , and sings out to me : They hai n't no _right_ to shut him up ! 
SHOVE ! -- and do n't you lose a minute . 
Turn him loose ! 
he ai n't no slave ; he 's as free as any cretur that walks this earth ! 
What _does_ the child mean ? 
I mean every word I _say_ , Aunt Sally , and if somebody do n't go , _I'll_ go . 
I 've knowed him all his life , and so has Tom , there . 
Old Miss Watson died two months ago , and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river , and _said_ so ; and she set him free in her will . 
Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for , seeing he was already free ? 
Well , that _is_ a question , I must say ; and just like women ! 
Why , I wanted the _adventure_ of it ; and I 'd a waded neck-deep in blood to -- goodness alive , _Aunt Polly ! _ If she war n't standing right there , just inside the door , looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie , I wish I may never ! 
Aunt Sally jumped for her , and most hugged the head off of her , and cried over her , and I found a good enough place for me under the bed , for it was getting pretty sultry for us , seemed to me . 
And I peeped out , and in a little while Tom 's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles -- kind of grinding him into the earth , you know . 
And then she says : Yes , you _better_ turn y ' r head away -- I would if I was you , Tom . 
Oh , deary me ! 
says Aunt Sally ; _Is_ he changed so ? 
Why , that ain't _Tom_ , it 's Sid ; Tom 's -- Tom 's -- why , where is Tom ? 
He was here a minute ago . 
You mean where 's Huck _Finn_ -- that 's what you mean ! 
I reckon I hain't raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I _see_ him . 
That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do . 
Come out from under that bed , Huck Finn . 
So I done it . 
But not feeling brash . 
Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see -- except one , and that was Uncle Silas , when he come in and they told it all to him . 
It kind of made him drunk , as you may say , and he didn't know nothing at all the rest of the day , and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation , because the oldest man in the world could n't a understood it . 
So Tom 's Aunt Polly , she told all about who I was , and what ; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer -- she chipped in and says , Oh , go on and call me Aunt Sally , I'm used to it now , and 'tai n't no need to change -- that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it -- there war n't no other way , and I knowed he would n't mind , because it would be nuts for him , being a mystery , and he 'd make an adventure out of it , and be perfectly satisfied . 
And so it turned out , and he let on to be Sid , and made things as soft as he could for me . 
And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will ; and so , sure enough , Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free ! 
and I couldn't ever understand before , until that minute and that talk , how he _could_ help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up . 
Well , Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and _Sid_ had come all right and safe , she says to herself : Look at that , now ! 
I might have expected it , letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him . 
So now I got to go and trapse all the way down the river , eleven hundred mile , and find out what that creetur 's up to _this_ time , as long as I could n't seem to get any answer out of you about it . 
Why , I never heard nothing from you , says Aunt Sally . 
Well , I wonder ! 
Why , I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by Sid being here . 
Well , I never got 'em , Sis . 
Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe , and says : You , Tom ! 
Well -- _what_ ? 
he says , kind of pettish . 
Do n't you what _me_ , you impudent thing -- hand out them letters . 
What letters ? 
_Them_ letters . 
I be bound , if I have to take a-holt of you I 'll -- They 're in the trunk . 
There , now . 
And they 're just the same as they was when I got them out of the office . 
I hai n't looked into them , I hai n't touched them . 
But I knowed they 'd make trouble , and I thought if you war n't in no hurry , I 'd -- Well , you _do_ need skinning , there ai n't no mistake about it . 
And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming ; and I s'pose he -- No , it come yesterday ; I hai n't read it yet , but _it's_ all right , I've got that one . 
I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she had n't , but I reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to . 
So I never said nothing . 
CHAPTER THE LAST THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea , time of the evasion ? -- what it was he 'd planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before ? 
And he said , what he had planned in his head from the start , if we got Jim out all safe , was for us to run him down the river on the raft , and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river , and then tell him about his being free , and take him back up home on a steamboat , in style , and pay him for his lost time , and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around , and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band , and then he would be a hero , and so would we . 
But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was . 
We had Jim out of the chains in no time , and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom , they made a heap of fuss over him , and fixed him up prime , and give him all he wanted to eat , and a good time , and nothing to do . 
And we had him up to the sick-room , and had a high talk ; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient , and doing it up so good , and Jim was pleased most to death , and busted out , and says : Dah , now , Huck , what I tell you ? -- what I tell you up dah on Jackson islan ' ? 
I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas ' , en what 's de sign un it ; en I _tole_ you I ben rich wunst , en gwineter to be rich _agin_ ; en it's come true ; en heah she is ! 
_dah_ , now ! 
doan ' talk to _me_ -- signs is _signs_ , mine I tell you ; en I knowed jis ' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be rich agin as I 's a-stannin ' heah dis minute ! 
And then Tom he talked along and talked along , and says , le 's all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit , and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns , over in the Territory , for a couple of weeks or two ; and I says , all right , that suits me , but I ai n't got no money for to buy the outfit , and I reckon I could n't get none from home , because it 's likely pap 's been back before now , and got it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up . 
No , he hai n't , Tom says ; it 's all there yet -- six thousand dollars and more ; and your pap hai n't ever been back since . 
Had n't when I come away , anyhow . 
Jim says , kind of solemn : He ai n't a-comin ' back no mo ' , Huck . 
I says : Why , Jim ? 
Nemmine why , Huck -- but he ai n't comin ' back no mo . 
But I kept at him ; so at last he says : Doan ' you 'member de house dat was float ' n down de river , en dey wuz a man in dah , kivered up , en I went in en unkivered him and didn ' let you come in ? 
Well , den , you kin git yo ' money when you wants it , kase dat wuz him . 
Tom 's most well now , and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard for a watch , and is always seeing what time it is , and so there ain't nothing more to write about , and I am rotten glad of it , because if I'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I would n't a tackled it , and ai n't a-going to no more . 
But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest , because Aunt Sally she 's going to adopt me and sivilize me , and I ca n't stand it . 
I been there before .
