THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS

By Lewis Carroll


The Millennium Fulcrum Edition 1.7




 STOP Looking-Glass house

One thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to do with
it:--it was the black kitten's fault entirely STOP For the white kitten had
been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of
an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it
COULDN'T have had any hand in the mischief STOP The way Dinah washed her children's faces was this: first she held the
poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she
rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and
just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was
lying quite still and trying to purr--no doubt feeling that it was all
meant for its good STOP But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon,
and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great
arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been
having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been
trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all
come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all
knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the
middle STOP 'Oh, you wicked little thing! STOP cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and
giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace STOP 'Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners STOP You OUGHT,
Dinah, you know you ought! STOP she added, looking reproachfully at the old
cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage--and then she
scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted
with her, and began winding up the ball again STOP But she didn't get on
very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and
sometimes to herself STOP Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to
watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one
paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it
might STOP 'Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty? STOP Alice began STOP 'You'd have guessed
if you'd been up in the window with me--only Dinah was making you tidy,
so you couldn't STOP I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the
bonfire--and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty STOP Only it got so cold, and
it snowed so, they had to leave off STOP Never mind, Kitty, we'll go and
see the bonfire to-morrow. STOP Here Alice wound two or three turns of the
worsted round the kitten's neck, just to see how it would look: this led
to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards
and yards of it got unwound again STOP 'Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,' Alice went on as soon as they were
comfortably settled again, 'when I saw all the mischief you had been
doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into
the snow STOP And you'd have deserved it, you little mischievous darling STOP What have you got to say for yourself STOP Now don't interrupt me! STOP she
went on, holding up one finger STOP 'I'm going to tell you all your faults STOP Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this
morning STOP Now you can't deny it, Kitty: I heard you STOP What's that you
say? STOP (pretending that the kitten was speaking. STOP 'Her paw went into your
eye STOP Well, that's YOUR fault, for keeping your eyes open--if you'd
shut them tight up, it wouldn't have happened STOP Now don't make any more
excuses, but listen STOP Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail
just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her STOP What, you were
thirsty, were you STOP How do you know she wasn't thirsty too STOP Now for
number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn't
looking STOP 'That's three faults, Kitty, and you've not been punished for any of
them yet STOP You know I'm saving up all your punishments for Wednesday
week--Suppose they had saved up all MY punishments! STOP she went on,
talking more to herself than the kitten STOP 'What WOULD they do at the end
of a year STOP I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came STOP Or--let me see--suppose each punishment was to be going without a
dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without
fifty dinners at once STOP Well, I shouldn't mind THAT much STOP I'd far rather
go without them than eat them STOP 'Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty STOP How nice and soft
it sounds STOP Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside STOP I wonder if the snow LOVES the trees and fields, that it kisses them so
gently STOP And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt;
and perhaps it says, "Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes
again. STOP And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress
themselves all in green, and dance about--whenever the wind blows--oh,
that's very pretty! STOP cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap
her hands STOP 'And I do so WISH it was true STOP I'm sure the woods look sleepy
in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown STOP 'Kitty, can you play chess STOP Now, don't smile, my dear, I'm asking it
seriously STOP Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as
if you understood it: and when I said "Check! STOP you purred STOP Well, it WAS
a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn't been for
that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces STOP Kitty, dear,
let's pretend--' And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice
used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase 'Let's pretend. STOP She
had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before--all
because Alice had begun with 'Let's pretend we're kings and queens;' and
her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn't,
because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last
to say, 'Well, YOU can be one of them then, and I'LL be all the rest. STOP And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in
her ear, 'Nurse STOP Do let's pretend that I'm a hungry hyaena, and you're a
bone. STOP But this is taking us away from Alice's speech to the kitten STOP 'Let's
pretend that you're the Red Queen, Kitty STOP Do you know, I think if you
sat up and folded your arms, you'd look exactly like her STOP Now do try,
there's a dear! STOP And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it
up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing
didn't succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn't
fold its arms properly STOP So, to punish it, she held it up to the
Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was--'and if you're not
good directly,' she added, 'I'll put you through into Looking-glass
House STOP How would you like THAT? STOP 'Now, if you'll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I'll tell you
all my ideas about Looking-glass House STOP First, there's the room you can
see through the glass--that's just the same as our drawing room, only
the things go the other way STOP I can see all of it when I get upon a
chair--all but the bit behind the fireplace STOP Oh STOP I do so wish I could
see THAT bit STOP I want so much to know whether they've a fire in the
winter: you never CAN tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then
smoke comes up in that room too--but that may be only pretence, just to
make it look as if they had a fire STOP Well then, the books are something
like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because
I've held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in
the other room STOP 'How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty STOP I wonder if
they'd give you milk in there STOP Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn't good
to drink--But oh, Kitty STOP now we come to the passage STOP You can just see a
little PEEP of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door
of our drawing-room wide open: and it's very like our passage as far
as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond STOP Oh, Kitty STOP how nice it would be if we could only get through into
Looking-glass House STOP I'm sure it's got, oh STOP such beautiful things in it STOP Let's pretend there's a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty STOP Let's pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get
through STOP Why, it's turning into a sort of mist now, I declare STOP It'll be
easy enough to get through--' She was up on the chimney-piece while she
said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there STOP And certainly
the glass WAS beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist STOP In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly
down into the Looking-glass room STOP The very first thing she did was
to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite
pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as
the one she had left behind STOP 'So I shall be as warm here as I was in the
old room,' thought Alice: 'warmer, in fact, because there'll be no one
here to scold me away from the fire STOP Oh, what fun it'll be, when they
see me through the glass in here, and can't get at me! STOP Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from
the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest
was as different as possible STOP For instance, the pictures on the
wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on
the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the
Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her STOP 'They don't keep this room so tidy as the other,' Alice thought to
herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among
the cinders: but in another moment, with a little 'Oh! STOP of surprise, she
was down on her hands and knees watching them STOP The chessmen were walking
about, two and two STOP 'Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,' Alice said (in a whisper, for
fear of frightening them), 'and there are the White King and the White
Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel--and here are two castles
walking arm in arm--I don't think they can hear me,' she went on, as she
put her head closer down, 'and I'm nearly sure they can't see me STOP I feel
somehow as if I were invisible--'

Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her
turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and
begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would
happen next STOP 'It is the voice of my child! STOP the White Queen cried out as she rushed
past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders STOP 'My precious Lily STOP My imperial kitten! STOP and she began scrambling wildly
up the side of the fender STOP 'Imperial fiddlestick! STOP said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been
hurt by the fall STOP He had a right to be a LITTLE annoyed with the Queen,
for he was covered with ashes from head to foot STOP Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was
nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and
set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter STOP The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had
quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing
but hug the little Lily in silence STOP As soon as she had recovered her
breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting
sulkily among the ashes, 'Mind the volcano! STOP 'What volcano? STOP said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if
he thought that was the most likely place to find one STOP 'Blew--me--up,' panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath STOP 'Mind you come up--the regular way--don't get blown up! STOP Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar,
till at last she said, 'Why, you'll be hours and hours getting to the
table, at that rate STOP I'd far better help you, hadn't I? STOP But the King
took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither
hear her nor see her STOP So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly
than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn't take his breath away:
but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust
him a little, he was so covered with ashes STOP She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face
as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible
hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but
his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder
and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let
him drop upon the floor STOP 'Oh STOP PLEASE don't make such faces, my dear! STOP she cried out, quite
forgetting that the King couldn't hear her STOP 'You make me laugh so that
I can hardly hold you STOP And don't keep your mouth so wide open STOP All the
ashes will get into it--there, now I think you're tidy enough! STOP she
added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the
Queen STOP The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and
Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room
to see if she could find any water to throw over him STOP However, she could
find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she
found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a
frightened whisper--so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said STOP The King was saying, 'I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very
ends of my whiskers! STOP To which the Queen replied, 'You haven't got any whiskers. STOP 'The horror of that moment,' the King went on, 'I shall never, NEVER
forget! STOP 'You will, though,' the Queen said, 'if you don't make a memorandum of
it. STOP Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous
memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing STOP A sudden thought
struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some
way over his shoulder, and began writing for him STOP The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil
for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him,
and at last he panted out, 'My dear STOP I really MUST get a thinner pencil STOP I can't manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I
don't intend--'

'What manner of things? STOP said the Queen, looking over the book (in which
Alice had put 'THE WHITE KNIGHT IS SLIDING DOWN THE POKER STOP HE BALANCES
VERY BADLY') 'That's not a memorandum of YOUR feelings! STOP There was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat
watching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him,
and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again),
she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read,
'--for it's all in some language I don't know,' she said to herself STOP It was like this STOP YKCOWREBBAJ

She puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck
her STOP 'Why, it's a Looking-glass book, of course STOP And if I hold it up to
a glass, the words will all go the right way again. STOP This was the poem that Alice read STOP JABBERWOCKY

     'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe STOP 'Beware the Jabberwock, my son STOP The jaws that bite, the claws that catch STOP Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
      The frumious Bandersnatch! STOP He took his vorpal sword in hand:
      Long time the manxome foe he sought--
     So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
      And stood awhile in thought STOP And as in uffish thought he stood,
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
     Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
      And burbled as it came STOP One, two STOP One, two STOP And through and through
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack STOP He left it dead, and with its head
      He went galumphing back STOP 'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock STOP Come to my arms, my beamish boy STOP O frabjous day STOP Callooh STOP Callay! STOP He chortled in his joy STOP 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe STOP 'It seems very pretty,' she said when she had finished it, 'but it's
RATHER hard to understand! STOP (You see she didn't like to confess, even
to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all. STOP 'Somehow it seems
to fill my head with ideas--only I don't exactly know what they are STOP However, SOMEBODY killed SOMETHING: that's clear, at any rate--'

'But oh! STOP thought Alice, suddenly jumping up, 'if I don't make haste I
shall have to go back through the Looking-glass, before I've seen what
the rest of the house is like STOP Let's have a look at the garden first! STOP She was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairs--or, at least,
it wasn't exactly running, but a new invention of hers for getting down
stairs quickly and easily, as Alice said to herself STOP She just kept the
tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated gently down without
even touching the stairs with her feet; then she floated on through the
hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way, if
she hadn't caught hold of the door-post STOP She was getting a little giddy
with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself
walking again in the natural way STOP  STOP The Garden of Live Flowers

'I should see the garden far better,' said Alice to herself, 'if I could
get to the top of that hill: and here's a path that leads straight to
it--at least, no, it doesn't do that--' (after going a few yards along
the path, and turning several sharp corners), 'but I suppose it will
at last STOP But how curiously it twists STOP It's more like a corkscrew than a
path STOP Well, THIS turn goes to the hill, I suppose--no, it doesn't STOP This
goes straight back to the house STOP Well then, I'll try it the other way. STOP And so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but
always coming back to the house, do what she would STOP Indeed, once, when
she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it
before she could stop herself STOP 'It's no use talking about it,' Alice said, looking up at the house and
pretending it was arguing with her STOP 'I'm NOT going in again yet STOP I know
I should have to get through the Looking-glass again--back into the old
room--and there'd be an end of all my adventures! STOP So, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more
down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill STOP For a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, 'I really
SHALL do it this time--' when the path gave a sudden twist and shook
itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found
herself actually walking in at the door STOP 'Oh, it's too bad! STOP she cried STOP 'I never saw such a house for getting in
the way STOP Never! STOP However, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be
done but start again STOP This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a
border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle STOP 'O Tiger-lily,' said Alice, addressing herself to one that was waving
gracefully about in the wind, 'I WISH you could talk! STOP 'We CAN talk,' said the Tiger-lily: 'when there's anybody worth talking
to. STOP Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite
seemed to take her breath away STOP At length, as the Tiger-lily only went
on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice--almost in a whisper STOP 'And can ALL the flowers talk? STOP 'As well as YOU can,' said the Tiger-lily STOP 'And a great deal louder. STOP 'It isn't manners for us to begin, you know,' said the Rose, 'and I
really was wondering when you'd speak STOP Said I to myself, "Her face has
got SOME sense in it, though it's not a clever one! STOP Still, you're the
right colour, and that goes a long way. STOP 'I don't care about the colour,' the Tiger-lily remarked STOP 'If only her
petals curled up a little more, she'd be all right. STOP Alice didn't like being criticised, so she began asking questions STOP 'Aren't you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody
to take care of you? STOP 'There's the tree in the middle,' said the Rose: 'what else is it good
for? STOP 'But what could it do, if any danger came? STOP Alice asked STOP 'It says "Bough-wough!" STOP cried a Daisy: 'that's why its branches are
called boughs! STOP 'Didn't you know THAT? STOP cried another Daisy, and here they all began
shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill
voices STOP 'Silence, every one of you! STOP cried the Tiger-lily, waving itself
passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement STOP 'They
know I can't get at them! STOP it panted, bending its quivering head towards
Alice, 'or they wouldn't dare to do it! STOP 'Never mind! STOP Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the
daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, 'If you don't
hold your tongues, I'll pick you! STOP There was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned
white STOP 'That's right! STOP said the Tiger-lily STOP 'The daisies are worst of all STOP When
one speaks, they all begin together, and it's enough to make one wither
to hear the way they go on! STOP 'How is it you can all talk so nicely? STOP Alice said, hoping to get it
into a better temper by a compliment STOP 'I've been in many gardens before,
but none of the flowers could talk. STOP 'Put your hand down, and feel the ground,' said the Tiger-lily STOP 'Then
you'll know why. STOP Alice did so STOP 'It's very hard,' she said, 'but I don't see what that has
to do with it. STOP 'In most gardens,' the Tiger-lily said, 'they make the beds too soft--so
that the flowers are always asleep. STOP This sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased to know it STOP 'I never thought of that before! STOP she said STOP 'It's MY opinion that you never think AT ALL,' the Rose said in a rather
severe tone STOP 'I never saw anybody that looked stupider,' a Violet said, so suddenly,
that Alice quite jumped; for it hadn't spoken before STOP 'Hold YOUR tongue! STOP cried the Tiger-lily STOP 'As if YOU ever saw anybody STOP You keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know
no more what's going on in the world, than if you were a bud! STOP 'Are there any more people in the garden besides me? STOP Alice said, not
choosing to notice the Rose's last remark STOP 'There's one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,'
said the Rose STOP 'I wonder how you do it--' ('You're always wondering,'
said the Tiger-lily), 'but she's more bushy than you are. STOP 'Is she like me? STOP Alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind,
'There's another little girl in the garden, somewhere! STOP 'Well, she has the same awkward shape as you,' the Rose said, 'but she's
redder--and her petals are shorter, I think. STOP 'Her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,' the Tiger-lily
interrupted: 'not tumbled about anyhow, like yours. STOP 'But that's not YOUR fault,' the Rose added kindly: 'you're beginning
to fade, you know--and then one can't help one's petals getting a little
untidy. STOP Alice didn't like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked
'Does she ever come out here? STOP 'I daresay you'll see her soon,' said the Rose STOP 'She's one of the thorny
kind. STOP 'Where does she wear the thorns? STOP Alice asked with some curiosity STOP 'Why all round her head, of course,' the Rose replied STOP 'I was wondering
YOU hadn't got some too STOP I thought it was the regular rule. STOP 'She's coming! STOP cried the Larkspur STOP 'I hear her footstep, thump, thump,
thump, along the gravel-walk! STOP Alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the Red Queen STOP 'She's
grown a good deal! STOP was her first remark STOP She had indeed: when Alice
first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high--and
here she was, half a head taller than Alice herself STOP 'It's the fresh air that does it,' said the Rose: 'wonderfully fine air
it is, out here. STOP 'I think I'll go and meet her,' said Alice, for, though the flowers were
interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk
with a real Queen STOP 'You can't possibly do that,' said the Rose: '_I_ should advise you to
walk the other way. STOP This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at
once towards the Red Queen STOP To her surprise, she lost sight of her in a
moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again STOP A little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the
queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she
would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction STOP It succeeded beautifully STOP She had not been walking a minute before she
found herself face to face with the Red Queen, and full in sight of the
hill she had been so long aiming at STOP 'Where do you come from? STOP said the Red Queen STOP 'And where are you going STOP Look up, speak nicely, and don't twiddle your fingers all the time. STOP Alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she
could, that she had lost her way STOP 'I don't know what you mean by YOUR way,' said the Queen: 'all the ways
about here belong to ME--but why did you come out here at all? STOP she
added in a kinder tone STOP 'Curtsey while you're thinking what to say, it
saves time. STOP Alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the
Queen to disbelieve it STOP 'I'll try it when I go home,' she thought to
herself, 'the next time I'm a little late for dinner. STOP 'It's time for you to answer now,' the Queen said, looking at her watch:
'open your mouth a LITTLE wider when you speak, and always say "your
Majesty." STOP 'I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty--'

'That's right,' said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alice
didn't like at all, 'though, when you say "garden,"--I'VE seen gardens,
compared with which this would be a wilderness. STOP Alice didn't dare to argue the point, but went on: '--and I thought I'd
try and find my way to the top of that hill--'

'When you say "hill,"' the Queen interrupted, '_I_ could show you hills,
in comparison with which you'd call that a valley. STOP 'No, I shouldn't,' said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at last:
'a hill CAN'T be a valley, you know STOP That would be nonsense--'

The Red Queen shook her head, 'You may call it "nonsense" if you like,'
she said, 'but I'VE heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as
sensible as a dictionary! STOP Alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queen's tone that she
was a LITTLE offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to
the top of the little hill STOP For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all
directions over the country--and a most curious country it was STOP There
were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side
to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number
of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook STOP 'I declare it's marked out just like a large chessboard! STOP Alice said at
last STOP 'There ought to be some men moving about somewhere--and so there
are! STOP She added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick
with excitement as she went on STOP 'It's a great huge game of chess that's
being played--all over the world--if this IS the world at all, you know STOP Oh, what fun it is STOP How I WISH I was one of them STOP I wouldn't mind being
a Pawn, if only I might join--though of course I should LIKE to be a
Queen, best. STOP She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but her
companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, 'That's easily managed STOP You
can be the White Queen's Pawn, if you like, as Lily's too young to
play; and you're in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to
the Eighth Square you'll be a Queen--' Just at this moment, somehow or
other, they began to run STOP Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it
was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand
in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep
up with her: and still the Queen kept crying 'Faster STOP Faster! STOP but Alice
felt she COULD NOT go faster, though she had not breath left to say so STOP The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other
things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they
went, they never seemed to pass anything STOP 'I wonder if all the things
move along with us? STOP thought poor puzzled Alice STOP And the Queen seemed to
guess her thoughts, for she cried, 'Faster STOP Don't try to talk! STOP Not that Alice had any idea of doing THAT STOP She felt as if she would
never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and
still the Queen cried 'Faster STOP Faster! STOP and dragged her along STOP 'Are we
nearly there? STOP Alice managed to pant out at last STOP 'Nearly there! STOP the Queen repeated STOP 'Why, we passed it ten minutes ago STOP Faster! STOP And they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling
in Alice's ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied STOP 'Now STOP Now! STOP cried the Queen STOP 'Faster STOP Faster! STOP And they went so fast
that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the
ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite
exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground,
breathless and giddy STOP The Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, 'You may rest
a little now. STOP Alice looked round her in great surprise STOP 'Why, I do believe we've been
under this tree the whole time STOP Everything's just as it was! STOP 'Of course it is,' said the Queen, 'what would you have it? STOP 'Well, in OUR country,' said Alice, still panting a little, 'you'd
generally get to somewhere else--if you ran very fast for a long time,
as we've been doing. STOP 'A slow sort of country! STOP said the Queen STOP 'Now, HERE, you see, it takes
all the running YOU can do, to keep in the same place STOP If you want to
get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that! STOP 'I'd rather not try, please! STOP said Alice STOP 'I'm quite content to stay
here--only I AM so hot and thirsty! STOP 'I know what YOU'D like! STOP the Queen said good-naturedly, taking a little
box out of her pocket STOP 'Have a biscuit? STOP Alice thought it would not be civil to say 'No,' though it wasn't at all
what she wanted STOP So she took it, and ate it as well as she could: and it
was VERY dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all
her life STOP 'While you're refreshing yourself,' said the Queen, 'I'll just take
the measurements. STOP And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in
inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here
and there STOP 'At the end of two yards,' she said, putting in a peg to mark the
distance, 'I shall give you your directions--have another biscuit? STOP 'No, thank you,' said Alice: 'one's QUITE enough! STOP 'Thirst quenched, I hope? STOP said the Queen STOP Alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did not
wait for an answer, but went on STOP 'At the end of THREE yards I shall
repeat them--for fear of your forgetting them STOP At the end of FOUR, I
shall say good-bye STOP And at the end of FIVE, I shall go! STOP She had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on
with great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly
walking down the row STOP At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, 'A pawn goes two squares
in its first move, you know STOP So you'll go VERY quickly through the Third
Square--by railway, I should think--and you'll find yourself in the
Fourth Square in no time STOP Well, THAT square belongs to Tweedledum and
Tweedledee--the Fifth is mostly water--the Sixth belongs to Humpty
Dumpty--But you make no remark? STOP 'I--I didn't know I had to make one--just then,' Alice faltered out STOP 'You SHOULD have said, "It's extremely kind of you to tell me all
this"--however, we'll suppose it said--the Seventh Square is all
forest--however, one of the Knights will show you the way--and in the
Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and it's all feasting and
fun! STOP Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again STOP At the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said, 'Speak
in French when you can't think of the English for a thing--turn out your
toes as you walk--and remember who you are! STOP She did not wait for Alice
to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she
turned for a moment to say 'good-bye,' and then hurried on to the last STOP How it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last
peg, she was gone STOP Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she
ran quickly into the wood ('and she CAN run very fast! STOP thought Alice),
there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began to
remember that she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to
move STOP  STOP Looking-Glass Insects

Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the
country she was going to travel through STOP 'It's something very like
learning geography,' thought Alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of
being able to see a little further STOP 'Principal rivers--there ARE none STOP Principal mountains--I'm on the only one, but I don't think it's got any
name STOP Principal towns--why, what ARE those creatures, making honey down
there STOP They can't be bees--nobody ever saw bees a mile off, you know--'
and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that was
bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them, 'just
as if it was a regular bee,' thought Alice STOP However, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an
elephant--as Alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath
away at first STOP 'And what enormous flowers they must be! STOP was her next
idea STOP 'Something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put
to them--and what quantities of honey they must make STOP I think I'll go
down and--no, I won't JUST yet,' she went on, checking herself just as
she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse
for turning shy so suddenly STOP 'It'll never do to go down among them
without a good long branch to brush them away--and what fun it'll be
when they ask me how I like my walk STOP I shall say--"Oh, I like it well
enough--"' (here came the favourite little toss of the head), '"only it
was so dusty and hot, and the elephants did tease so!" STOP 'I think I'll go down the other way,' she said after a pause: 'and
perhaps I may visit the elephants later on STOP Besides, I do so want to get
into the Third Square! STOP So with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of
the six little brooks STOP 'Tickets, please! STOP said the Guard, putting his head in at the window STOP In a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about the same
size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage STOP 'Now then STOP Show your ticket, child! STOP the Guard went on, looking angrily
at Alice STOP And a great many voices all said together ('like the chorus of
a song,' thought Alice), 'Don't keep him waiting, child STOP Why, his time
is worth a thousand pounds a minute! STOP 'I'm afraid I haven't got one,' Alice said in a frightened tone: 'there
wasn't a ticket-office where I came from. STOP And again the chorus of
voices went on STOP 'There wasn't room for one where she came from STOP The land
there is worth a thousand pounds an inch! STOP 'Don't make excuses,' said the Guard: 'you should have bought one from
the engine-driver. STOP And once more the chorus of voices went on with 'The
man that drives the engine STOP Why, the smoke alone is worth a thousand
pounds a puff! STOP Alice thought to herself, 'Then there's no use in speaking. STOP The
voices didn't join in this time, as she hadn't spoken, but to her
great surprise, they all THOUGHT in chorus (I hope you understand what
THINKING IN CHORUS means--for I must confess that _I_ don't), 'Better
say nothing at all STOP Language is worth a thousand pounds a word! STOP 'I shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, I know I shall! STOP thought
Alice STOP All this time the Guard was looking at her, first through a telescope,
then through a microscope, and then through an opera-glass STOP At last he
said, 'You're travelling the wrong way,' and shut up the window and went
away STOP 'So young a child,' said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he was
dressed in white paper), 'ought to know which way she's going, even if
she doesn't know her own name! STOP A Goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his
eyes and said in a loud voice, 'She ought to know her way to the
ticket-office, even if she doesn't know her alphabet! STOP There was a Beetle sitting next to the Goat (it was a very queer
carriage-full of passengers altogether), and, as the rule seemed to be
that they should all speak in turn, HE went on with 'She'll have to go
back from here as luggage! STOP Alice couldn't see who was sitting beyond the Beetle, but a hoarse voice
spoke next STOP 'Change engines--' it said, and was obliged to leave off STOP 'It sounds like a horse,' Alice thought to herself STOP And an extremely
small voice, close to her ear, said, 'You might make a joke on
that--something about "horse" and "hoarse," you know. STOP Then a very gentle voice in the distance said, 'She must be labelled
"Lass, with care," you know--'

And after that other voices went on ('What a number of people there are
in the carriage! STOP thought Alice), saying, 'She must go by post, as she's
got a head on her--' 'She must be sent as a message by the telegraph--'
'She must draw the train herself the rest of the way--' and so on STOP But the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered
in her ear, 'Never mind what they all say, my dear, but take a
return-ticket every time the train stops. STOP 'Indeed I shan't! STOP Alice said rather impatiently STOP 'I don't belong to
this railway journey at all--I was in a wood just now--and I wish I
could get back there. STOP 'You might make a joke on THAT,' said the little voice close to her ear:
'something about "you WOULD if you could," you know. STOP 'Don't tease so,' said Alice, looking about in vain to see where the
voice came from; 'if you're so anxious to have a joke made, why don't
you make one yourself? STOP The little voice sighed deeply: it was VERY unhappy, evidently, and
Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it, 'If it would only
sigh like other people! STOP she thought STOP But this was such a wonderfully
small sigh, that she wouldn't have heard it at all, if it hadn't come
QUITE close to her ear STOP The consequence of this was that it tickled her
ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of
the poor little creature STOP 'I know you are a friend,' the little voice went on; 'a dear friend, and
an old friend STOP And you won't hurt me, though I AM an insect. STOP 'What kind of insect? STOP Alice inquired a little anxiously STOP What she
really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she
thought this wouldn't be quite a civil question to ask STOP 'What, then you don't--' the little voice began, when it was drowned by
a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in alarm, Alice
among the rest STOP The Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in
and said, 'It's only a brook we have to jump over. STOP Everybody seemed
satisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of
trains jumping at all STOP 'However, it'll take us into the Fourth Square,
that's some comfort! STOP she said to herself STOP In another moment she felt
the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in her fright she caught
at the thing nearest to her hand, which happened to be the Goat's beard STOP But the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she found
herself sitting quietly under a tree--while the Gnat (for that was the
insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just over
her head, and fanning her with its wings STOP It certainly was a VERY large Gnat: 'about the size of a chicken,' Alice
thought STOP Still, she couldn't feel nervous with it, after they had been
talking together so long.

 STOP --then you don't like all insects? STOP the Gnat went on, as quietly as if
nothing had happened STOP 'I like them when they can talk,' Alice said STOP 'None of them ever talk,
where _I_ come from. STOP 'What sort of insects do you rejoice in, where YOU come from? STOP the Gnat
inquired STOP 'I don't REJOICE in insects at all,' Alice explained, 'because I'm
rather afraid of them--at least the large kinds STOP But I can tell you the
names of some of them. STOP 'Of course they answer to their names? STOP the Gnat remarked carelessly STOP 'I never knew them to do it. STOP 'What's the use of their having names,' the Gnat said, 'if they won't
answer to them? STOP 'No use to THEM,' said Alice; 'but it's useful to the people who name
them, I suppose STOP If not, why do things have names at all? STOP 'I can't say,' the Gnat replied STOP 'Further on, in the wood down there,
they've got no names--however, go on with your list of insects: you're
wasting time. STOP 'Well, there's the Horse-fly,' Alice began, counting off the names on
her fingers STOP 'All right,' said the Gnat: 'half way up that bush, you'll see a
Rocking-horse-fly, if you look STOP It's made entirely of wood, and gets
about by swinging itself from branch to branch. STOP 'What does it live on? STOP Alice asked, with great curiosity STOP 'Sap and sawdust,' said the Gnat STOP 'Go on with the list. STOP Alice looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made
up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright
and sticky; and then she went on STOP 'And there's the Dragon-fly. STOP 'Look on the branch above your head,' said the Gnat, 'and there you'll
find a snap-dragon-fly STOP Its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of
holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy. STOP 'And what does it live on? STOP 'Frumenty and mince pie,' the Gnat replied; 'and it makes its nest in a
Christmas box. STOP 'And then there's the Butterfly,' Alice went on, after she had taken
a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to
herself, 'I wonder if that's the reason insects are so fond of flying
into candles--because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies! STOP 'Crawling at your feet,' said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in
some alarm), 'you may observe a Bread-and-Butterfly STOP Its wings are thin
slices of Bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump
of sugar. STOP 'And what does IT live on? STOP 'Weak tea with cream in it. STOP A new difficulty came into Alice's head STOP 'Supposing it couldn't find
any? STOP she suggested STOP 'Then it would die, of course. STOP 'But that must happen very often,' Alice remarked thoughtfully STOP 'It always happens,' said the Gnat STOP After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering STOP The Gnat
amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last
it settled again and remarked, 'I suppose you don't want to lose your
name? STOP 'No, indeed,' Alice said, a little anxiously STOP 'And yet I don't know,' the Gnat went on in a careless tone: 'only think
how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it STOP For instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons, she
would call out "come here--," and there she would have to leave off,
because there wouldn't be any name for her to call, and of course you
wouldn't have to go, you know. STOP 'That would never do, I'm sure,' said Alice: 'the governess would never
think of excusing me lessons for that STOP If she couldn't remember my name,
she'd call me "Miss! STOP as the servants do. STOP 'Well, if she said "Miss," and didn't say anything more,' the Gnat
remarked, 'of course you'd miss your lessons STOP That's a joke STOP I wish YOU
had made it. STOP 'Why do you wish _I_ had made it? STOP Alice asked STOP 'It's a very bad one. STOP But the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling down
its cheeks STOP 'You shouldn't make jokes,' Alice said, 'if it makes you so unhappy. STOP Then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the
poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when Alice
looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as
she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and
walked on STOP She very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of
it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and Alice felt a LITTLE
timid about going into it STOP However, on second thoughts, she made up her
mind to go on: 'for I certainly won't go BACK,' she thought to herself,
and this was the only way to the Eighth Square STOP 'This must be the wood,' she said thoughtfully to herself, 'where
things have no names STOP I wonder what'll become of MY name when I go in STOP I shouldn't like to lose it at all--because they'd have to give me
another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one STOP But then
the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old
name STOP That's just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose
dogs--"ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF 'DASH:' HAD ON A BRASS COLLAR"--just fancy
calling everything you met "Alice," till one of them answered STOP Only they
wouldn't answer at all, if they were wise. STOP She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked
very cool and shady STOP 'Well, at any rate it's a great comfort,' she
said as she stepped under the trees, 'after being so hot, to get into
the--into WHAT? STOP she went on, rather surprised at not being able to
think of the word STOP 'I mean to get under the--under the--under THIS, you
know! STOP putting her hand on the trunk of the tree STOP 'What DOES it call
itself, I wonder STOP I do believe it's got no name--why, to be sure it
hasn't! STOP She stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again STOP 'Then it really HAS happened, after all STOP And now, who am I STOP I WILL
remember, if I can STOP I'm determined to do it! STOP But being determined
didn't help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of puzzling,
was, 'L, I KNOW it begins with L! STOP Just then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with its large
gentle eyes, but didn't seem at all frightened STOP 'Here then STOP Here then! STOP Alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it only
started back a little, and then stood looking at her again STOP 'What do you call yourself? STOP the Fawn said at last STOP Such a soft sweet
voice it had STOP 'I wish I knew! STOP thought poor Alice STOP She answered, rather sadly,
'Nothing, just now. STOP 'Think again,' it said: 'that won't do. STOP Alice thought, but nothing came of it STOP 'Please, would you tell me
what YOU call yourself? STOP she said timidly STOP 'I think that might help a
little. STOP 'I'll tell you, if you'll move a little further on,' the Fawn said STOP 'I
can't remember here. STOP So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped
lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into
another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air,
and shook itself free from Alice's arms STOP 'I'm a Fawn! STOP it cried out in a
voice of delight, 'and, dear me STOP you're a human child! STOP A sudden look of
alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it had
darted away at full speed STOP Alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at
having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly STOP 'However, I
know my name now. STOP she said, 'that's SOME comfort STOP Alice--Alice--I won't
forget it again STOP And now, which of these finger-posts ought I to follow,
I wonder? STOP It was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one
road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it STOP 'I'll settle it,' Alice said to herself, 'when the road divides and they
point different ways. STOP But this did not seem likely to happen STOP She went on and on, a long way,
but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts
pointing the same way, one marked 'TO TWEEDLEDUM'S HOUSE' and the other
'TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE. STOP 'I do believe,' said Alice at last, 'that they live in the same house STOP I
wonder I never thought of that before--But I can't stay there long STOP I'll
just call and say "how d'you do? STOP and ask them the way out of the wood STOP If I could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark! STOP So she
wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp
corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she could not
help starting back, but in another moment she recovered herself, feeling
sure that they must be STOP  STOP Tweedledum And Tweedledee

They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other's
neck, and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them
had 'DUM' embroidered on his collar, and the other 'DEE. STOP 'I suppose
they've each got "TWEEDLE" round at the back of the collar,' she said to
herself STOP They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was
just looking round to see if the word "TWEEDLE" was written at the back
of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one
marked 'DUM. STOP 'If you think we're wax-works,' he said, 'you ought to pay, you know STOP Wax-works weren't made to be looked at for nothing, nohow! STOP 'Contrariwise,' added the one marked 'DEE,' 'if you think we're alive,
you ought to speak. STOP 'I'm sure I'm very sorry,' was all Alice could say; for the words of the
old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock, and
she could hardly help saying them out loud:--


     'Tweedledum and Tweedledee
      Agreed to have a battle;
     For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
      Had spoiled his nice new rattle STOP Just then flew down a monstrous crow,
      As black as a tar-barrel;
     Which frightened both the heroes so,
      They quite forgot their quarrel. STOP 'I know what you're thinking about,' said Tweedledum: 'but it isn't so,
nohow. STOP 'Contrariwise,' continued Tweedledee, 'if it was so, it might be; and if
it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain't STOP That's logic. STOP 'I was thinking,' Alice said very politely, 'which is the best way out
of this wood: it's getting so dark STOP Would you tell me, please? STOP But the little men only looked at each other and grinned STOP They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that Alice
couldn't help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying 'First Boy! STOP 'Nohow! STOP Tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up again with
a snap STOP 'Next Boy! STOP said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt quite
certain he would only shout out 'Contrariwise! STOP and so he did STOP 'You've been wrong! STOP cried Tweedledum STOP 'The first thing in a visit is to
say "How d'ye do? STOP and shake hands! STOP And here the two brothers gave each
other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free, to
shake hands with her STOP Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear
of hurting the other one's feelings; so, as the best way out of the
difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they
were dancing round in a ring STOP This seemed quite natural (she remembered
afterwards), and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it
seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing, and it was
done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one
across the other, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks STOP 'But it certainly WAS funny,' (Alice said afterwards, when she was
telling her sister the history of all this,) 'to find myself singing
"HERE WE GO ROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH. STOP I don't know when I began it, but
somehow I felt as if I'd been singing it a long long time! STOP The other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath STOP 'Four times
round is enough for one dance,' Tweedledum panted out, and they left
off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at the same
moment STOP Then they let go of Alice's hands, and stood looking at her for a
minute: there was a rather awkward pause, as Alice didn't know how to
begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with STOP 'It
would never do to say "How d'ye do? STOP NOW,' she said to herself: 'we seem
to have got beyond that, somehow! STOP 'I hope you're not much tired? STOP she said at last STOP 'Nohow STOP And thank you VERY much for asking,' said Tweedledum STOP 'So much obliged! STOP added Tweedledee STOP 'You like poetry? STOP 'Ye-es, pretty well--SOME poetry,' Alice said doubtfully STOP 'Would you
tell me which road leads out of the wood? STOP 'What shall I repeat to her? STOP said Tweedledee, looking round at
Tweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing Alice's question STOP '"THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER" is the longest,' Tweedledum replied,
giving his brother an affectionate hug STOP Tweedledee began instantly:

       'The sun was shining--'

Here Alice ventured to interrupt him STOP 'If it's VERY long,' she said, as
politely as she could, 'would you please tell me first which road--'

Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again:

     'The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
     He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright--
     And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night STOP The moon was shining sulkily,
      Because she thought the sun
     Had got no business to be there
      After the day was done--
     "It's very rude of him," she said,
      "To come and spoil the fun! STOP The sea was wet as wet could be,
      The sands were dry as dry STOP You could not see a cloud, because
      No cloud was in the sky:
     No birds were flying over head--
      There were no birds to fly STOP The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Were walking close at hand;
     They wept like anything to see
      Such quantities of sand:
     "If this were only cleared away,"
      They said, "it WOULD be grand! STOP "If seven maids with seven mops
      Swept it for half a year,
     Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
      "That they could get it clear? STOP "I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
      And shed a bitter tear STOP "O Oysters, come and walk with us! STOP The Walrus did beseech STOP "A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
      Along the briny beach:
     We cannot do with more than four,
      To give a hand to each. STOP The eldest Oyster looked at him STOP But never a word he said:
     The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
      And shook his heavy head--
     Meaning to say he did not choose
      To leave the oyster-bed STOP But four young oysters hurried up,
      All eager for the treat:
     Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
      Their shoes were clean and neat--
     And this was odd, because, you know,
      They hadn't any feet STOP Four other Oysters followed them,
      And yet another four;
     And thick and fast they came at last,
      And more, and more, and more--
     All hopping through the frothy waves,
      And scrambling to the shore STOP The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Walked on a mile or so,
     And then they rested on a rock
      Conveniently low:
     And all the little Oysters stood
      And waited in a row STOP "The time has come," the Walrus said,
      "To talk of many things:
     Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
      Of cabbages--and kings--
     And why the sea is boiling hot--
      And whether pigs have wings. STOP "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
      "Before we have our chat;
     For some of us are out of breath,
      And all of us are fat! STOP "No hurry! STOP said the Carpenter STOP They thanked him much for that STOP "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
      "Is what we chiefly need:
     Pepper and vinegar besides
      Are very good indeed--
     Now if you're ready Oysters dear,
      We can begin to feed. STOP "But not on us! STOP the Oysters cried,
      Turning a little blue,
     "After such kindness, that would be
      A dismal thing to do! STOP "The night is fine," the Walrus said
      "Do you admire the view STOP "It was so kind of you to come STOP And you are very nice! STOP The Carpenter said nothing but
      "Cut us another slice:
     I wish you were not quite so deaf--
      I've had to ask you twice! STOP "It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
      "To play them such a trick,
     After we've brought them out so far,
      And made them trot so quick! STOP The Carpenter said nothing but
      "The butter's spread too thick! STOP "I weep for you," the Walrus said STOP "I deeply sympathize. STOP With sobs and tears he sorted out
      Those of the largest size STOP Holding his pocket handkerchief
      Before his streaming eyes STOP "O Oysters," said the Carpenter STOP "You've had a pleasant run STOP Shall we be trotting home again? STOP But answer came there none--
     And that was scarcely odd, because
      They'd eaten every one. STOP 'I like the Walrus best,' said Alice: 'because you see he was a LITTLE
sorry for the poor oysters. STOP 'He ate more than the Carpenter, though,' said Tweedledee STOP 'You see he
held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter couldn't count how
many he took: contrariwise. STOP 'That was mean! STOP Alice said indignantly STOP 'Then I like the Carpenter
best--if he didn't eat so many as the Walrus. STOP 'But he ate as many as he could get,' said Tweedledum STOP This was a puzzler STOP After a pause, Alice began, 'Well STOP They were BOTH
very unpleasant characters--' Here she checked herself in some alarm,
at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large
steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likely
to be a wild beast STOP 'Are there any lions or tigers about here? STOP she
asked timidly STOP 'It's only the Red King snoring,' said Tweedledee STOP 'Come and look at him! STOP the brothers cried, and they each took one of
Alice's hands, and led her up to where the King was sleeping STOP 'Isn't he a LOVELY sight? STOP said Tweedledum STOP Alice couldn't say honestly that he was STOP He had a tall red night-cap on,
with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap,
and snoring loud--'fit to snore his head off! STOP as Tweedledum remarked STOP 'I'm afraid he'll catch cold with lying on the damp grass,' said Alice,
who was a very thoughtful little girl STOP 'He's dreaming now,' said Tweedledee: 'and what do you think he's
dreaming about? STOP Alice said 'Nobody can guess that. STOP 'Why, about YOU! STOP Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands triumphantly STOP 'And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be? STOP 'Where I am now, of course,' said Alice STOP 'Not you! STOP Tweedledee retorted contemptuously STOP 'You'd be nowhere STOP Why,
you're only a sort of thing in his dream! STOP 'If that there King was to wake,' added Tweedledum, 'you'd go
out--bang!--just like a candle! STOP 'I shouldn't! STOP Alice exclaimed indignantly STOP 'Besides, if I'M only a sort
of thing in his dream, what are YOU, I should like to know? STOP 'Ditto' said Tweedledum STOP 'Ditto, ditto' cried Tweedledee STOP He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn't help saying, 'Hush STOP You'll
be waking him, I'm afraid, if you make so much noise. STOP 'Well, it no use YOUR talking about waking him,' said Tweedledum, 'when
you're only one of the things in his dream STOP You know very well you're
not real. STOP 'I AM real! STOP said Alice and began to cry STOP 'You won't make yourself a bit realler by crying,' Tweedledee remarked:
'there's nothing to cry about. STOP 'If I wasn't real,' Alice said--half-laughing through her tears, it all
seemed so ridiculous--'I shouldn't be able to cry. STOP 'I hope you don't suppose those are real tears? STOP Tweedledum interrupted
in a tone of great contempt STOP 'I know they're talking nonsense,' Alice thought to herself: 'and it's
foolish to cry about it. STOP So she brushed away her tears, and went on as
cheerfully as she could STOP 'At any rate I'd better be getting out of the
wood, for really it's coming on very dark STOP Do you think it's going to
rain? STOP Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and
looked up into it STOP 'No, I don't think it is,' he said: 'at least--not
under HERE STOP Nohow. STOP 'But it may rain OUTSIDE? STOP 'It may--if it chooses,' said Tweedledee: 'we've no objection STOP Contrariwise. STOP 'Selfish things! STOP thought Alice, and she was just going to say
'Good-night' and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from under the
umbrella and seized her by the wrist STOP 'Do you see THAT? STOP he said, in a voice choking with passion, and
his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with a
trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree STOP 'It's only a rattle,' Alice said, after a careful examination of the
little white thing STOP 'Not a rattleSNAKE, you know,' she added hastily,
thinking that he was frightened: 'only an old rattle--quite old and
broken. STOP 'I knew it was! STOP cried Tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly and
tear his hair STOP 'It's spoilt, of course! STOP Here he looked at Tweedledee,
who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under
the umbrella STOP Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, 'You
needn't be so angry about an old rattle. STOP 'But it isn't old! STOP Tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than ever STOP 'It's
new, I tell you--I bought it yesterday--my nice new RATTLE! STOP and his
voice rose to a perfect scream STOP All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella,
with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it
quite took off Alice's attention from the angry brother STOP But he couldn't
quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the
umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting
his mouth and his large eyes--'looking more like a fish than anything
else,' Alice thought STOP 'Of course you agree to have a battle? STOP Tweedledum said in a calmer
tone STOP 'I suppose so,' the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the
umbrella: 'only SHE must help us to dress up, you know. STOP So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned
in a minute with their arms full of things--such as bolsters, blankets,
hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles STOP 'I hope you're
a good hand at pinning and tying strings? STOP Tweedledum remarked STOP 'Every
one of these things has got to go on, somehow or other. STOP Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything
in all her life--the way those two bustled about--and the quantity of
things they put on--and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and
fastening buttons--'Really they'll be more like bundles of old clothes
than anything else, by the time they're ready! STOP she said to herself, as
she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee, 'to keep his head
from being cut off,' as he said STOP 'You know,' he added very gravely, 'it's one of the most serious things
that can possibly happen to one in a battle--to get one's head cut off. STOP Alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear
of hurting his feelings STOP 'Do I look very pale? STOP said Tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet
tied on STOP (He CALLED it a helmet, though it certainly looked much more
like a saucepan. STOP 'Well--yes--a LITTLE,' Alice replied gently STOP 'I'm very brave generally,' he went on in a low voice: 'only to-day I
happen to have a headache. STOP 'And I'VE got a toothache! STOP said Tweedledee, who had overheard the
remark STOP 'I'm far worse off than you! STOP 'Then you'd better not fight to-day,' said Alice, thinking it a good
opportunity to make peace STOP 'We MUST have a bit of a fight, but I don't care about going on long,'
said Tweedledum STOP 'What's the time now? STOP Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said 'Half-past four. STOP 'Let's fight till six, and then have dinner,' said Tweedledum STOP 'Very well,' the other said, rather sadly: 'and SHE can watch us--only
you'd better not come VERY close,' he added: 'I generally hit everything
I can see--when I get really excited. STOP 'And _I_ hit everything within reach,' cried Tweedledum, 'whether I can
see it or not! STOP Alice laughed STOP 'You must hit the TREES pretty often, I should think,'
she said STOP Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile STOP 'I don't suppose,'
he said, 'there'll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, by
the time we've finished! STOP 'And all about a rattle! STOP said Alice, still hoping to make them a LITTLE
ashamed of fighting for such a trifle STOP 'I shouldn't have minded it so much,' said Tweedledum, 'if it hadn't
been a new one. STOP 'I wish the monstrous crow would come! STOP thought Alice STOP 'There's only one sword, you know,' Tweedledum said to his brother:
'but you can have the umbrella--it's quite as sharp STOP Only we must begin
quick STOP It's getting as dark as it can. STOP 'And darker,' said Tweedledee STOP It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be a
thunderstorm coming on STOP 'What a thick black cloud that is! STOP she said STOP 'And how fast it comes STOP Why, I do believe it's got wings! STOP 'It's the crow! STOP Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and
the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment STOP Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree STOP 'It can never get at me HERE,' she thought: 'it's far too large to
squeeze itself in among the trees STOP But I wish it wouldn't flap its wings
so--it makes quite a hurricane in the wood--here's somebody's shawl
being blown away! STOP  STOP Wool and Water

She caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in
another moment the White Queen came running wildly through the wood,
with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and Alice very
civilly went to meet her with the shawl STOP 'I'm very glad I happened to be in the way,' Alice said, as she helped
her to put on her shawl again STOP The White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way,
and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like
'bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter,' and Alice felt that if there was
to be any conversation at all, she must manage it herself STOP So she began
rather timidly: 'Am I addressing the White Queen? STOP 'Well, yes, if you call that a-dressing,' The Queen said STOP 'It isn't MY
notion of the thing, at all. STOP Alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very
beginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said, 'If your
Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I'll do it as well as
I can. STOP 'But I don't want it done at all! STOP groaned the poor Queen STOP 'I've been
a-dressing myself for the last two hours. STOP It would have been all the better, as it seemed to Alice, if she had got
some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy STOP 'Every
single thing's crooked,' Alice thought to herself, 'and she's all over
pins!--may I put your shawl straight for you? STOP she added aloud STOP 'I don't know what's the matter with it! STOP the Queen said, in a
melancholy voice STOP 'It's out of temper, I think STOP I've pinned it here, and
I've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it! STOP 'It CAN'T go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side,' Alice
said, as she gently put it right for her; 'and, dear me, what a state
your hair is in! STOP 'The brush has got entangled in it! STOP the Queen said with a sigh STOP 'And I
lost the comb yesterday. STOP Alice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the hair
into order STOP 'Come, you look rather better now! STOP she said, after altering
most of the pins STOP 'But really you should have a lady's maid! STOP 'I'm sure I'll take you with pleasure! STOP the Queen said STOP 'Twopence a
week, and jam every other day. STOP Alice couldn't help laughing, as she said, 'I don't want you to hire
ME--and I don't care for jam. STOP 'It's very good jam,' said the Queen STOP 'Well, I don't want any TO-DAY, at any rate. STOP 'You couldn't have it if you DID want it,' the Queen said STOP 'The rule is,
jam to-morrow and jam yesterday--but never jam to-day. STOP 'It MUST come sometimes to "jam to-day,"' Alice objected STOP 'No, it can't,' said the Queen STOP 'It's jam every OTHER day: to-day isn't
any OTHER day, you know. STOP 'I don't understand you,' said Alice STOP 'It's dreadfully confusing! STOP 'That's the effect of living backwards,' the Queen said kindly: 'it
always makes one a little giddy at first--'

'Living backwards! STOP Alice repeated in great astonishment STOP 'I never heard
of such a thing! STOP '--but there's one great advantage in it, that one's memory works both
ways. STOP 'I'm sure MINE only works one way,' Alice remarked STOP 'I can't remember
things before they happen. STOP 'It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,' the Queen
remarked STOP 'What sort of things do YOU remember best? STOP Alice ventured to ask STOP 'Oh, things that happened the week after next,' the Queen replied in a
careless tone STOP 'For instance, now,' she went on, sticking a large piece
of plaster [band-aid] on her finger as she spoke, 'there's the King's
Messenger STOP He's in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn't
even begin till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of
all. STOP 'Suppose he never commits the crime? STOP said Alice STOP 'That would be all the better, wouldn't it? STOP the Queen said, as she
bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon STOP Alice felt there was no denying THAT STOP 'Of course it would be all
the better,' she said: 'but it wouldn't be all the better his being
punished. STOP 'You're wrong THERE, at any rate,' said the Queen: 'were YOU ever
punished? STOP 'Only for faults,' said Alice STOP 'And you were all the better for it, I know! STOP the Queen said
triumphantly STOP 'Yes, but then I HAD done the things I was punished for,' said Alice:
'that makes all the difference. STOP 'But if you HADN'T done them,' the Queen said, 'that would have been
better still; better, and better, and better! STOP Her voice went higher
with each 'better,' till it got quite to a squeak at last STOP Alice was just beginning to say 'There's a mistake somewhere--,' when
the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence
unfinished STOP 'Oh, oh, oh! STOP shouted the Queen, shaking her hand about as
if she wanted to shake it off STOP 'My finger's bleeding STOP Oh, oh, oh, oh! STOP Her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that
Alice had to hold both her hands over her ears STOP 'What IS the matter? STOP she said, as soon as there was a chance of making
herself heard STOP 'Have you pricked your finger? STOP 'I haven't pricked it YET,' the Queen said, 'but I soon shall--oh, oh,
oh! STOP 'When do you expect to do it? STOP Alice asked, feeling very much inclined
to laugh STOP 'When I fasten my shawl again,' the poor Queen groaned out: 'the brooch
will come undone directly STOP Oh, oh! STOP As she said the words the brooch
flew open, and the Queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp it
again STOP 'Take care! STOP cried Alice STOP 'You're holding it all crooked! STOP And she
caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and the
Queen had pricked her finger STOP 'That accounts for the bleeding, you see,' she said to Alice with a
smile STOP 'Now you understand the way things happen here. STOP 'But why don't you scream now? STOP Alice asked, holding her hands ready to
put over her ears again STOP 'Why, I've done all the screaming already,' said the Queen STOP 'What would
be the good of having it all over again? STOP By this time it was getting light STOP 'The crow must have flown away, I
think,' said Alice: 'I'm so glad it's gone STOP I thought it was the night
coming on. STOP 'I wish _I_ could manage to be glad! STOP the Queen said STOP 'Only I never
can remember the rule STOP You must be very happy, living in this wood, and
being glad whenever you like! STOP 'Only it is so VERY lonely here! STOP Alice said in a melancholy voice; and
at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her
cheeks STOP 'Oh, don't go on like that! STOP cried the poor Queen, wringing her hands in
despair STOP 'Consider what a great girl you are STOP Consider what a long way
you've come to-day STOP Consider what o'clock it is STOP Consider anything, only
don't cry! STOP Alice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears STOP 'Can YOU keep from crying by considering things? STOP she asked STOP 'That's the way it's done,' the Queen said with great decision: 'nobody
can do two things at once, you know STOP Let's consider your age to begin
with--how old are you? STOP 'I'm seven and a half exactly. STOP 'You needn't say "exactually,"' the Queen remarked: 'I can believe
it without that STOP Now I'll give YOU something to believe STOP I'm just one
hundred and one, five months and a day. STOP 'I can't believe THAT! STOP said Alice STOP 'Can't you? STOP the Queen said in a pitying tone STOP 'Try again: draw a long
breath, and shut your eyes. STOP Alice laughed STOP 'There's no use trying,' she said: 'one CAN'T believe
impossible things. STOP 'I daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen STOP 'When I was
your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day STOP Why, sometimes I've
believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast STOP There goes
the shawl again! STOP The brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew
the Queen's shawl across a little brook STOP The Queen spread out her arms
again, and went flying after it, and this time she succeeded in catching
it for herself STOP 'I've got it! STOP she cried in a triumphant tone STOP 'Now you
shall see me pin it on again, all by myself! STOP 'Then I hope your finger is better now? STOP Alice said very politely, as
she crossed the little brook after the Queen STOP 'Oh, much better! STOP cried the Queen, her voice rising to a squeak as she
went on STOP 'Much be-etter STOP Be-etter STOP Be-e-e-etter STOP Be-e-ehh! STOP The last
word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that Alice quite started STOP She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up
in wool STOP Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again STOP She couldn't make out
what had happened at all STOP Was she in a shop STOP And was that really--was it
really a SHEEP that was sitting on the other side of the counter STOP Rub as
she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark
shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was
an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and then
leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles STOP 'What is it you want to buy? STOP the Sheep said at last, looking up for a
moment from her knitting STOP 'I don't QUITE know yet,' Alice said, very gently STOP 'I should like to
look all round me first, if I might. STOP 'You may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,' said the
Sheep: 'but you can't look ALL round you--unless you've got eyes at the
back of your head. STOP But these, as it happened, Alice had NOT got: so she contented herself
with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them STOP The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things--but the
oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf,
to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always
quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they
could hold STOP 'Things flow about so here! STOP she said at last in a plaintive tone, after
she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing,
that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box, and was
always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at STOP 'And this one
is the most provoking of all--but I'll tell you what--' she added, as a
sudden thought struck her, 'I'll follow it up to the very top shelf of
all STOP It'll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, I expect! STOP But even this plan failed: the 'thing' went through the ceiling as
quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it STOP 'Are you a child or a teetotum? STOP the Sheep said, as she took up another
pair of needles STOP 'You'll make me giddy soon, if you go on turning round
like that. STOP She was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and Alice
couldn't help looking at her in great astonishment STOP 'How CAN she knit with so many? STOP the puzzled child thought to herself STOP 'She gets more and more like a porcupine every minute! STOP 'Can you row? STOP the Sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles
as she spoke STOP 'Yes, a little--but not on land--and not with needles--' Alice was
beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her
hands, and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between
banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best STOP 'Feather! STOP cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles STOP This didn't sound like a remark that needed any answer, so Alice said
nothing, but pulled away STOP There was something very queer about the
water, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and
would hardly come out again STOP 'Feather STOP Feather! STOP the Sheep cried again, taking more needles STOP 'You'll
be catching a crab directly. STOP 'A dear little crab! STOP thought Alice STOP 'I should like that. STOP 'Didn't you hear me say "Feather"? STOP the Sheep cried angrily, taking up
quite a bunch of needles STOP 'Indeed I did,' said Alice: 'you've said it very often--and very loud STOP Please, where ARE the crabs? STOP 'In the water, of course! STOP said the Sheep, sticking some of the needles
into her hair, as her hands were full STOP 'Feather, I say! STOP 'WHY do you say "feather" so often? STOP Alice asked at last, rather vexed STOP 'I'm not a bird! STOP 'You are,' said the Sheep: 'you're a little goose. STOP This offended Alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a
minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of
weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever),
and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks
frowning over their heads STOP 'Oh, please STOP There are some scented rushes! STOP Alice cried in a sudden
transport of delight STOP 'There really are--and SUCH beauties! STOP 'You needn't say "please" to ME about 'em,' the Sheep said, without
looking up from her knitting: 'I didn't put 'em there, and I'm not going
to take 'em away. STOP 'No, but I meant--please, may we wait and pick some? STOP Alice pleaded STOP 'If
you don't mind stopping the boat for a minute. STOP 'How am _I_ to stop it? STOP said the Sheep STOP 'If you leave off rowing, it'll
stop of itself. STOP So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it
glided gently in among the waving rushes STOP And then the little sleeves
were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep
to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off--and for
a while Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting, as she
bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair
dipping into the water--while with bright eager eyes she caught at one
bunch after another of the darling scented rushes STOP 'I only hope the boat won't tipple over! STOP she said to herself STOP 'Oh, WHAT
a lovely one STOP Only I couldn't quite reach it. STOP 'And it certainly DID
seem a little provoking ('almost as if it happened on purpose,' she
thought) that, though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as
the boat glided by, there was always a more lovely one that she couldn't
reach STOP 'The prettiest are always further! STOP she said at last, with a sigh at the
obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed cheeks
and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place, and
began to arrange her new-found treasures STOP What mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade, and
to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that she
picked them STOP Even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very little
while--and these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like snow, as
they lay in heaps at her feet--but Alice hardly noticed this, there were
so many other curious things to think about STOP They hadn't gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got
fast in the water and WOULDN'T come out again (so Alice explained it
afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her
under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of 'Oh, oh,
oh! STOP from poor Alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among
the heap of rushes STOP However, she wasn't hurt, and was soon up again: the Sheep went on with
her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened STOP 'That was
a nice crab you caught! STOP she remarked, as Alice got back into her place,
very much relieved to find herself still in the boat STOP 'Was it STOP I didn't see it,' Said Alice, peeping cautiously over the side
of the boat into the dark water STOP 'I wish it hadn't let go--I should
so like to see a little crab to take home with me! STOP But the Sheep only
laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting STOP 'Are there many crabs here? STOP said Alice STOP 'Crabs, and all sorts of things,' said the Sheep: 'plenty of choice,
only make up your mind STOP Now, what DO you want to buy? STOP 'To buy! STOP Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half
frightened--for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all
in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop STOP 'I should like to buy an egg, please,' she said timidly STOP 'How do you
sell them? STOP 'Fivepence farthing for one--Twopence for two,' the Sheep replied STOP 'Then two are cheaper than one? STOP Alice said in a surprised tone, taking
out her purse STOP 'Only you MUST eat them both, if you buy two,' said the Sheep STOP 'Then I'll have ONE, please,' said Alice, as she put the money down on
the counter STOP For she thought to herself, 'They mightn't be at all nice,
you know. STOP The Sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said 'I
never put things into people's hands--that would never do--you must get
it for yourself. STOP And so saying, she went off to the other end of the
shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf STOP 'I wonder WHY it wouldn't do? STOP thought Alice, as she groped her way
among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards the end STOP 'The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it STOP Let me
see, is this a chair STOP Why, it's got branches, I declare STOP How very odd to
find trees growing here STOP And actually here's a little brook STOP Well, this
is the very queerest shop I ever saw! STOP So she went on, wondering more and more at every step, as everything
turned into a tree the moment she came up to it, and she quite expected
the egg to do the same STOP  STOP Humpty Dumpty

However, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and more human:
when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had eyes
and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to it, she saw clearly
that it was HUMPTY DUMPTY himself STOP 'It can't be anybody else! STOP she said
to herself STOP 'I'm as certain of it, as if his name were written all over
his face. STOP It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous
face STOP Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on
the top of a high wall--such a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how
he could keep his balance--and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the
opposite direction, and he didn't take the least notice of her, she
thought he must be a stuffed figure after all STOP 'And how exactly like an egg he is! STOP she said aloud, standing with her
hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to
fall STOP 'It's VERY provoking,' Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence, looking
away from Alice as he spoke, 'to be called an egg--VERY! STOP 'I said you LOOKED like an egg, Sir,' Alice gently explained STOP 'And some
eggs are very pretty, you know' she added, hoping to turn her remark
into a sort of a compliment STOP 'Some people,' said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her as usual, 'have
no more sense than a baby! STOP Alice didn't know what to say to this: it wasn't at all like
conversation, she thought, as he never said anything to HER; in fact,
his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree--so she stood and
softly repeated to herself:--


     'Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:
     Humpty Dumpty had a great fall STOP All the King's horses and all the King's men
     Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty in his place again. STOP 'That last line is much too long for the poetry,' she added, almost out
loud, forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her STOP 'Don't stand there chattering to yourself like that,' Humpty Dumpty
said, looking at her for the first time, 'but tell me your name and your
business. STOP 'My NAME is Alice, but--'

'It's a stupid enough name! STOP Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently STOP 'What does it mean? STOP 'MUST a name mean something? STOP Alice asked doubtfully STOP 'Of course it must,' Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh: 'MY name
means the shape I am--and a good handsome shape it is, too STOP With a name
like yours, you might be any shape, almost. STOP 'Why do you sit out here all alone? STOP said Alice, not wishing to begin an
argument STOP 'Why, because there's nobody with me! STOP cried Humpty Dumpty STOP 'Did you
think I didn't know the answer to THAT STOP Ask another. STOP 'Don't you think you'd be safer down on the ground? STOP Alice went on, not
with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured
anxiety for the queer creature STOP 'That wall is so VERY narrow! STOP 'What tremendously easy riddles you ask! STOP Humpty Dumpty growled out STOP 'Of
course I don't think so STOP Why, if ever I DID fall off--which there's no
chance of--but IF I did--' Here he pursed up his lips and looked so solemn
and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing STOP 'IF I did fall,' he
went on, 'THE KING HAS PROMISED ME--ah, you may turn pale, if you like STOP You didn't think I was going to say that, did you STOP THE KING HAS PROMISED ME--
WITH HIS VERY OWN MOUTH--to--to--'

'To send all his horses and all his men,' Alice interrupted, rather
unwisely STOP 'Now I declare that's too bad! STOP Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking into a
sudden passion STOP 'You've been listening at doors--and behind trees--and
down chimneys--or you couldn't have known it! STOP 'I haven't, indeed! STOP Alice said very gently STOP 'It's in a book. STOP 'Ah, well STOP They may write such things in a BOOK,' Humpty Dumpty said in
a calmer tone STOP 'That's what you call a History of England, that is STOP Now, take a good look at me STOP I'm one that has spoken to a King, _I_ am:
mayhap you'll never see such another: and to show you I'm not proud, you
may shake hands with me! STOP And he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he
leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so)
and offered Alice his hand STOP She watched him a little anxiously as she
took it STOP 'If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet
behind,' she thought: 'and then I don't know what would happen to his
head STOP I'm afraid it would come off! STOP 'Yes, all his horses and all his men,' Humpty Dumpty went on STOP 'They'd
pick me up again in a minute, THEY would STOP However, this conversation is
going on a little too fast: let's go back to the last remark but one. STOP 'I'm afraid I can't quite remember it,' Alice said very politely STOP 'In that case we start fresh,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'and it's my turn
to choose a subject--' ('He talks about it just as if it was a game! STOP thought Alice. STOP 'So here's a question for you STOP How old did you say you
were? STOP Alice made a short calculation, and said 'Seven years and six months. STOP 'Wrong! STOP Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly STOP 'You never said a word
like it! STOP 'I though you meant "How old ARE you?" STOP Alice explained STOP 'If I'd meant that, I'd have said it,' said Humpty Dumpty STOP Alice didn't want to begin another argument, so she said nothing STOP 'Seven years and six months! STOP Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully STOP 'An
uncomfortable sort of age STOP Now if you'd asked MY advice, I'd have said
"Leave off at seven"--but it's too late now. STOP 'I never ask advice about growing,' Alice said indignantly STOP 'Too proud? STOP the other inquired STOP Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion STOP 'I mean,' she said,
'that one can't help growing older. STOP 'ONE can't, perhaps,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'but TWO can STOP With proper
assistance, you might have left off at seven. STOP 'What a beautiful belt you've got on! STOP Alice suddenly remarked STOP (They had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if
they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn
now. STOP 'At least,' she corrected herself on second thoughts, 'a beautiful
cravat, I should have said--no, a belt, I mean--I beg your pardon! STOP she
added in dismay, for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly offended, and she
began to wish she hadn't chosen that subject STOP 'If I only knew,' she
thought to herself, 'which was neck and which was waist! STOP Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a
minute or two STOP When he DID speak again, it was in a deep growl STOP 'It is a--MOST--PROVOKING--thing,' he said at last, 'when a person
doesn't know a cravat from a belt! STOP 'I know it's very ignorant of me,' Alice said, in so humble a tone that
Humpty Dumpty relented STOP 'It's a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say STOP It's a present
from the White King and Queen STOP There now! STOP 'Is it really? STOP said Alice, quite pleased to find that she HAD chosen a
good subject, after all STOP 'They gave it me,' Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed
one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, 'they gave it
me--for an un-birthday present. STOP 'I beg your pardon? STOP Alice said with a puzzled air STOP 'I'm not offended,' said Humpty Dumpty STOP 'I mean, what IS an un-birthday present? STOP 'A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course. STOP Alice considered a little STOP 'I like birthday presents best,' she said at
last STOP 'You don't know what you're talking about! STOP cried Humpty Dumpty STOP 'How
many days are there in a year? STOP 'Three hundred and sixty-five,' said Alice STOP 'And how many birthdays have you? STOP 'One. STOP 'And if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what remains? STOP 'Three hundred and sixty-four, of course. STOP Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful STOP 'I'd rather see that done on paper,' he
said STOP Alice couldn't help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and
worked the sum for him:


               365
                1
               ____

               364
               ___

Humpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully STOP 'That seems to
be done right--' he began STOP 'You're holding it upside down! STOP Alice interrupted STOP 'To be sure I was! STOP Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned it round for
him STOP 'I thought it looked a little queer STOP As I was saying, that SEEMS
to be done right--though I haven't time to look it over thoroughly just
now--and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four days
when you might get un-birthday presents--'

'Certainly,' said Alice STOP 'And only ONE for birthday presents, you know STOP There's glory for you! STOP 'I don't know what you mean by "glory,"' Alice said STOP Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously STOP 'Of course you don't--till I tell
you STOP I meant "there's a nice knock-down argument for you!" STOP 'But "glory" doesn't mean "a nice knock-down argument,"' Alice objected STOP 'When _I_ use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, 'it
means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less. STOP 'The question is,' said Alice, 'whether you CAN make words mean so many
different things. STOP 'The question is,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'which is to be master--that's
all. STOP Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty
Dumpty began again STOP 'They've a temper, some of them--particularly verbs,
they're the proudest--adjectives you can do anything with, but not
verbs--however, _I_ can manage the whole lot of them STOP Impenetrability STOP That's what _I_ say! STOP 'Would you tell me, please,' said Alice 'what that means? STOP 'Now you talk like a reasonable child,' said Humpty Dumpty, looking very
much pleased STOP 'I meant by "impenetrability" that we've had enough of
that subject, and it would be just as well if you'd mention what you
mean to do next, as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest
of your life. STOP 'That's a great deal to make one word mean,' Alice said in a thoughtful
tone STOP 'When I make a word do a lot of work like that,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'I
always pay it extra. STOP 'Oh! STOP said Alice STOP She was too much puzzled to make any other remark STOP 'Ah, you should see 'em come round me of a Saturday night,' Humpty
Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: 'for to get
their wages, you know. STOP (Alice didn't venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see I
can't tell YOU. STOP 'You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,' said Alice STOP 'Would you
kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called "Jabberwocky"? STOP 'Let's hear it,' said Humpty Dumpty STOP 'I can explain all the poems that
were ever invented--and a good many that haven't been invented just
yet. STOP This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse:

     'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe STOP 'That's enough to begin with,' Humpty Dumpty interrupted: 'there
are plenty of hard words there STOP "BRILLIG" means four o'clock in the
afternoon--the time when you begin BROILING things for dinner. STOP 'That'll do very well,' said Alice: 'and "SLITHY"? STOP 'Well, "SLITHY" means "lithe and slimy. STOP "Lithe" is the same as
"active. STOP You see it's like a portmanteau--there are two meanings packed
up into one word. STOP 'I see it now,' Alice remarked thoughtfully: 'and what are "TOVES"? STOP 'Well, "TOVES" are something like badgers--they're something like
lizards--and they're something like corkscrews. STOP 'They must be very curious looking creatures. STOP 'They are that,' said Humpty Dumpty: 'also they make their nests under
sun-dials--also they live on cheese. STOP 'And what's the "GYRE" and to "GIMBLE"? STOP 'To "GYRE" is to go round and round like a gyroscope STOP To "GIMBLE" is to
make holes like a gimlet. STOP 'And "THE WABE" is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I suppose? STOP said
Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity STOP 'Of course it is STOP It's called "WABE," you know, because it goes a long
way before it, and a long way behind it--'

'And a long way beyond it on each side,' Alice added STOP 'Exactly so STOP Well, then, "MIMSY" is "flimsy and miserable" (there's
another portmanteau for you) STOP And a "BOROGOVE" is a thin shabby-looking
bird with its feathers sticking out all round--something like a live
mop. STOP 'And then "MOME RATHS"? STOP said Alice STOP 'I'm afraid I'm giving you a great
deal of trouble. STOP 'Well, a "RATH" is a sort of green pig: but "MOME" I'm not certain
about STOP I think it's short for "from home"--meaning that they'd lost
their way, you know. STOP 'And what does "OUTGRABE" mean? STOP 'Well, "OUTGRABING" is something between bellowing and whistling, with a
kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you'll hear it done, maybe--down
in the wood yonder--and when you've once heard it you'll be QUITE
content STOP Who's been repeating all that hard stuff to you? STOP 'I read it in a book,' said Alice STOP 'But I had some poetry repeated to
me, much easier than that, by--Tweedledee, I think it was. STOP 'As to poetry, you know,' said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out one of his
great hands, '_I_ can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes
to that--'

'Oh, it needn't come to that! STOP Alice hastily said, hoping to keep him
from beginning STOP 'The piece I'm going to repeat,' he went on without noticing her remark,
'was written entirely for your amusement. STOP Alice felt that in that case she really OUGHT to listen to it, so she
sat down, and said 'Thank you' rather sadly STOP 'In winter, when the fields are white,
     I sing this song for your delight--


only I don't sing it,' he added, as an explanation STOP 'I see you don't,' said Alice STOP 'If you can SEE whether I'm singing or not, you've sharper eyes than
most. STOP Humpty Dumpty remarked severely STOP Alice was silent STOP 'In spring, when woods are getting green,
     I'll try and tell you what I mean. STOP 'Thank you very much,' said Alice STOP 'In summer, when the days are long,
     Perhaps you'll understand the song:
     In autumn, when the leaves are brown,
     Take pen and ink, and write it down. STOP 'I will, if I can remember it so long,' said Alice STOP 'You needn't go on making remarks like that,' Humpty Dumpty said:
'they're not sensible, and they put me out. STOP 'I sent a message to the fish:
     I told them "This is what I wish. STOP The little fishes of the sea,
     They sent an answer back to me STOP The little fishes' answer was
     "We cannot do it, Sir, because--"'


'I'm afraid I don't quite understand,' said Alice STOP 'It gets easier further on,' Humpty Dumpty replied STOP 'I sent to them again to say
     "It will be better to obey. STOP The fishes answered with a grin,
     "Why, what a temper you are in! STOP I told them once, I told them twice:
     They would not listen to advice STOP I took a kettle large and new,
     Fit for the deed I had to do STOP My heart went hop, my heart went thump;
     I filled the kettle at the pump STOP Then some one came to me and said,
     "The little fishes are in bed. STOP I said to him, I said it plain,
     "Then you must wake them up again. STOP I said it very loud and clear;
     I went and shouted in his ear. STOP Humpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this
verse, and Alice thought with a shudder, 'I wouldn't have been the
messenger for ANYTHING! STOP 'But he was very stiff and proud;
     He said "You needn't shout so loud! STOP And he was very proud and stiff;
     He said "I'd go and wake them, if--"

     I took a corkscrew from the shelf:
     I went to wake them up myself STOP And when I found the door was locked,
     I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked STOP And when I found the door was shut,
     I tried to turn the handle, but--'


There was a long pause STOP 'Is that all? STOP Alice timidly asked STOP 'That's all,' said Humpty Dumpty STOP 'Good-bye. STOP This was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after such a VERY strong
hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil
to stay STOP So she got up, and held out her hand STOP 'Good-bye, till we meet
again! STOP she said as cheerfully as she could STOP 'I shouldn't know you again if we DID meet,' Humpty Dumpty replied in
a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake; 'you're so
exactly like other people. STOP 'The face is what one goes by, generally,' Alice remarked in a
thoughtful tone STOP 'That's just what I complain of,' said Humpty Dumpty STOP 'Your face is the
same as everybody has--the two eyes, so--' (marking their places in the
air with this thumb) 'nose in the middle, mouth under STOP It's always the
same STOP Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for
instance--or the mouth at the top--that would be SOME help. STOP 'It wouldn't look nice,' Alice objected STOP But Humpty Dumpty only shut his
eyes and said 'Wait till you've tried. STOP Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never
opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said 'Good-bye! STOP once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away:
but she couldn't help saying to herself as she went, 'Of all the
unsatisfactory--' (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to
have such a long word to say) 'of all the unsatisfactory people I EVER
met--' She never finished the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash
shook the forest from end to end STOP  STOP The Lion and the Unicorn

The next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in twos
and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such crowds that
they seemed to fill the whole forest STOP Alice got behind a tree, for fear
of being run over, and watched them go by STOP She thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so
uncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something or
other, and whenever one went down, several more always fell over him, so
that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men STOP Then came the horses STOP Having four feet, these managed rather better than
the foot-soldiers: but even THEY stumbled now and then; and it seemed
to be a regular rule that, whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off
instantly STOP The confusion got worse every moment, and Alice was very glad
to get out of the wood into an open place, where she found the White
King seated on the ground, busily writing in his memorandum-book STOP 'I've sent them all! STOP the King cried in a tone of delight, on seeing
Alice STOP 'Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came
through the wood? STOP 'Yes, I did,' said Alice: 'several thousand, I should think. STOP 'Four thousand two hundred and seven, that's the exact number,' the King
said, referring to his book STOP 'I couldn't send all the horses, you know,
because two of them are wanted in the game STOP And I haven't sent the two
Messengers, either STOP They're both gone to the town STOP Just look along the
road, and tell me if you can see either of them. STOP 'I see nobody on the road,' said Alice STOP 'I only wish _I_ had such eyes,' the King remarked in a fretful tone STOP 'To be able to see Nobody STOP And at that distance, too STOP Why, it's as much
as _I_ can do to see real people, by this light! STOP All this was lost on Alice, who was still looking intently along
the road, shading her eyes with one hand STOP 'I see somebody now! STOP she
exclaimed at last STOP 'But he's coming very slowly--and what curious
attitudes he goes into! STOP (For the messenger kept skipping up and down,
and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands spread
out like fans on each side. STOP 'Not at all,' said the King STOP 'He's an Anglo-Saxon Messenger--and those
are Anglo-Saxon attitudes STOP He only does them when he's happy STOP His name
is Haigha. STOP (He pronounced it so as to rhyme with 'mayor.' STOP 'I love my love with an H,' Alice couldn't help beginning, 'because
he is Happy STOP I hate him with an H, because he is Hideous STOP I fed him
with--with--with Ham-sandwiches and Hay STOP His name is Haigha, and he
lives--'

'He lives on the Hill,' the King remarked simply, without the least idea
that he was joining in the game, while Alice was still hesitating for
the name of a town beginning with H. 'The other Messenger's called
Hatta STOP I must have TWO, you know--to come and go STOP One to come, and one
to go. STOP 'I beg your pardon? STOP said Alice STOP 'It isn't respectable to beg,' said the King STOP 'I only meant that I didn't understand,' said Alice STOP 'Why one to come
and one to go? STOP 'Didn't I tell you? STOP the King repeated impatiently STOP 'I must have Two--to
fetch and carry STOP One to fetch, and one to carry. STOP At this moment the Messenger arrived: he was far too much out of breath
to say a word, and could only wave his hands about, and make the most
fearful faces at the poor King STOP 'This young lady loves you with an H,' the King said, introducing Alice
in the hope of turning off the Messenger's attention from himself--but
it was no use--the Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary
every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side STOP 'You alarm me! STOP said the King STOP 'I feel faint--Give me a ham sandwich! STOP On which the Messenger, to Alice's great amusement, opened a bag that
hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the King, who devoured it
greedily STOP 'Another sandwich! STOP said the King STOP 'There's nothing but hay left now,' the Messenger said, peeping into the
bag STOP 'Hay, then,' the King murmured in a faint whisper STOP Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal STOP 'There's nothing
like eating hay when you're faint,' he remarked to her, as he munched
away STOP 'I should think throwing cold water over you would be better,' Alice
suggested: 'or some sal-volatile. STOP 'I didn't say there was nothing BETTER,' the King replied STOP 'I said there
was nothing LIKE it. STOP Which Alice did not venture to deny STOP 'Who did you pass on the road? STOP the King went on, holding out his hand
to the Messenger for some more hay STOP 'Nobody,' said the Messenger STOP 'Quite right,' said the King: 'this young lady saw him too STOP So of course
Nobody walks slower than you. STOP 'I do my best,' the Messenger said in a sulky tone STOP 'I'm sure nobody
walks much faster than I do! STOP 'He can't do that,' said the King, 'or else he'd have been here first STOP However, now you've got your breath, you may tell us what's happened in
the town. STOP 'I'll whisper it,' said the Messenger, putting his hands to his mouth
in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close to the King's
ear STOP Alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news too STOP However, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of his
voice 'They're at it again! STOP 'Do you call THAT a whisper? STOP cried the poor King, jumping up and
shaking himself STOP 'If you do such a thing again, I'll have you buttered STOP It went through and through my head like an earthquake! STOP 'It would have to be a very tiny earthquake! STOP thought Alice STOP 'Who are at
it again? STOP she ventured to ask STOP 'Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course,' said the King STOP 'Fighting for the crown? STOP 'Yes, to be sure,' said the King: 'and the best of the joke is, that
it's MY crown all the while STOP Let's run and see them. STOP And they trotted
off, Alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the old
song:--


   'The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown:
   The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town STOP Some gave them white bread, some gave them brown;
   Some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town. STOP 'Does--the one--that wins--get the crown? STOP she asked, as well as she
could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath STOP 'Dear me, no! STOP said the King STOP 'What an idea! STOP 'Would you--be good enough,' Alice panted out, after running a little
further, 'to stop a minute--just to get--one's breath again? STOP 'I'm GOOD enough,' the King said, 'only I'm not strong enough STOP You see,
a minute goes by so fearfully quick STOP You might as well try to stop a
Bandersnatch! STOP Alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence,
till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the
Lion and Unicorn were fighting STOP They were in such a cloud of dust, that
at first Alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managed
to distinguish the Unicorn by his horn STOP They placed themselves close to where Hatta, the other messenger, was
standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece
of bread-and-butter in the other STOP 'He's only just out of prison, and he hadn't finished his tea when
he was sent in,' Haigha whispered to Alice: 'and they only give them
oyster-shells in there--so you see he's very hungry and thirsty STOP How
are you, dear child? STOP he went on, putting his arm affectionately round
Hatta's neck STOP Hatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and butter STOP 'Were you happy in prison, dear child? STOP said Haigha STOP Hatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickled down
his cheek: but not a word would he say STOP 'Speak, can't you! STOP Haigha cried impatiently STOP But Hatta only munched
away, and drank some more tea STOP 'Speak, won't you! STOP cried the King STOP 'How are they getting on with the
fight? STOP Hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of
bread-and-butter STOP 'They're getting on very well,' he said in a choking
voice: 'each of them has been down about eighty-seven times. STOP 'Then I suppose they'll soon bring the white bread and the brown? STOP Alice
ventured to remark STOP 'It's waiting for 'em now,' said Hatta: 'this is a bit of it as I'm
eating. STOP There was a pause in the fight just then, and the Lion and the Unicorn
sat down, panting, while the King called out 'Ten minutes allowed for
refreshments! STOP Haigha and Hatta set to work at once, carrying rough
trays of white and brown bread STOP Alice took a piece to taste, but it was
VERY dry STOP 'I don't think they'll fight any more to-day,' the King said to Hatta:
'go and order the drums to begin. STOP And Hatta went bounding away like a
grasshopper STOP For a minute or two Alice stood silent, watching him STOP Suddenly she
brightened up STOP 'Look, look! STOP she cried, pointing eagerly STOP 'There's the
White Queen running across the country STOP She came flying out of the wood
over yonder--How fast those Queens CAN run! STOP 'There's some enemy after her, no doubt,' the King said, without even
looking round STOP 'That wood's full of them. STOP 'But aren't you going to run and help her? STOP Alice asked, very much
surprised at his taking it so quietly STOP 'No use, no use! STOP said the King STOP 'She runs so fearfully quick STOP You might
as well try to catch a Bandersnatch STOP But I'll make a memorandum about
her, if you like--She's a dear good creature,' he repeated softly to
himself, as he opened his memorandum-book STOP 'Do you spell "creature" with
a double "e"? STOP At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his
pockets STOP 'I had the best of it this time? STOP he said to the King, just
glancing at him as he passed STOP 'A little--a little,' the King replied, rather nervously STOP 'You shouldn't
have run him through with your horn, you know. STOP 'It didn't hurt him,' the Unicorn said carelessly, and he was going
on, when his eye happened to fall upon Alice: he turned round rather
instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the
deepest disgust STOP 'What--is--this? STOP he said at last STOP 'This is a child! STOP Haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of Alice
to introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an
Anglo-Saxon attitude STOP 'We only found it to-day STOP It's as large as life,
and twice as natural! STOP 'I always thought they were fabulous monsters! STOP said the Unicorn STOP 'Is it
alive? STOP 'It can talk,' said Haigha, solemnly STOP The Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said 'Talk, child. STOP Alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: 'Do
you know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too STOP I never
saw one alive before! STOP 'Well, now that we HAVE seen each other,' said the Unicorn, 'if you'll
believe in me, I'll believe in you STOP Is that a bargain? STOP 'Yes, if you like,' said Alice STOP 'Come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man! STOP the Unicorn went on, turning
from her to the King STOP 'None of your brown bread for me! STOP 'Certainly--certainly! STOP the King muttered, and beckoned to Haigha STOP 'Open
the bag! STOP he whispered STOP 'Quick STOP Not that one--that's full of hay! STOP Haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to Alice to hold,
while he got out a dish and carving-knife STOP How they all came out of it
Alice couldn't guess STOP It was just like a conjuring-trick, she thought STOP The Lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very
tired and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut STOP 'What's this! STOP he said,
blinking lazily at Alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that
sounded like the tolling of a great bell STOP 'Ah, what IS it, now? STOP the Unicorn cried eagerly STOP 'You'll never guess STOP _I_ couldn't. STOP The Lion looked at Alice wearily STOP 'Are you animal--vegetable--or
mineral? STOP he said, yawning at every other word STOP 'It's a fabulous monster! STOP the Unicorn cried out, before Alice could
reply STOP 'Then hand round the plum-cake, Monster,' the Lion said, lying down and
putting his chin on his paws STOP 'And sit down, both of you,' (to the King
and the Unicorn): 'fair play with the cake, you know! STOP The King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between
the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him STOP 'What a fight we might have for the crown, NOW! STOP the Unicorn said,
looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor King was nearly shaking
off his head, he trembled so much STOP 'I should win easy,' said the Lion STOP 'I'm not so sure of that,' said the Unicorn STOP 'Why, I beat you all round the town, you chicken! STOP the Lion replied
angrily, half getting up as he spoke STOP Here the King interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very
nervous, and his voice quite quivered STOP 'All round the town? STOP he
said STOP 'That's a good long way STOP Did you go by the old bridge, or the
market-place STOP You get the best view by the old bridge. STOP 'I'm sure I don't know,' the Lion growled out as he lay down again STOP 'There was too much dust to see anything STOP What a time the Monster is,
cutting up that cake! STOP Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great
dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife STOP 'It's
very provoking! STOP she said, in reply to the Lion (she was getting quite
used to being called 'the Monster') STOP 'I've cut several slices already,
but they always join on again! STOP 'You don't know how to manage Looking-glass cakes,' the Unicorn
remarked STOP 'Hand it round first, and cut it afterwards. STOP This sounded nonsense, but Alice very obediently got up, and carried the
dish round, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so STOP 'NOW cut it up,' said the Lion, as she returned to her place with the
empty dish STOP 'I say, this isn't fair! STOP cried the Unicorn, as Alice sat with the knife
in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin STOP 'The Monster has given the
Lion twice as much as me! STOP 'She's kept none for herself, anyhow,' said the Lion STOP 'Do you like
plum-cake, Monster? STOP But before Alice could answer him, the drums began STOP Where the noise came from, she couldn't make out: the air seemed full
of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite
deafened STOP She started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in
her terror,

                          

                        

                          

and had just time to see the Lion and the Unicorn rise to their feet,
with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she dropped
to her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to shut out
the dreadful uproar STOP 'If THAT doesn't "drum them out of town,"' she thought to herself,
'nothing ever will! STOP  STOP 'It's my own Invention'

After a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead
silence, and Alice lifted up her head in some alarm STOP There was no one
to be seen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming
about the Lion and the Unicorn and those queer Anglo-Saxon Messengers STOP However, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she
had tried to cut the plum-cake, 'So I wasn't dreaming, after all,' she
said to herself, 'unless--unless we're all part of the same dream STOP Only
I do hope it's MY dream, and not the Red King's STOP I don't like belonging
to another person's dream,' she went on in a rather complaining tone:
'I've a great mind to go and wake him, and see what happens! STOP At this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of
'Ahoy STOP Ahoy STOP Check! STOP and a Knight dressed in crimson armour came
galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club STOP Just as he reached
her, the horse stopped suddenly: 'You're my prisoner! STOP the Knight cried,
as he tumbled off his horse STOP Startled as she was, Alice was more frightened for him than for herself
at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again STOP As soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he began once more 'You're
my--' but here another voice broke in 'Ahoy STOP Ahoy STOP Check! STOP and Alice
looked round in some surprise for the new enemy STOP This time it was a White Knight STOP He drew up at Alice's side, and tumbled
off his horse just as the Red Knight had done: then he got on again,
and the two Knights sat and looked at each other for some time without
speaking STOP Alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment STOP 'She's MY prisoner, you know! STOP the Red Knight said at last STOP 'Yes, but then _I_ came and rescued her! STOP the White Knight replied STOP 'Well, we must fight for her, then,' said the Red Knight, as he took up
his helmet (which hung from the saddle, and was something the shape of a
horse's head), and put it on STOP 'You will observe the Rules of Battle, of course? STOP the White Knight
remarked, putting on his helmet too STOP 'I always do,' said the Red Knight, and they began banging away at each
other with such fury that Alice got behind a tree to be out of the way
of the blows STOP 'I wonder, now, what the Rules of Battle are,' she said to herself, as
she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: 'one
Rule seems to be, that if one Knight hits the other, he knocks him off
his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himself--and another Rule
seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were
Punch and Judy--What a noise they make when they tumble STOP Just like
a whole set of fire-irons falling into the fender STOP And how quiet the
horses are STOP They let them get on and off them just as if they were
tables! STOP Another Rule of Battle, that Alice had not noticed, seemed to be that
they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both
falling off in this way, side by side: when they got up again, they
shook hands, and then the Red Knight mounted and galloped off STOP 'It was a glorious victory, wasn't it? STOP said the White Knight, as he
came up panting STOP 'I don't know,' Alice said doubtfully STOP 'I don't want to be anybody's
prisoner STOP I want to be a Queen. STOP 'So you will, when you've crossed the next brook,' said the White
Knight STOP 'I'll see you safe to the end of the wood--and then I must go
back, you know STOP That's the end of my move. STOP 'Thank you very much,' said Alice STOP 'May I help you off with your
helmet? STOP It was evidently more than he could manage by himself; however,
she managed to shake him out of it at last STOP 'Now one can breathe more easily,' said the Knight, putting back his
shaggy hair with both hands, and turning his gentle face and large mild
eyes to Alice STOP She thought she had never seen such a strange-looking
soldier in all her life STOP He was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very badly, and
he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder,
upside-down, and with the lid hanging open STOP Alice looked at it with
great curiosity STOP 'I see you're admiring my little box. STOP the Knight said in a friendly
tone STOP 'It's my own invention--to keep clothes and sandwiches in STOP You see
I carry it upside-down, so that the rain can't get in. STOP 'But the things can get OUT,' Alice gently remarked STOP 'Do you know the
lid's open? STOP 'I didn't know it,' the Knight said, a shade of vexation passing over
his face STOP 'Then all the things must have fallen out STOP And the box is no
use without them. STOP He unfastened it as he spoke, and was just going to
throw it into the bushes, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him,
and he hung it carefully on a tree STOP 'Can you guess why I did that? STOP he
said to Alice STOP Alice shook her head STOP 'In hopes some bees may make a nest in it--then I should get the honey. STOP 'But you've got a bee-hive--or something like one--fastened to the
saddle,' said Alice STOP 'Yes, it's a very good bee-hive,' the Knight said in a discontented
tone, 'one of the best kind STOP But not a single bee has come near it yet STOP And the other thing is a mouse-trap STOP I suppose the mice keep the bees
out--or the bees keep the mice out, I don't know which. STOP 'I was wondering what the mouse-trap was for,' said Alice STOP 'It isn't
very likely there would be any mice on the horse's back. STOP 'Not very likely, perhaps,' said the Knight: 'but if they DO come, I
don't choose to have them running all about. STOP 'You see,' he went on after a pause, 'it's as well to be provided for
EVERYTHING STOP That's the reason the horse has all those anklets round his
feet. STOP 'But what are they for? STOP Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity STOP 'To guard against the bites of sharks,' the Knight replied STOP 'It's an
invention of my own STOP And now help me on STOP I'll go with you to the end of
the wood--What's the dish for? STOP 'It's meant for plum-cake,' said Alice STOP 'We'd better take it with us,' the Knight said STOP 'It'll come in handy if
we find any plum-cake STOP Help me to get it into this bag. STOP This took a very long time to manage, though Alice held the bag open
very carefully, because the Knight was so VERY awkward in putting in
the dish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself
instead STOP 'It's rather a tight fit, you see,' he said, as they got it in
a last; 'There are so many candlesticks in the bag. STOP And he hung it
to the saddle, which was already loaded with bunches of carrots, and
fire-irons, and many other things STOP 'I hope you've got your hair well fastened on? STOP he continued, as they
set off STOP 'Only in the usual way,' Alice said, smiling STOP 'That's hardly enough,' he said, anxiously STOP 'You see the wind is so VERY
strong here STOP It's as strong as soup. STOP 'Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off? STOP Alice enquired STOP 'Not yet,' said the Knight STOP 'But I've got a plan for keeping it from
FALLING off. STOP 'I should like to hear it, very much. STOP 'First you take an upright stick,' said the Knight STOP 'Then you make your
hair creep up it, like a fruit-tree STOP Now the reason hair falls off is
because it hangs DOWN--things never fall UPWARDS, you know STOP It's a plan
of my own invention STOP You may try it if you like. STOP It didn't sound a comfortable plan, Alice thought, and for a few minutes
she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and every now and then
stopping to help the poor Knight, who certainly was NOT a good rider STOP Whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in
front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather
suddenly), he fell off behind STOP Otherwise he kept on pretty well, except
that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he
generally did this on the side on which Alice was walking, she soon
found that it was the best plan not to walk QUITE close to the horse STOP 'I'm afraid you've not had much practice in riding,' she ventured to
say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble STOP The Knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the
remark STOP 'What makes you say that? STOP he asked, as he scrambled back into
the saddle, keeping hold of Alice's hair with one hand, to save himself
from falling over on the other side STOP 'Because people don't fall off quite so often, when they've had much
practice. STOP 'I've had plenty of practice,' the Knight said very gravely: 'plenty of
practice! STOP Alice could think of nothing better to say than 'Indeed? STOP but she said
it as heartily as she could STOP They went on a little way in silence after
this, the Knight with his eyes shut, muttering to himself, and Alice
watching anxiously for the next tumble STOP 'The great art of riding,' the Knight suddenly began in a loud voice,
waving his right arm as he spoke, 'is to keep--' Here the sentence ended
as suddenly as it had begun, as the Knight fell heavily on the top of
his head exactly in the path where Alice was walking STOP She was quite
frightened this time, and said in an anxious tone, as she picked him up,
'I hope no bones are broken? STOP 'None to speak of,' the Knight said, as if he didn't mind breaking two
or three of them STOP 'The great art of riding, as I was saying, is--to keep
your balance properly STOP Like this, you know--'

He let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show Alice
what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the
horse's feet STOP 'Plenty of practice! STOP he went on repeating, all the time that Alice was
getting him on his feet again STOP 'Plenty of practice! STOP 'It's too ridiculous! STOP cried Alice, losing all her patience this time STOP 'You ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you ought! STOP 'Does that kind go smoothly? STOP the Knight asked in a tone of great
interest, clasping his arms round the horse's neck as he spoke, just in
time to save himself from tumbling off again STOP 'Much more smoothly than a live horse,' Alice said, with a little scream
of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it STOP 'I'll get one,' the Knight said thoughtfully to himself STOP 'One or
two--several. STOP There was a short silence after this, and then the Knight went on again STOP 'I'm a great hand at inventing things STOP Now, I daresay you noticed, that
last time you picked me up, that I was looking rather thoughtful? STOP 'You WERE a little grave,' said Alice STOP 'Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate--would
you like to hear it? STOP 'Very much indeed,' Alice said politely STOP 'I'll tell you how I came to think of it,' said the Knight STOP 'You see, I
said to myself, "The only difficulty is with the feet: the HEAD is high
enough already. STOP Now, first I put my head on the top of the gate--then I
stand on my head--then the feet are high enough, you see--then I'm over,
you see. STOP 'Yes, I suppose you'd be over when that was done,' Alice said
thoughtfully: 'but don't you think it would be rather hard? STOP 'I haven't tried it yet,' the Knight said, gravely: 'so I can't tell for
certain--but I'm afraid it WOULD be a little hard. STOP He looked so vexed at the idea, that Alice changed the subject hastily STOP 'What a curious helmet you've got! STOP she said cheerfully STOP 'Is that your
invention too? STOP The Knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the
saddle STOP 'Yes,' he said, 'but I've invented a better one than that--like
a sugar loaf STOP When I used to wear it, if I fell off the horse, it always
touched the ground directly STOP So I had a VERY little way to fall, you
see--But there WAS the danger of falling INTO it, to be sure STOP That
happened to me once--and the worst of it was, before I could get out
again, the other White Knight came and put it on STOP He thought it was his
own helmet. STOP The knight looked so solemn about it that Alice did not dare to laugh STOP 'I'm afraid you must have hurt him,' she said in a trembling voice,
'being on the top of his head. STOP 'I had to kick him, of course,' the Knight said, very seriously STOP 'And
then he took the helmet off again--but it took hours and hours to get me
out STOP I was as fast as--as lightning, you know. STOP 'But that's a different kind of fastness,' Alice objected STOP The Knight shook his head STOP 'It was all kinds of fastness with me, I can
assure you! STOP he said STOP He raised his hands in some excitement as he said
this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a
deep ditch STOP Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him STOP She was rather
startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and she
was afraid that he really WAS hurt this time STOP However, though she could
see nothing but the soles of his feet, she was much relieved to hear
that he was talking on in his usual tone STOP 'All kinds of fastness,'
he repeated: 'but it was careless of him to put another man's helmet
on--with the man in it, too. STOP 'How CAN you go on talking so quietly, head downwards? STOP Alice asked, as
she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap on the bank STOP The Knight looked surprised at the question STOP 'What does it matter where
my body happens to be? STOP he said STOP 'My mind goes on working all the same STOP In fact, the more head downwards I am, the more I keep inventing new
things. STOP 'Now the cleverest thing of the sort that I ever did,' he went on after
a pause, 'was inventing a new pudding during the meat-course. STOP 'In time to have it cooked for the next course? STOP said Alice STOP 'Well,
not the NEXT course,' the Knight said in a slow thoughtful tone: 'no,
certainly not the next COURSE. STOP 'Then it would have to be the next day STOP I suppose you wouldn't have two
pudding-courses in one dinner? STOP 'Well, not the NEXT day,' the Knight repeated as before: 'not the next
DAY STOP In fact,' he went on, holding his head down, and his voice getting
lower and lower, 'I don't believe that pudding ever WAS cooked STOP In fact,
I don't believe that pudding ever WILL be cooked STOP And yet it was a very
clever pudding to invent. STOP 'What did you mean it to be made of? STOP Alice asked, hoping to cheer him
up, for the poor Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it STOP 'It began with blotting paper,' the Knight answered with a groan STOP 'That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid--'

'Not very nice ALONE,' he interrupted, quite eagerly: 'but you've no
idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other things--such as
gunpowder and sealing-wax STOP And here I must leave you. STOP They had just
come to the end of the wood STOP Alice could only look puzzled: she was thinking of the pudding STOP 'You are sad,' the Knight said in an anxious tone: 'let me sing you a
song to comfort you. STOP 'Is it very long? STOP Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry
that day STOP 'It's long,' said the Knight, 'but very, VERY beautiful STOP Everybody that
hears me sing it--either it brings the TEARS into their eyes, or else--'

'Or else what? STOP said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause STOP 'Or else it doesn't, you know STOP The name of the song is called "HADDOCKS'
EYES." STOP 'Oh, that's the name of the song, is it? STOP Alice said, trying to feel
interested STOP 'No, you don't understand,' the Knight said, looking a little vexed STOP 'That's what the name is CALLED STOP The name really IS "THE AGED AGED
MAN." STOP 'Then I ought to have said "That's what the SONG is called"? STOP Alice
corrected herself STOP 'No, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing STOP The SONG is called "WAYS
AND MEANS": but that's only what it's CALLED, you know! STOP 'Well, what IS the song, then? STOP said Alice, who was by this time
completely bewildered STOP 'I was coming to that,' the Knight said STOP 'The song really IS "A-SITTING
ON A GATE": and the tune's my own invention. STOP So saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck:
then, slowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint smile lighting
up his gentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the music of his song, he
began STOP Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The
Looking-Glass, this was the one that she always remembered most clearly STOP Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again, as if it
had been only yesterday--the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the
Knight--the setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on his
armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her--the horse quietly
moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the
grass at her feet--and the black shadows of the forest behind--all this
she took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes, she
leant against a tree, watching the strange pair, and listening, in a
half dream, to the melancholy music of the song STOP 'But the tune ISN'T his own invention,' she said to herself: 'it's "I
GIVE THEE ALL, I CAN NO MORE." STOP She stood and listened very attentively,
but no tears came into her eyes STOP 'I'll tell thee everything I can;
      There's little to relate STOP I saw an aged aged man,
      A-sitting on a gate STOP "Who are you, aged man? STOP I said,
      "and how is it you live? STOP And his answer trickled through my head
      Like water through a sieve STOP He said "I look for butterflies
      That sleep among the wheat:
     I make them into mutton-pies,
      And sell them in the street STOP I sell them unto men," he said,
      "Who sail on stormy seas;
     And that's the way I get my bread--
      A trifle, if you please. STOP But I was thinking of a plan
      To dye one's whiskers green,
     And always use so large a fan
      That they could not be seen STOP So, having no reply to give
      To what the old man said,
     I cried, "Come, tell me how you live! STOP And thumped him on the head STOP His accents mild took up the tale:
      He said "I go my ways,
     And when I find a mountain-rill,
      I set it in a blaze;
     And thence they make a stuff they call
      Rolands' Macassar Oil--
     Yet twopence-halfpenny is all
      They give me for my toil. STOP But I was thinking of a way
      To feed oneself on batter,
     And so go on from day to day
      Getting a little fatter STOP I shook him well from side to side,
      Until his face was blue:
     "Come, tell me how you live," I cried,
      "And what it is you do! STOP He said "I hunt for haddocks' eyes
      Among the heather bright,
     And work them into waistcoat-buttons
      In the silent night STOP And these I do not sell for gold
      Or coin of silvery shine
     But for a copper halfpenny,
      And that will purchase nine STOP "I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
      Or set limed twigs for crabs;
     I sometimes search the grassy knolls
      For wheels of Hansom-cabs STOP And that's the way" (he gave a wink)
      "By which I get my wealth--
     And very gladly will I drink
      Your Honour's noble health. STOP I heard him then, for I had just
      Completed my design
     To keep the Menai bridge from rust
      By boiling it in wine STOP I thanked him much for telling me
      The way he got his wealth,
     But chiefly for his wish that he
      Might drink my noble health STOP And now, if e'er by chance I put
      My fingers into glue
     Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
      Into a left-hand shoe,
     Or if I drop upon my toe
      A very heavy weight,
     I weep, for it reminds me so,
      Of that old man I used to know--

     Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow,
     Whose hair was whiter than the snow,
     Whose face was very like a crow,
     With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,
     Who seemed distracted with his woe,
     Who rocked his body to and fro,
     And muttered mumblingly and low,
     As if his mouth were full of dough,
     Who snorted like a buffalo--
     That summer evening, long ago,
      A-sitting on a gate. STOP As the Knight sang the last words of the ballad, he gathered up the
reins, and turned his horse's head along the road by which they had
come STOP 'You've only a few yards to go,' he said, 'down the hill and over
that little brook, and then you'll be a Queen--But you'll stay and
see me off first? STOP he added as Alice turned with an eager look in the
direction to which he pointed STOP 'I shan't be long STOP You'll wait and wave
your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road STOP I think it'll
encourage me, you see. STOP 'Of course I'll wait,' said Alice: 'and thank you very much for coming
so far--and for the song--I liked it very much. STOP 'I hope so,' the Knight said doubtfully: 'but you didn't cry so much as
I thought you would. STOP So they shook hands, and then the Knight rode slowly away into the
forest STOP 'It won't take long to see him OFF, I expect,' Alice said to
herself, as she stood watching him STOP 'There he goes STOP Right on his head as
usual STOP However, he gets on again pretty easily--that comes of having so
many things hung round the horse--' So she went on talking to herself,
as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and the
Knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other STOP After
the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved her
handkerchief to him, and waited till he was out of sight STOP 'I hope it encouraged him,' she said, as she turned to run down the
hill: 'and now for the last brook, and to be a Queen STOP How grand it
sounds! STOP A very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook STOP 'The
Eighth Square at last! STOP she cried as she bounded across,

                          

                        

                          

and threw herself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss, with little
flower-beds dotted about it here and there STOP 'Oh, how glad I am to get
here STOP And what IS this on my head? STOP she exclaimed in a tone of dismay,
as she put her hands up to something very heavy, and fitted tight all
round her head STOP 'But how CAN it have got there without my knowing it? STOP she said to
herself, as she lifted it off, and set it on her lap to make out what it
could possibly be STOP It was a golden crown STOP  STOP Queen Alice

'Well, this IS grand! STOP said Alice STOP 'I never expected I should be a Queen
so soon--and I'll tell you what it is, your majesty,' she went on in
a severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself), 'it'll
never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that STOP Queens have
to be dignified, you know! STOP So she got up and walked about--rather stiffly just at first, as she was
afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with the
thought that there was nobody to see her, 'and if I really am a Queen,'
she said as she sat down again, 'I shall be able to manage it quite well
in time. STOP Everything was happening so oddly that she didn't feel a bit surprised
at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her, one
on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came
there, but she feared it would not be quite civil STOP However, there would
be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over STOP 'Please, would
you tell me--' she began, looking timidly at the Red Queen STOP 'Speak when you're spoken to! STOP The Queen sharply interrupted her STOP 'But if everybody obeyed that rule,' said Alice, who was always ready
for a little argument, 'and if you only spoke when you were spoken to,
and the other person always waited for YOU to begin, you see nobody
would ever say anything, so that--'

'Ridiculous! STOP cried the Queen STOP 'Why, don't you see, child--' here she
broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a minute, suddenly
changed the subject of the conversation STOP 'What do you mean by "If you
really are a Queen" STOP What right have you to call yourself so STOP You can't
be a Queen, you know, till you've passed the proper examination STOP And the
sooner we begin it, the better. STOP 'I only said "if"! STOP poor Alice pleaded in a piteous tone STOP The two Queens looked at each other, and the Red Queen remarked, with a
little shudder, 'She SAYS she only said "if"--'

'But she said a great deal more than that! STOP the White Queen moaned,
wringing her hands STOP 'Oh, ever so much more than that! STOP 'So you did, you know,' the Red Queen said to Alice STOP 'Always speak the
truth--think before you speak--and write it down afterwards. STOP 'I'm sure I didn't mean--' Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen
interrupted her impatiently STOP 'That's just what I complain of STOP You SHOULD have meant STOP What do you
suppose is the use of child without any meaning STOP Even a joke should
have some meaning--and a child's more important than a joke, I hope STOP You
couldn't deny that, even if you tried with both hands. STOP 'I don't deny things with my HANDS,' Alice objected STOP 'Nobody said you did,' said the Red Queen STOP 'I said you couldn't if you
tried. STOP 'She's in that state of mind,' said the White Queen, 'that she wants to
deny SOMETHING--only she doesn't know what to deny! STOP 'A nasty, vicious temper,' the Red Queen remarked; and then there was an
uncomfortable silence for a minute or two STOP The Red Queen broke the silence by saying to the White Queen, 'I invite
you to Alice's dinner-party this afternoon. STOP The White Queen smiled feebly, and said 'And I invite YOU. STOP 'I didn't know I was to have a party at all,' said Alice; 'but if there
is to be one, I think _I_ ought to invite the guests. STOP 'We gave you the opportunity of doing it,' the Red Queen remarked: 'but
I daresay you've not had many lessons in manners yet? STOP 'Manners are not taught in lessons,' said Alice STOP 'Lessons teach you to
do sums, and things of that sort. STOP 'And you do Addition? STOP the White Queen asked STOP 'What's one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one? STOP 'I don't know,' said Alice STOP 'I lost count. STOP 'She can't do Addition,' the Red Queen interrupted STOP 'Can you do
Subtraction STOP Take nine from eight. STOP 'Nine from eight I can't, you know,' Alice replied very readily: 'but--'

'She can't do Subtraction,' said the White Queen STOP 'Can you do Division STOP Divide a loaf by a knife--what's the answer to that? STOP 'I suppose--' Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen answered for her STOP 'Bread-and-butter, of course STOP Try another Subtraction sum STOP Take a bone
from a dog: what remains? STOP Alice considered STOP 'The bone wouldn't remain, of course, if I took
it--and the dog wouldn't remain; it would come to bite me--and I'm sure
I shouldn't remain! STOP 'Then you think nothing would remain? STOP said the Red Queen STOP 'I think that's the answer. STOP 'Wrong, as usual,' said the Red Queen: 'the dog's temper would remain. STOP 'But I don't see how--'

'Why, look here! STOP the Red Queen cried STOP 'The dog would lose its temper,
wouldn't it? STOP 'Perhaps it would,' Alice replied cautiously STOP 'Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain! STOP the Queen
exclaimed triumphantly STOP Alice said, as gravely as she could, 'They might go different ways. STOP But
she couldn't help thinking to herself, 'What dreadful nonsense we ARE
talking! STOP 'She can't do sums a BIT! STOP the Queens said together, with great
emphasis STOP 'Can YOU do sums? STOP Alice said, turning suddenly on the White Queen, for
she didn't like being found fault with so much STOP The Queen gasped and shut her eyes STOP 'I can do Addition, if you give me
time--but I can't do Subtraction, under ANY circumstances! STOP 'Of course you know your A B C? STOP said the Red Queen STOP 'To be sure I do. STOP said Alice STOP 'So do I,' the White Queen whispered: 'we'll often say it over together,
dear STOP And I'll tell you a secret--I can read words of one letter STOP Isn't
THAT grand STOP However, don't be discouraged STOP You'll come to it in time. STOP Here the Red Queen began again STOP 'Can you answer useful questions? STOP she
said STOP 'How is bread made? STOP 'I know THAT! STOP Alice cried eagerly STOP 'You take some flour--'

'Where do you pick the flower? STOP the White Queen asked STOP 'In a garden, or
in the hedges? STOP 'Well, it isn't PICKED at all,' Alice explained: 'it's GROUND--'

'How many acres of ground? STOP said the White Queen STOP 'You mustn't leave out
so many things. STOP 'Fan her head! STOP the Red Queen anxiously interrupted STOP 'She'll be feverish
after so much thinking. STOP So they set to work and fanned her with bunches
of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew her hair about
so STOP 'She's all right again now,' said the Red Queen STOP 'Do you know Languages STOP What's the French for fiddle-de-dee? STOP 'Fiddle-de-dee's not English,' Alice replied gravely STOP 'Who ever said it was? STOP said the Red Queen STOP Alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time STOP 'If you'll
tell me what language "fiddle-de-dee" is, I'll tell you the French for
it! STOP she exclaimed triumphantly STOP But the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said 'Queens never
make bargains. STOP 'I wish Queens never asked questions,' Alice thought to herself STOP 'Don't let us quarrel,' the White Queen said in an anxious tone STOP 'What
is the cause of lightning? STOP 'The cause of lightning,' Alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite
certain about this, 'is the thunder--no, no! STOP she hastily corrected
herself STOP 'I meant the other way. STOP 'It's too late to correct it,' said the Red Queen: 'when you've once
said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences. STOP 'Which reminds me--' the White Queen said, looking down and nervously
clasping and unclasping her hands, 'we had SUCH a thunderstorm last
Tuesday--I mean one of the last set of Tuesdays, you know. STOP Alice was puzzled STOP 'In OUR country,' she remarked, 'there's only one day
at a time. STOP The Red Queen said, 'That's a poor thin way of doing things STOP Now HERE,
we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and sometimes
in the winter we take as many as five nights together--for warmth, you
know. STOP 'Are five nights warmer than one night, then? STOP Alice ventured to ask STOP 'Five times as warm, of course. STOP 'But they should be five times as COLD, by the same rule--'

'Just so! STOP cried the Red Queen STOP 'Five times as warm, AND five times
as cold--just as I'm five times as rich as you are, AND five times as
clever! STOP Alice sighed and gave it up STOP 'It's exactly like a riddle with no
answer! STOP she thought STOP 'Humpty Dumpty saw it too,' the White Queen went on in a low voice, more
as if she were talking to herself STOP 'He came to the door with a corkscrew
in his hand--'

'What did he want? STOP said the Red Queen STOP 'He said he WOULD come in,' the White Queen went on, 'because he was
looking for a hippopotamus STOP Now, as it happened, there wasn't such a
thing in the house, that morning. STOP 'Is there generally? STOP Alice asked in an astonished tone STOP 'Well, only on Thursdays,' said the Queen STOP 'I know what he came for,' said Alice: 'he wanted to punish the fish,
because--'

Here the White Queen began again STOP 'It was SUCH a thunderstorm, you can't
think! STOP ('She NEVER could, you know,' said the Red Queen. STOP 'And part of
the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in--and it went
rolling round the room in great lumps--and knocking over the tables and
things--till I was so frightened, I couldn't remember my own name! STOP Alice thought to herself, 'I never should TRY to remember my name in the
middle of an accident STOP Where would be the use of it? STOP but she did not
say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor Queen's feeling STOP 'Your Majesty must excuse her,' the Red Queen said to Alice, taking
one of the White Queen's hands in her own, and gently stroking it:
'she means well, but she can't help saying foolish things, as a general
rule. STOP The White Queen looked timidly at Alice, who felt she OUGHT to say
something kind, but really couldn't think of anything at the moment STOP 'She never was really well brought up,' the Red Queen went on: 'but
it's amazing how good-tempered she is STOP Pat her on the head, and see how
pleased she'll be! STOP But this was more than Alice had courage to do STOP 'A little kindness--and putting her hair in papers--would do wonders
with her--'

The White Queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on Alice's shoulder STOP 'I AM so sleepy? STOP she moaned STOP 'She's tired, poor thing! STOP said the Red Queen STOP 'Smooth her hair--lend
her your nightcap--and sing her a soothing lullaby. STOP 'I haven't got a nightcap with me,' said Alice, as she tried to obey the
first direction: 'and I don't know any soothing lullabies. STOP 'I must do it myself, then,' said the Red Queen, and she began:


   'Hush-a-by lady, in Alice's lap STOP Till the feast's ready, we've time for a nap:
   When the feast's over, we'll go to the ball--
   Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all STOP 'And now you know the words,' she added, as she put her head down on
Alice's other shoulder, 'just sing it through to ME STOP I'm getting sleepy,
too. STOP In another moment both Queens were fast asleep, and snoring loud STOP 'What AM I to do? STOP exclaimed Alice, looking about in great perplexity,
as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down from her
shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap STOP 'I don't think it EVER
happened before, that any one had to take care of two Queens asleep
at once STOP No, not in all the History of England--it couldn't, you know,
because there never was more than one Queen at a time STOP Do wake up, you
heavy things! STOP she went on in an impatient tone; but there was no answer
but a gentle snoring STOP The snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more like a
tune: at last she could even make out the words, and she listened so
eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly
missed them STOP She was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words
QUEEN ALICE in large letters, and on each side of the arch there was a
bell-handle; one was marked 'Visitors' Bell,' and the other 'Servants'
Bell. STOP 'I'll wait till the song's over,' thought Alice, 'and then I'll
ring--the--WHICH bell must I ring? STOP she went on, very much puzzled by
the names STOP 'I'm not a visitor, and I'm not a servant STOP There OUGHT to be
one marked "Queen," you know--'

Just then the door opened a little way, and a creature with a long beak
put its head out for a moment and said 'No admittance till the week
after next! STOP and shut the door again with a bang STOP Alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old
Frog, who was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towards
her: he was dressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on STOP 'What is it, now? STOP the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper STOP Alice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody STOP 'Where's the
servant whose business it is to answer the door? STOP she began angrily STOP 'Which door? STOP said the Frog STOP Alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he
spoke STOP 'THIS door, of course! STOP The Frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute:
then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were trying
whether the paint would come off; then he looked at Alice STOP 'To answer the door? STOP he said STOP 'What's it been asking of? STOP He was so
hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him STOP 'I don't know what you mean,' she said STOP 'I talks English, doesn't I? STOP the Frog went on STOP 'Or are you deaf STOP What
did it ask you? STOP 'Nothing! STOP Alice said impatiently STOP 'I've been knocking at it! STOP 'Shouldn't do that--shouldn't do that--' the Frog muttered STOP 'Vexes it,
you know. STOP Then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his
great feet STOP 'You let IT alone,' he panted out, as he hobbled back to his
tree, 'and it'll let YOU alone, you know. STOP At this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard
singing:


   'To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said,
   "I've a sceptre in hand, I've a crown on my head;
   Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be,
   Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me." STOP And hundreds of voices joined in the chorus:


  'Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,
  And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:
  Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea--
  And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three! STOP Then followed a confused noise of cheering, and Alice thought to
herself, 'Thirty times three makes ninety STOP I wonder if any one's
counting? STOP In a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill
voice sang another verse;


  '"O Looking-Glass creatures," quoth Alice, "draw near STOP 'Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear:
  'Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea
  Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!" STOP Then came the chorus again:--


  'Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,
  Or anything else that is pleasant to drink:
  Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine--
  And welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine! STOP 'Ninety times nine! STOP Alice repeated in despair, 'Oh, that'll never
be done STOP I'd better go in at once--' and there was a dead silence the
moment she appeared STOP Alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large
hall, and noticed that there were about fifty guests, of all kinds: some
were animals, some birds, and there were even a few flowers among them STOP 'I'm glad they've come without waiting to be asked,' she thought: 'I
should never have known who were the right people to invite! STOP There were three chairs at the head of the table; the Red and White
Queens had already taken two of them, but the middle one was empty STOP Alice sat down in it, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing
for some one to speak STOP At last the Red Queen began STOP 'You've missed the soup and fish,' she
said STOP 'Put on the joint! STOP And the waiters set a leg of mutton before
Alice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never had to carve
a joint before STOP 'You look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton,'
said the Red Queen STOP 'Alice--Mutton; Mutton--Alice. STOP The leg of mutton
got up in the dish and made a little bow to Alice; and Alice returned
the bow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused STOP 'May I give you a slice? STOP she said, taking up the knife and fork, and
looking from one Queen to the other STOP 'Certainly not,' the Red Queen said, very decidedly: 'it isn't etiquette
to cut any one you've been introduced to STOP Remove the joint! STOP And the
waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its place STOP 'I won't be introduced to the pudding, please,' Alice said rather
hastily, 'or we shall get no dinner at all STOP May I give you some? STOP But the Red Queen looked sulky, and growled 'Pudding--Alice;
Alice--Pudding STOP Remove the pudding! STOP and the waiters took it away so
quickly that Alice couldn't return its bow STOP However, she didn't see why the Red Queen should be the only one to give
orders, so, as an experiment, she called out 'Waiter STOP Bring back the
pudding! STOP and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick STOP It
was so large that she couldn't help feeling a LITTLE shy with it, as she
had been with the mutton; however, she conquered her shyness by a great
effort and cut a slice and handed it to the Red Queen STOP 'What impertinence! STOP said the Pudding STOP 'I wonder how you'd like it, if I
were to cut a slice out of YOU, you creature! STOP It spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and Alice hadn't a word to say
in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp STOP 'Make a remark,' said the Red Queen: 'it's ridiculous to leave all the
conversation to the pudding! STOP 'Do you know, I've had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me to-day,'
Alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment she opened
her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her; 'and
it's a very curious thing, I think--every poem was about fishes in some
way STOP Do you know why they're so fond of fishes, all about here? STOP She spoke to the Red Queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark STOP 'As to fishes,' she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth
close to Alice's ear, 'her White Majesty knows a lovely riddle--all in
poetry--all about fishes STOP Shall she repeat it? STOP 'Her Red Majesty's very kind to mention it,' the White Queen murmured
into Alice's other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon STOP 'It
would be SUCH a treat STOP May I? STOP 'Please do,' Alice said very politely STOP The White Queen laughed with delight, and stroked Alice's cheek STOP Then
she began:


    '"First, the fish must be caught. STOP That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it STOP "Next, the fish must be bought. STOP That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it STOP "Now cook me the fish! STOP That is easy, and will not take more than a minute STOP "Let it lie in a dish! STOP That is easy, because it already is in it STOP "Bring it here STOP Let me sup! STOP It is easy to set such a dish on the table STOP "Take the dish-cover up! STOP Ah, THAT is so hard that I fear I'm unable STOP For it holds it like glue--
  Holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle:
    Which is easiest to do,
  Un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle? STOP 'Take a minute to think about it, and then guess,' said the Red Queen STOP 'Meanwhile, we'll drink your health--Queen Alice's health! STOP she screamed
at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking it directly,
and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon
their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their
faces--others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off
the edges of the table--and three of them (who looked like kangaroos)
scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up
the gravy, 'just like pigs in a trough! STOP thought Alice STOP 'You ought to return thanks in a neat speech,' the Red Queen said,
frowning at Alice as she spoke STOP 'We must support you, you know,' the White Queen whispered, as Alice got
up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened STOP 'Thank you very much,' she whispered in reply, 'but I can do quite well
without. STOP 'That wouldn't be at all the thing,' the Red Queen said very decidedly:
so Alice tried to submit to it with a good grace STOP ('And they DID push so! STOP she said afterwards, when she was telling her
sister the history of the feast STOP 'You would have thought they wanted to
squeeze me flat!' STOP In fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she
made her speech: the two Queens pushed her so, one on each side, that
they nearly lifted her up into the air: 'I rise to return thanks--'
Alice began: and she really DID rise as she spoke, several inches; but
she got hold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself down
again STOP 'Take care of yourself! STOP screamed the White Queen, seizing Alice's hair
with both her hands STOP 'Something's going to happen! STOP And then (as Alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things happened
in a moment STOP The candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something
like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top STOP As to the bottles, they
each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and
so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: 'and
very like birds they look,' Alice thought to herself, as well as she
could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning STOP At this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned to see
what was the matter with the White Queen; but, instead of the Queen,
there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair STOP 'Here I am! STOP cried a
voice from the soup tureen, and Alice turned again, just in time to see
the Queen's broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over
the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup STOP There was not a moment to be lost STOP Already several of the guests were
lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table
towards Alice's chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of
its way STOP 'I can't stand this any longer! STOP she cried as she jumped up and seized
the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and plates, dishes,
guests, and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor STOP 'And as for YOU,' she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red Queen, whom
she considered as the cause of all the mischief--but the Queen was no
longer at her side--she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a
little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round
after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her STOP At any other time, Alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was
far too much excited to be surprised at anything NOW STOP 'As for YOU,'
she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of
jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table, 'I'll shake
you into a kitten, that I will! STOP  STOP Shaking

She took her off the table as she spoke, and shook her backwards and
forwards with all her might STOP The Red Queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very
small, and her eyes got large and green: and still, as Alice went on
shaking her, she kept on growing shorter--and fatter--and softer--and
rounder--and--




 STOP Waking

--and it really WAS a kitten, after all STOP  STOP Which Dreamed it STOP 'Your majesty shouldn't purr so loud,' Alice said, rubbing her eyes, and
addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity STOP 'You
woke me out of oh STOP such a nice dream STOP And you've been along with me,
Kitty--all through the Looking-Glass world STOP Did you know it, dear? STOP It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the
remark) that, whatever you say to them, they ALWAYS purr STOP 'If they would
only purr for "yes" and mew for "no," or any rule of that sort,' she had
said, 'so that one could keep up a conversation STOP But how CAN you talk
with a person if they always say the same thing? STOP On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess
whether it meant 'yes' or 'no. STOP So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the
Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put
the kitten and the Queen to look at each other STOP 'Now, Kitty! STOP she cried,
clapping her hands triumphantly STOP 'Confess that was what you turned
into! STOP ('But it wouldn't look at it,' she said, when she was explaining the
thing afterwards to her sister: 'it turned away its head, and pretended
not to see it: but it looked a LITTLE ashamed of itself, so I think it
MUST have been the Red Queen.' STOP 'Sit up a little more stiffly, dear! STOP Alice cried with a merry laugh STOP 'And curtsey while you're thinking what to--what to purr STOP It saves time,
remember! STOP And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, 'just in
honour of having been a Red Queen. STOP 'Snowdrop, my pet! STOP she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White
Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, 'when WILL
Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder STOP That must be the
reason you were so untidy in my dream--Dinah STOP do you know that you're
scrubbing a White Queen STOP Really, it's most disrespectful of you STOP 'And what did DINAH turn to, I wonder? STOP she prattled on, as she settled
comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand,
to watch the kittens STOP 'Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to Humpty Dumpty STOP I
THINK you did--however, you'd better not mention it to your friends just
yet, for I'm not sure STOP 'By the way, Kitty, if only you'd been really with me in my dream, there
was one thing you WOULD have enjoyed--I had such a quantity of poetry
said to me, all about fishes STOP To-morrow morning you shall have a real
treat STOP All the time you're eating your breakfast, I'll repeat "The
Walrus and the Carpenter" to you; and then you can make believe it's
oysters, dear STOP 'Now, Kitty, let's consider who it was that dreamed it all STOP This is a
serious question, my dear, and you should NOT go on licking your paw
like that--as if Dinah hadn't washed you this morning STOP You see, Kitty,
it MUST have been either me or the Red King STOP He was part of my dream,
of course--but then I was part of his dream, too STOP WAS it the Red King,
Kitty STOP You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know--Oh, Kitty, DO
help to settle it STOP I'm sure your paw can wait! STOP But the provoking kitten
only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn't heard the question STOP Which do YOU think it was STOP ----

I STOP The Period


It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair,
we had everything before us,
we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven,
we were all going direct the other way--
in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of
its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only STOP There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
a fair face, on the throne of France STOP In both countries it was clearer
than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
that things in general were settled for ever STOP It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five STOP Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,
as at this STOP Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster STOP Even the Cock-lane
ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its
messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally
deficient in originality) rapped out theirs STOP Mere messages in the
earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,
from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange
to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any
communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane
brood STOP France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down
hill, making paper money and spending it STOP Under the guidance of her
Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane
achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue
torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not
kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty
yards STOP It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and
Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,
already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into
boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in
it, terrible in history STOP It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses
of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were
sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with
rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which
the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of
the Revolution STOP But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work
unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about
with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous STOP In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
justify much national boasting STOP Daring burglaries by armed men, and
highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;
families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman
in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the
mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and
then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the
failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;
that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand
and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the
illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London
gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law
fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;
thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at
Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search
for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the
musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences
much out of the common way STOP In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy
and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing
up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on
Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the
hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of
Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,
and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of
sixpence STOP All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close
upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five STOP Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,
those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the
fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights
with a high hand STOP Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred
and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small
creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the
roads that lay before them STOP II STOP The Mail


It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business STOP The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up
Shooter's Hill STOP He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,
as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish
for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,
and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the
horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the
coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back
to Blackheath STOP Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in
combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals
are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to
their duty STOP With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through
the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were
falling to pieces at the larger joints STOP As often as the driver rested
them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho STOP so-ho-then!” the
near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an
unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the
hill STOP Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a
nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind STOP There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its
forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding
none STOP A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the
air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the
waves of an unwholesome sea might do STOP It was dense enough to shut out
everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,
and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
into it, as if they had made it all STOP Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the
side of the mail STOP All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
ears, and wore jack-boots STOP Not one of the three could have said, from
anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was
hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from
the eyes of the body, of his two companions STOP In those days, travellers
were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on
the road might be a robber or in league with robbers STOP As to the latter,
when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in
“the Captain's” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards STOP So the guard
of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one
thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as
he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,
and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a
loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,
deposited on a substratum of cutlass STOP The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they
all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but
the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have
taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the
journey STOP “Wo-ho!” said the coachman STOP “So, then STOP One more pull and you're at the
top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to
it!--Joe!”

“Halloa!” the guard replied STOP “What o'clock do you make it, Joe?”

“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”

“My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of Shooter's
yet STOP Tst STOP Yah STOP Get on with you!”

The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,
made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed
suit STOP Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its
passengers squashing along by its side STOP They had stopped when the coach
stopped, and they kept close company with it STOP If any one of the three
had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead
into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of
getting shot instantly as a highwayman STOP The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill STOP The horses
stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in STOP “Tst STOP Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his
box STOP “What do you say, Tom?”

They both listened STOP “I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.”

“_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,” returned the guard, leaving his hold
of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place STOP “Gentlemen STOP In the king's
name, all of you!”

With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on
the offensive STOP The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;
the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow STOP He
remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained
in the road below him STOP They all looked from the coachman to the guard,
and from the guard to the coachman, and listened STOP The coachman looked
back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up
his ears and looked back, without contradicting STOP The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring
of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet
indeed STOP The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to
the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation STOP The hearts of the
passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the
quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding
the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation STOP The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill STOP “So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar STOP “Yo there STOP Stand STOP I shall fire!”

The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,
a man's voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”

“Never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted STOP “What are you?”

“_Is_ that the Dover mail?”

“Why do you want to know?”

“I want a passenger, if it is.”

“What passenger?”

“Mr STOP Jarvis Lorry.”

Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name STOP The guard,
the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully STOP “Keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist,
“because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in
your lifetime STOP Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.”

“What is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering
speech STOP “Who wants me STOP Is it Jerry?”

(“I don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry,” growled the guard to
himself STOP “He's hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.”)

“Yes, Mr. Lorry.”

“What is the matter?”

“A despatch sent after you from over yonder STOP T. and Co.”

“I know this messenger, guard,” said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the
road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two
passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and
pulled up the window STOP “He may come close; there's nothing wrong.”

“I hope there ain't, but I can't make so 'Nation sure of that,” said the
guard, in gruff soliloquy STOP “Hallo you!”

“Well STOP And hallo you!” said Jerry, more hoarsely than before STOP “Come on at a footpace STOP d'ye mind me STOP And if you've got holsters to that
saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em STOP For I'm a devil
at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead STOP So
now let's look at you.”

The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,
and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood STOP The rider
stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger
a small folded paper STOP The rider's horse was blown, and both horse and
rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of
the man STOP “Guard!” said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence STOP The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised
blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman,
answered curtly, “Sir.”

“There is nothing to apprehend STOP I belong to Tellson's Bank STOP You must
know Tellson's Bank in London STOP I am going to Paris on business STOP A crown
to drink STOP I may read this?”

“If so be as you're quick, sir.”

He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and
read--first to himself and then aloud: “'Wait at Dover for Mam'selle. STOP It's not long, you see, guard STOP Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED
TO LIFE.”

Jerry started in his saddle STOP “That's a Blazing strange answer, too,”
 said he, at his hoarsest STOP “Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as
well as if I wrote STOP Make the best of your way STOP Good night.”

With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at
all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted
their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general
pretence of being asleep STOP With no more definite purpose than to escape
the hazard of originating any other kind of action STOP The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round
it as it began the descent STOP The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss
in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and
having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,
looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a
few smith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box STOP For he was
furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown
and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut
himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,
and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in
five minutes STOP “Tom!” softly over the coach roof STOP “Hallo, Joe.”

“Did you hear the message?”

“I did, Joe.”

“What did you make of it, Tom?”

“Nothing at all, Joe.”

“That's a coincidence, too,” the guard mused, “for I made the same of it
myself.”

Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not
only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and
shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of
holding about half a gallon STOP After standing with the bridle over his
heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within
hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the
hill STOP “After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won't trust your
fore-legs till I get you on the level,” said this hoarse messenger,
glancing at his mare STOP “'Recalled to life. STOP That's a Blazing strange
message STOP Much of that wouldn't do for you, Jerry STOP I say, Jerry STOP You'd
be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion,
Jerry!”




III STOP The Night Shadows


A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is
constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other STOP A
solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every
one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every
room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating
heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of
its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it STOP Something of the
awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this STOP No more can I
turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time
to read it all STOP No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable
water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses
of buried treasure and other things submerged STOP It was appointed that the
book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read
but a page STOP It was appointed that the water should be locked in an
eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood
in ignorance on the shore STOP My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,
my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable
consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that
individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end STOP In
any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there
a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their
innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them STOP As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the
messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the
first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London STOP So with the
three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail
coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had
been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the
breadth of a county between him and the next STOP The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at
ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his
own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes STOP He had eyes that
assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with
no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they
were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too
far apart STOP They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like
a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and
throat, which descended nearly to the wearer's knees STOP When he stopped
for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he
poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he
muffled again STOP “No, Jerry, no!” said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode STOP “It wouldn't do for you, Jerry STOP Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn't
suit _your_ line of business STOP Recalled-- STOP Bust me if I don't think he'd
been a drinking!”

His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several
times, to take off his hat to scratch his head STOP Except on the crown,
which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all
over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose STOP It was
so like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might
have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over STOP While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
watchman in his box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar, who
was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such
shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness STOP They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road STOP What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon
its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside STOP To whom,
likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms
their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested STOP Tellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail STOP As the bank
passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what
lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger,
and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special
jolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little
coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the
bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great
stroke of business STOP The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,
and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with
all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time STOP Then
the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson's, with such of their valuable
stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a
little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among
them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them
safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them STOP But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach
(in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was
always with him, there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run, all through the night STOP He was on his way to dig some one
out of a grave STOP Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him
was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did
not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by
years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed,
and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state STOP Pride, contempt,
defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;
so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands
and figures STOP But the face was in the main one face, and every head was
prematurely white STOP A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this
spectre:

“Buried how long?”

The answer was always the same: “Almost eighteen years.”

“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”

“Long ago.”

“You know that you are recalled to life?”

“They tell me so.”

“I hope you care to live?”

“I can't say.”

“Shall I show her to you STOP Will you come and see her?”

The answers to this question were various and contradictory STOP Sometimes
the broken reply was, “Wait STOP It would kill me if I saw her too soon.”
 Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was,
“Take me to her.” Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it
was, “I don't know her STOP I don't understand.”

After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig,
and dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his
hands--to dig this wretched creature out STOP Got out at last, with earth
hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust STOP The
passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the
reality of mist and rain on his cheek STOP Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving
patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating
by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train
of the night shadows within STOP The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the
real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express
sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there STOP Out
of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost
it again STOP “Buried how long?”

“Almost eighteen years.”

“I hope you care to live?”

“I can't say.”

Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two
passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm
securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two
slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again
slid away into the bank and the grave STOP “Buried how long?”

“Almost eighteen years.”

“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”

“Long ago.”

The words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in
his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary
passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the
shadows of the night were gone STOP He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun STOP There was a
ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left
last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,
in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
upon the trees STOP Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,
and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful STOP “Eighteen years!” said the passenger, looking at the sun STOP “Gracious
Creator of day STOP To be buried alive for eighteen years!”




IV STOP The Preparation


When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,
the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his
custom was STOP He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey
from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous
traveller upon STOP By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be
congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective
roadside destinations STOP The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp
and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather
like a larger dog-kennel STOP Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out
of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and
muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog STOP “There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?”

“Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair STOP The
tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir STOP Bed,
sir?”

“I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.”

“And then breakfast, sir STOP Yes, sir STOP That way, sir, if you please STOP Show Concord STOP Gentleman's valise and hot water to Concord STOP Pull off
gentleman's boots in Concord STOP (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir. STOP Fetch barber to Concord STOP Stir about there, now, for Concord!”

The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the
mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from
head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the
Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,
all kinds and varieties of men came out of it STOP Consequently, another
drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all
loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord
and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a
brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large
square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to
his breakfast STOP The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman
in brown STOP His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat,
with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still,
that he might have been sitting for his portrait STOP Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a
loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat,
as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
evanescence of the brisk fire STOP He had a good leg, and was a little vain
of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a
fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim STOP He
wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his
head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which
looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass STOP His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,
was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring
beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea STOP A
face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the
quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost
their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and
reserved expression of Tellson's Bank STOP He had a healthy colour in his
cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety STOP But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson's Bank were
principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps
second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on STOP Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,
Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep STOP The arrival of his breakfast roused him,
and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:

“I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any
time to-day STOP She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a
gentleman from Tellson's Bank STOP Please to let me know.”

“Yes, sir STOP Tellson's Bank in London, sir?”

“Yes.”

“Yes, sir STOP We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in
their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir STOP A
vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company's House.”

“Yes STOP We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.”

“Yes, sir STOP Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,
sir?”

“Not of late years STOP It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last
from France.”

“Indeed, sir STOP That was before my time here, sir STOP Before our people's
time here, sir STOP The George was in other hands at that time, sir.”

“I believe so.”

“But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and
Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen
years ago?”

“You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from
the truth.”

“Indeed, sir!”

Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the
table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left,
dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while
he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower STOP According to the
immemorial usage of waiters in all ages STOP When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on
the beach STOP The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away
from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine
ostrich STOP The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling
wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was
destruction STOP It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and
brought the coast down, madly STOP The air among the houses was of so strong
a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be
dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea STOP A little
fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by
night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide
made, and was near flood STOP Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,
sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable
that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter STOP As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been
at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became
again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry's thoughts seemed to cloud
too STOP When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting
his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging,
digging, digging, in the live red coals STOP A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no
harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work STOP Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last
glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is
ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has
got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow
street, and rumbled into the inn-yard STOP He set down his glass untouched STOP “This is Mam'selle!” said he STOP In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette
had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from
Tellson's STOP “So soon?”

Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none
then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson's
immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience STOP The gentleman from Tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his
glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen
wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette's apartment STOP It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black
horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables STOP These had been oiled and
oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room
were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep
graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected
from them until they were dug out STOP The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his
way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for
the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall
candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and
the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,
and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand STOP As
his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden
hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and
a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth
it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was
not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright
fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his
eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,
of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very
Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran
high STOP The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of
the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital
procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were
offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the
feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette STOP “Pray take a seat, sir.” In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a
little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed STOP “I kiss your hand, miss,” said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier
date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat STOP “I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that
some intelligence--or discovery--”

“The word is not material, miss; either word will do.”

“--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so
long dead--”

Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the
hospital procession of negro cupids STOP As if _they_ had any help for
anybody in their absurd baskets STOP “--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate
with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for
the purpose.”

“Myself.”

“As I was prepared to hear, sir.”

She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a
pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he
was than she STOP He made her another bow STOP “I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by
those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to
France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with
me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,
during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection STOP The
gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to
beg the favour of his waiting for me here.”

“I was happy,” said Mr. Lorry, “to be entrusted with the charge STOP I shall
be more happy to execute it.”

“Sir, I thank you indeed STOP I thank you very gratefully STOP It was told me
by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the
business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising
nature STOP I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a
strong and eager interest to know what they are.”

“Naturally,” said Mr. Lorry STOP “Yes--I--”

After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the
ears, “It is very difficult to begin.”

He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance STOP The young
forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty
and characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand,
as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing
shadow STOP “Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?”

“Am I not?” Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with
an argumentative smile STOP Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of
which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression
deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which
she had hitherto remained standing STOP He watched her as she mused, and the
moment she raised her eyes again, went on:

“In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you
as a young English lady, Miss Manette?”

“If you please, sir.”

“Miss Manette, I am a man of business STOP I have a business charge to
acquit myself of STOP In your reception of it, don't heed me any more than
if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else STOP I will, with
your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”

“Story!”

He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added,
in a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call
our connection our customers STOP He was a French gentleman; a scientific
gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.”

“Not of Beauvais?”

“Why, yes, of Beauvais STOP Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
gentleman was of Beauvais STOP Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
gentleman was of repute in Paris STOP I had the honour of knowing him there STOP Our relations were business relations, but confidential STOP I was at that
time in our French House, and had been--oh STOP twenty years.”

“At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?”

“I speak, miss, of twenty years ago STOP He married--an English lady--and
I was one of the trustees STOP His affairs, like the affairs of many other
French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson's hands STOP In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for
scores of our customers STOP These are mere business relations, miss;
there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like
sentiment STOP I have passed from one to another, in the course of my
business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in
the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere
machine STOP To go on--”

“But this is my father's story, sir; and I begin to think”--the
curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--“that when I was
left an orphan through my mother's surviving my father only two years,
it was you who brought me to England STOP I am almost sure it was you.”

Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips STOP He then
conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding
the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub
his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking
down into her face while she sat looking up into his STOP “Miss Manette, it _was_ I STOP And you will see how truly I spoke of myself
just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold
with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect
that I have never seen you since STOP No; you have been the ward of
Tellson's House since, and I have been busy with the other business of
Tellson's House since STOP Feelings STOP I have no time for them, no chance
of them STOP I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary
Mangle.”

After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry
flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most
unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was
before), and resumed his former attitude STOP “So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your
regretted father STOP Now comes the difference STOP If your father had not died
when he did--Don't be frightened STOP How you start!”

She did, indeed, start STOP And she caught his wrist with both her hands STOP “Pray,” said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from
the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped
him in so violent a tremble: “pray control your agitation--a matter of
business STOP As I was saying--”

Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:

“As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly
and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not
been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could
trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a
privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid
to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the
privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one
to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had
implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of
him, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have
been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.”

“I entreat you to tell me more, sir.”

“I will STOP I am going to STOP You can bear it?”

“I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this
moment.”

“You speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected STOP That's good!” (Though
his manner was less satisfied than his words. STOP “A matter of business STOP Regard it as a matter of business--business that must be done STOP Now
if this doctor's wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit,
had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was
born--”

“The little child was a daughter, sir.”

“A daughter STOP A-a-matter of business--don't be distressed STOP Miss, if the
poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,
that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the
inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by
rearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, don't kneel STOP In
Heaven's name why should you kneel to me!”

“For the truth STOP O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!”

“A--a matter of business STOP You confuse me, and how can I transact
business if I am confused STOP Let us be clear-headed STOP If you could kindly
mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many
shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging STOP I should be so
much more at my ease about your state of mind.”

Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had
very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she
communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry STOP “That's right, that's right STOP Courage STOP Business STOP You have business before
you; useful business STOP Miss Manette, your mother took this course with
you STOP And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened
her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old,
to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud
upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his
heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.”

As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the
flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have
been already tinged with grey STOP “You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what
they had was secured to your mother and to you STOP There has been no new
discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--”

He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped STOP The expression in the
forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was
now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror STOP “But he has been--been found STOP He is alive STOP Greatly changed, it is too
probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best STOP Still, alive STOP Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant
in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to
restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.”

A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his STOP She said, in a
low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,

“I am going to see his Ghost STOP It will be his Ghost--not him!”

Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm STOP “There, there,
there STOP See now, see now STOP The best and the worst are known to you, now STOP You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair
sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side.”

She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, “I have been free, I
have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!”

“Only one thing more,” said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a
wholesome means of enforcing her attention: “he has been found under
another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed STOP It would be
worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to
know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly
held prisoner STOP It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,
because it would be dangerous STOP Better not to mention the subject,
anywhere or in any way, and to remove him--for a while at all
events--out of France STOP Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even
Tellson's, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of
the matter STOP I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring
to it STOP This is a secret service altogether STOP My credentials, entries,
and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, 'Recalled to Life;'
which may mean anything STOP But what is the matter STOP She doesn't notice a
word STOP Miss Manette!”

Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she
sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed
upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or
branded into her forehead STOP So close was her hold upon his arm, that he
feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called
out loudly for assistance without moving STOP A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to
be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some
extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most
wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too,
or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the
inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the
poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him
flying back against the nearest wall STOP (“I really think this must be a man!” was Mr. Lorry's breathless
reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall. STOP “Why, look at you all!” bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants STOP “Why don't you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring
at me STOP I am not so much to look at, am I STOP Why don't you go and fetch
things STOP I'll let you know, if you don't bring smelling-salts, cold
water, and vinegar, quick, I will.”

There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she
softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and
gentleness: calling her “my precious!” and “my bird!” and spreading her
golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care STOP “And you in brown!” she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;
“couldn't you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her
to death STOP Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands STOP Do
you call _that_ being a Banker?”

Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler
sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn
servants under the mysterious penalty of “letting them know” something
not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a
regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head
upon her shoulder STOP “I hope she will do well now,” said Mr. Lorry STOP “No thanks to you in brown, if she does STOP My darling pretty!”

“I hope,” said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and
humility, “that you accompany Miss Manette to France?”

“A likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman STOP “If it was ever
intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence
would have cast my lot in an island?”

This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to
consider it STOP V. The Wine-shop


A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street STOP The
accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled
out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just
outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell STOP All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their
idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine STOP The rough, irregular
stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have
thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,
had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own
jostling group or crowd, according to its size STOP Some men kneeled down,
made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help
women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all
run out between their fingers STOP Others, men and women, dipped in
the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with
handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants'
mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;
others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and
there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new
directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed
pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted
fragments with eager relish STOP There was no drainage to carry off the
wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up
along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,
if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous
presence STOP A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,
and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted STOP There
was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness STOP There was a
special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part
of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the
luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,
shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen
together STOP When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been
most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these
demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out STOP The man who
had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in
motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of
hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own
starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men
with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into
the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom
gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine STOP The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street
in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled STOP It had
stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many
wooden shoes STOP The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks
on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was
stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again STOP Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a
tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his
head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled
upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD STOP The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the
street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there STOP And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary
gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was
heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in
waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;
but, most especially the last STOP Samples of a people that had undergone a
terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the
fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,
passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered
in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook STOP The mill which
had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the
children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the
grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,
was the sigh, Hunger STOP It was prevalent everywhere STOP Hunger was pushed out
of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and
lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and
paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of
firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless
chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,
among its refuse, of anything to eat STOP Hunger was the inscription on the
baker's shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of
bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that
was offered for sale STOP Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every
farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant
drops of oil STOP Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it STOP A narrow winding
street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets
diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags
and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them
that looked ill STOP In the hunted air of the people there was yet some
wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay STOP Depressed and
slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor
compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted
into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or
inflicting STOP The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)
were, all, grim illustrations of Want STOP The butcher and the porkman
painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of
meagre loaves STOP The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,
croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were
gloweringly confidential together STOP Nothing was represented in a
flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives
and axes were sharp and bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and the
gunmaker's stock was murderous STOP The crippling stones of the pavement,
with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but
broke off abruptly at the doors STOP The kennel, to make amends, ran down
the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy
rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses STOP Across
the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,
and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
manner overhead, as if they were at sea STOP Indeed they were at sea, and
the ship and crew were in peril of tempest STOP For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so
long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling
up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their
condition STOP But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over
France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of
song and feather, took no warning STOP The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its
appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside
it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle
for the lost wine STOP “It's not my affair,” said he, with a final shrug
of the shoulders STOP “The people from the market did it STOP Let them bring
another.”

There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,
he called to him across the way:

“Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?”

The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often
the way with his tribe STOP It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is
often the way with his tribe too STOP “What now STOP Are you a subject for the mad hospital?” said the wine-shop
keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of
mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it STOP “Why do you write
in the public streets STOP Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place
to write such words in?”

In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally,
perhaps not) upon the joker's heart STOP The joker rapped it with his
own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing
attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his
hand, and held out STOP A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly
practical character, he looked, under those circumstances STOP “Put it on, put it on,” said the other STOP “Call wine, wine; and finish
there.” With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker's
dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on
his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop STOP This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,
and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a
bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder STOP His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to
the elbows STOP Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own
crisply-curling short dark hair STOP He was a dark man altogether, with good
eyes and a good bold breadth between them STOP Good-humoured looking on
the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong
resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing
down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn
the man STOP Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he
came in STOP Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with
a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand
heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of
manner STOP There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might
have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself
in any of the reckonings over which she presided STOP Madame Defarge being
sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright
shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large
earrings STOP Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick
her teeth with a toothpick STOP Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported
by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but
coughed just one grain of cough STOP This, in combination with the lifting
of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while
he stepped over the way STOP The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in
a corner STOP Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing
dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
of wine STOP As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the
elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, “This is our man.”

“What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?” said Monsieur Defarge
to himself; “I don't know you.”

But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse
with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter STOP “How goes it, Jacques?” said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge STOP “Is
all the spilt wine swallowed?”

“Every drop, Jacques,” answered Monsieur Defarge STOP When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,
picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,
and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line STOP “It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur
Defarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or
of anything but black bread and death STOP Is it not so, Jacques?”

“It is so, Jacques,” Monsieur Defarge returned STOP At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still
using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of
cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line STOP The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty
drinking vessel and smacked his lips STOP “Ah STOP So much the worse STOP A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques STOP Am I
right, Jacques?”

“You are right, Jacques,” was the response of Monsieur Defarge STOP This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment
when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and
slightly rustled in her seat STOP “Hold then STOP True!” muttered her husband STOP “Gentlemen--my wife!”

The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three
flourishes STOP She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and
giving them a quick look STOP Then she glanced in a casual manner round the
wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
of spirit, and became absorbed in it STOP “Gentlemen,” said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly
upon her, “good day STOP The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you
wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the
fifth floor STOP The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of
my establishment STOP But, now that I remember, one of you has already been
there, and can show the way STOP Gentlemen, adieu!”

They paid for their wine, and left the place STOP The eyes of Monsieur
Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly
gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word STOP “Willingly, sir,” said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to
the door STOP Their conference was very short, but very decided STOP Almost at the first
word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive STOP It had
not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out STOP The gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out STOP Madame Defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing STOP Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,
joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own
company just before STOP It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,
and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited
by a great number of people STOP In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the
gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee
to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips STOP It was
a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable
transformation had come over him in a few seconds STOP He had no good-humour
in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,
angry, dangerous man STOP “It is very high; it is a little difficult STOP Better to begin slowly.”
 Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began
ascending the stairs STOP “Is he alone?” the latter whispered STOP “Alone STOP God help him, who should be with him!” said the other, in the
same low voice STOP “Is he always alone, then?”

“Yes.”

“Of his own desire?”

“Of his own necessity STOP As he was, when I first saw him after they
found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be
discreet--as he was then, so he is now.”

“He is greatly changed?”

“Changed!”

The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,
and mutter a tremendous curse STOP No direct answer could have been half so
forcible STOP Mr. Lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his
two companions ascended higher and higher STOP Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded
parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile
indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses STOP Every little habitation
within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,
the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general
staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides
flinging other refuse from its own windows STOP The uncontrollable and
hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted
the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their
intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost
insupportable STOP Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt
and poison, the way lay STOP Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to
his young companion's agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.
Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest STOP Each of these stoppages was made
at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left
uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed
to crawl in STOP Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were
caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer
or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any
promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations STOP At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the
third time STOP There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination
and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story
was reached STOP The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in
advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he
dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about
here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over
his shoulder, took out a key STOP “The door is locked then, my friend?” said Mr. Lorry, surprised STOP “Ay STOP Yes,” was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge STOP “You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”

“I think it necessary to turn the key.” Monsieur Defarge whispered it
closer in his ear, and frowned heavily STOP “Why?”

“Why STOP Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be
frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what
harm--if his door was left open.”

“Is it possible!” exclaimed Mr. Lorry STOP “Is it possible!” repeated Defarge, bitterly STOP “Yes STOP And a beautiful
world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things
are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under
that sky there, every day STOP Long live the Devil STOP Let us go on.”

This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word
of it had reached the young lady's ears STOP But, by this time she trembled
under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,
and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent
on him to speak a word or two of reassurance STOP “Courage, dear miss STOP Courage STOP Business STOP The worst will be over in a
moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over STOP Then,
all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you
bring to him, begin STOP Let our good friend here, assist you on that side STOP That's well, friend Defarge STOP Come, now STOP Business, business!”

They went up slowly and softly STOP The staircase was short, and they were
soon at the top STOP There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at
once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at
the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which
the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall STOP On hearing
footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed
themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the
wine-shop STOP “I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained Monsieur
Defarge STOP “Leave us, good boys; we have business here.”

The three glided by, and went silently down STOP There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of
the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.
Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:

“Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?”

“I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”

“Is that well?”

“_I_ think it is well.”

“Who are the few STOP How do you choose them?”

“I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the
sight is likely to do good STOP Enough; you are English; that is another
thing STOP Stay there, if you please, a little moment.”

With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in
through the crevice in the wall STOP Soon raising his head again, he struck
twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to
make a noise there STOP With the same intention, he drew the key across it,
three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned
it as heavily as he could STOP The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the
room and said something STOP A faint voice answered something STOP Little more
than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side STOP He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter STOP Mr. Lorry
got his arm securely round the daughter's waist, and held her; for he
felt that she was sinking STOP “A-a-a-business, business!” he urged, with a moisture that was not of
business shining on his cheek STOP “Come in, come in!”

“I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering STOP “Of it STOP What?”

“I mean of him STOP Of my father.”

Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of
their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room STOP He sat her
down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him STOP Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,
took out the key again, and held it in his hand STOP All this he did,
methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he
could make STOP Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to
where the window was STOP He stopped there, and faced round STOP The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim
and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the
roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any
other door of French construction STOP To exclude the cold, one half of this
door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way STOP Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it
was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit
alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work
requiring nicety in such obscurity STOP Yet, work of that kind was being
done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face
towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at
him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very
busy, making shoes STOP VI STOP The Shoemaker


“Good day!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that
bent low over the shoemaking STOP It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the
salutation, as if it were at a distance:

“Good day!”

“You are still hard at work, I see?”

After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the
voice replied, “Yes--I am working.” This time, a pair of haggard eyes
had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again STOP The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful STOP It was not the
faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no
doubt had their part in it STOP Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was
the faintness of solitude and disuse STOP It was like the last feeble echo
of a sound made long and long ago STOP So entirely had it lost the life and
resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once
beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain STOP So sunken and
suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground STOP So expressive
it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,
wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered
home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die STOP Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked
up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical
perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were
aware of had stood, was not yet empty STOP “I want,” said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,
“to let in a little more light here STOP You can bear a little more?”

The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,
at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the
other side of him; then, upward at the speaker STOP “What did you say?”

“You can bear a little more light?”

“I must bear it, if you let it in.” (Laying the palest shadow of a
stress upon the second word. STOP The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that
angle for the time STOP A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and
showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his
labour STOP His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his
feet and on his bench STOP He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very
long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes STOP The hollowness and
thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet
dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really
otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so STOP His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body
to be withered and worn STOP He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose
stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion
from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of
parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which STOP He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones
of it seemed transparent STOP So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,
pausing in his work STOP He never looked at the figure before him, without
first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had
lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without
first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak STOP “Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?” asked Defarge,
motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward STOP “What did you say?”

“Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?”

“I can't say that I mean to STOP I suppose so STOP I don't know.”

But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again STOP Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door STOP When
he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker
looked up STOP He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the
unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then
the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe STOP The
look and the action had occupied but an instant STOP “You have a visitor, you see,” said Monsieur Defarge STOP “What did you say?”

“Here is a visitor.”

The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his
work STOP “Come!” said Defarge STOP “Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when
he sees one STOP Show him that shoe you are working at STOP Take it, monsieur.”

Mr. Lorry took it in his hand STOP “Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name.”

There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:

“I forget what it was you asked me STOP What did you say?”

“I said, couldn't you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur's
information?”

“It is a lady's shoe STOP It is a young lady's walking-shoe STOP It is in the
present mode STOP I never saw the mode STOP I have had a pattern in my hand.” He
glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride STOP “And the maker's name?” said Defarge STOP Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand
in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the
hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and
so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission STOP The task of
recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he
had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or
endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a
fast-dying man STOP “Did you ask me for my name?”

“Assuredly I did.”

“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”

“Is that all?”

“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”

With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work
again, until the silence was again broken STOP “You are not a shoemaker by trade?” said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly
at him STOP His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the
question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back
on the questioner when they had sought the ground STOP “I am not a shoemaker by trade STOP No, I was not a shoemaker by trade STOP I-I
learnt it here STOP I taught myself STOP I asked leave to--”

He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his
hands the whole time STOP His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face
from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and
resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a
subject of last night STOP “I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after
a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.”

As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr.
Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:

“Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?”

The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the
questioner STOP “Monsieur Manette”; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge's arm; “do you
remember nothing of this man STOP Look at him STOP Look at me STOP Is there no old
banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your
mind, Monsieur Manette?”

As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.
Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves
through the black mist that had fallen on him STOP They were overclouded
again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there STOP And
so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who
had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where
she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only
raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and
shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,
trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression
repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it
looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her STOP Darkness had fallen on him in its place STOP He looked at the two, less and
less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground
and looked about him in the old way STOP Finally, with a deep long sigh, he
took the shoe up, and resumed his work STOP “Have you recognised him, monsieur?” asked Defarge in a whisper STOP “Yes; for a moment STOP At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have
unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so
well STOP Hush STOP Let us draw further back STOP Hush!”

She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on
which he sat STOP There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped
over his labour STOP Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made STOP She stood, like a spirit,
beside him, and he bent over his work STOP It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument
in his hand, for his shoemaker's knife STOP It lay on that side of him
which was not the side on which she stood STOP He had taken it up, and was
stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress STOP He
raised them, and saw her face STOP The two spectators started forward,
but she stayed them with a motion of her hand STOP She had no fear of his
striking at her with the knife, though they had STOP He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began
to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them STOP By degrees, in
the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:

“What is this?”

With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her
lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she
laid his ruined head there STOP “You are not the gaoler's daughter?”

She sighed “No.”

“Who are you?”

Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench
beside him STOP He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm STOP A strange
thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he
laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her STOP Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed
aside, and fell down over her neck STOP Advancing his hand by little and
little, he took it up and looked at it STOP In the midst of the action
he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his
shoemaking STOP But not for long STOP Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his
shoulder STOP After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to
be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand
to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag
attached to it STOP He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained
a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden
hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger STOP He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it STOP “It is
the same STOP How can it be STOP When was it STOP How was it!”

As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to
become conscious that it was in hers too STOP He turned her full to the
light, and looked at her STOP “She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned
out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was
brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve STOP 'You will
leave me them STOP They can never help me to escape in the body, though they
may in the spirit. STOP Those were the words I said STOP I remember them very
well.”

He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it STOP But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently,
though slowly STOP “How was this?--_Was it you_?”

Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a
frightful suddenness STOP But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only
said, in a low voice, “I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near
us, do not speak, do not move!”

“Hark!” he exclaimed STOP “Whose voice was that?”

His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white
hair, which they tore in a frenzy STOP It died out, as everything but his
shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and
tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and
gloomily shook his head STOP “No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming STOP It can't be STOP See what the
prisoner is STOP These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face
she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard STOP No, no STOP She was--and He
was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago STOP What is your
name, my gentle angel?”

Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees
before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast STOP “O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,
and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history STOP But I
cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here STOP All that I may
tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless
me STOP Kiss me, kiss me STOP O my dear, my dear!”

His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and
lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him STOP “If you hear in my voice--I don't know that it is so, but I hope it
is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was
sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it STOP If you touch, in
touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your
breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it STOP If, when
I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you
with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the
remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away,
weep for it, weep for it!”

She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a
child STOP “If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I
have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at
peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,
and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it STOP And
if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,
and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my
honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake
striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of
my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it STOP Weep
for her, then, and for me STOP Good gentlemen, thank God STOP I feel his sacred
tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart STOP O, see STOP Thank
God for us, thank God!”

He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so
touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which
had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces STOP When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving
breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all
storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm
called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and
daughter from the ground STOP He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay
there in a lethargy, worn out STOP She had nestled down with him, that his
head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained
him from the light STOP “If, without disturbing him,” she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as
he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, “all could be
arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he
could be taken away--”

“But, consider STOP Is he fit for the journey?” asked Mr. Lorry STOP “More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to
him.”

“It is true,” said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear STOP “More
than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France STOP Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?”

“That's business,” said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his
methodical manners; “and if business is to be done, I had better do it.”

“Then be so kind,” urged Miss Manette, “as to leave us here STOP You see how
composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me
now STOP Why should you be STOP If you will lock the door to secure us from
interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back,
as quiet as you leave him STOP In any case, I will take care of him until
you return, and then we will remove him straight.”

Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and
in favour of one of them remaining STOP But, as there were not only carriage
and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed,
for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily
dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away
to do it STOP Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the
hard ground close at the father's side, and watched him STOP The darkness
deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed
through the chinks in the wall STOP Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and
had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and
meat, wine, and hot coffee STOP Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the
lamp he carried, on the shoemaker's bench (there was nothing else in the
garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and
assisted him to his feet STOP No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in
the scared blank wonder of his face STOP Whether he knew what had happened,
whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that
he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved STOP They
tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to
answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for
the time to tamper with him no more STOP He had a wild, lost manner of
occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen
in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his
daughter's voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke STOP In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he
ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak
and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear STOP He readily responded to
his daughter's drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand
in both his own STOP They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr.
Lorry closing the little procession STOP They had not traversed many steps
of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and
round at the walls STOP “You remember the place, my father STOP You remember coming up here?”

“What did you say?”

But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if
she had repeated it STOP “Remember STOP No, I don't remember STOP It was so very long ago.”

That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his
prison to that house, was apparent to them STOP They heard him mutter,
“One Hundred and Five, North Tower;” and when he looked about him, it
evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed
him STOP On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his
tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was
no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he
dropped his daughter's hand and clasped his head again STOP No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the
many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street STOP An unnatural
silence and desertion reigned there STOP Only one soul was to be seen, and
that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and
saw nothing STOP The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed
him, when Mr. Lorry's feet were arrested on the step by his asking,
miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes STOP Madame
Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and
went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard STOP She quickly
brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned
against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing STOP Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word “To the Barrier!” The
postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble
over-swinging lamps STOP Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better
streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds,
illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city
gates STOP Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there STOP “Your papers,
travellers!” “See here then, Monsieur the Officer,” said Defarge,
getting down, and taking him gravely apart, “these are the papers of
monsieur inside, with the white head STOP They were consigned to me, with
him, at the--” He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the
military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm
in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day
or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head STOP “It is well STOP Forward!” from the uniform STOP “Adieu!” from Defarge STOP And so, under a short
grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great
grove of stars STOP Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from
this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything
is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black STOP All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more
whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried
man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever
lost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:

“I hope you care to be recalled to life?”

And the old answer:

“I can't say.”


The end of the first book STOP Book the Second--the Golden Thread




I STOP Five Years Later


Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the
year one thousand seven hundred and eighty STOP It was very small, very
dark, very ugly, very incommodious STOP It was an old-fashioned place,
moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were
proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,
proud of its incommodiousness STOP They were even boastful of its eminence
in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if
it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable STOP This was
no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more
convenient places of business STOP Tellson's (they said) wanted
no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no
embellishment STOP Noakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but
Tellson's, thank Heaven-- STOP Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the
question of rebuilding Tellson's STOP In this respect the House was much
on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for
suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
objectionable, but were only the more respectable STOP Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection
of inconvenience STOP After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with
a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps,
and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little
counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of
windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,
and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the
heavy shadow of Temple Bar STOP If your business necessitated your seeing
“the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,
where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its
hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal
twilight STOP Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden
drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when
they were opened and shut STOP Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they
were fast decomposing into rags again STOP Your plate was stowed away among
the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good
polish in a day or two STOP Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms
made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their
parchments into the banking-house air STOP Your lighter boxes of family
papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great
dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year
one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you
by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released
from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads
exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of
Abyssinia or Ashantee STOP But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's STOP Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's STOP Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note
was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the
purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder
of a horse at Tellson's door, who made off with it, was put to
Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of
three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to
Death STOP Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it
might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the
reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each
particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked
after STOP Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business,
its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid
low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately
disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the
ground floor had, in a rather significant manner STOP Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson's, the
oldest of men carried on the business gravely STOP When they took a young
man into Tellson's London house, they hid him somewhere till he was
old STOP They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full
Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him STOP Then only was he permitted to
be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches
and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment STOP Outside Tellson's--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an
odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live
sign of the house STOP He was never absent during business hours, unless
upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin
of twelve, who was his express image STOP People understood that Tellson's,
in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man STOP The house had always
tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted
this person to the post STOP His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful
occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the
easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added
appellation of Jerry STOP The scene was Mr. Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley,
Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March
morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty STOP (Mr. Cruncher himself
always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under
the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a
popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it. STOP Mr. Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were
but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it
might be counted as one STOP But they were very decently kept STOP Early as
it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was
already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged
for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth
was spread STOP Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin
at home STOP At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll
and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair
looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons STOP At which juncture, he
exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:

“Bust me, if she ain't at it agin!”

A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a
corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the
person referred to STOP “What!” said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot STOP “You're at it
agin, are you?”

After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at
the woman as a third STOP It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the
odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher's domestic economy, that,
whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he
often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay STOP “What,” said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his
mark--“what are you up to, Aggerawayter?”

“I was only saying my prayers.”

“Saying your prayers STOP You're a nice woman STOP What do you mean by flopping
yourself down and praying agin me?”

“I was not praying against you; I was praying for you.”

“You weren't STOP And if you were, I won't be took the liberty with STOP Here STOP your mother's a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your
father's prosperity STOP You've got a dutiful mother, you have, my son STOP You've got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping
herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out
of the mouth of her only child.”

Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning
to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal
board STOP “And what do you suppose, you conceited female,” said Mr. Cruncher, with
unconscious inconsistency, “that the worth of _your_ prayers may be STOP Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at!”

“They only come from the heart, Jerry STOP They are worth no more than
that.”

“Worth no more than that,” repeated Mr. Cruncher STOP “They ain't worth
much, then STOP Whether or no, I won't be prayed agin, I tell you STOP I can't
afford it STOP I'm not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking STOP If
you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and
child, and not in opposition to 'em STOP If I had had any but a unnat'ral
wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat'ral mother, I might
have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and
countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck STOP B-u-u-ust me!” said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting
on his clothes, “if I ain't, what with piety and one blowed thing and
another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor
devil of a honest tradesman met with STOP Young Jerry, dress yourself, my
boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and
then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call STOP For, I
tell you,” here he addressed his wife once more, “I won't be gone agin,
in this manner STOP I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I'm as sleepy as
laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn't know, if
it wasn't for the pain in 'em, which was me and which somebody else, yet
I'm none the better for it in pocket; and it's my suspicion that you've
been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for
it in pocket, and I won't put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you
say now!”

Growling, in addition, such phrases as “Ah STOP yes STOP You're religious, too STOP You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband
and child, would you STOP Not you!” and throwing off other sarcastic sparks
from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook
himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business STOP In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes,
and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father's did,
kept the required watch upon his mother STOP He greatly disturbed that poor
woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made
his toilet, with a suppressed cry of “You are going to flop, mother STOP --Halloa, father!” and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in
again with an undutiful grin STOP Mr. Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his
breakfast STOP He resented Mrs. Cruncher's saying grace with particular
animosity STOP “Now, Aggerawayter STOP What are you up to STOP At it again?”

His wife explained that she had merely “asked a blessing.”

“Don't do it!” said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected
to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife's petitions STOP “I
ain't a going to be blest out of house and home STOP I won't have my wittles
blest off my table STOP Keep still!”

Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party
which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried
his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed
inmate of a menagerie STOP Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled
aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as
he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation
of the day STOP It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite
description of himself as “a honest tradesman.” His stock consisted of
a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool,
young Jerry, walking at his father's side, carried every morning to
beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where,
with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned
from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man's
feet, it formed the encampment for the day STOP On this post of his, Mr.
Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar
itself,--and was almost as in-looking STOP Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his
three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson's,
Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry
standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to
inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing
boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose STOP Father and son,
extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic
in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two
eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys STOP The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that
the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the
youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else
in Fleet-street STOP The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson's
establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:

“Porter wanted!”

“Hooray, father STOP Here's an early job to begin with!”

Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on
the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father
had been chewing, and cogitated STOP “Al-ways rusty STOP His fingers is al-ways rusty!” muttered young Jerry STOP “Where does my father get all that iron rust from STOP He don't get no iron
rust here!”




II STOP A Sight


“You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?” said one of the oldest of
clerks to Jerry the messenger STOP “Ye-es, sir,” returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner STOP “I _do_
know the Bailey.”

“Just so STOP And you know Mr. Lorry.”

“I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey STOP Much
better,” said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment
in question, “than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.”

“Very well STOP Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the
door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry STOP He will then let you in.”

“Into the court, sir?”

“Into the court.”

Mr. Cruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to
interchange the inquiry, “What do you think of this?”

“Am I to wait in the court, sir?” he asked, as the result of that
conference STOP “I am going to tell you STOP The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.
Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry's
attention, and show him where you stand STOP Then what you have to do, is,
to remain there until he wants you.”

“Is that all, sir?”

“That's all STOP He wishes to have a messenger at hand STOP This is to tell him
you are there.”

As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,
Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the
blotting-paper stage, remarked:

“I suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning?”

“Treason!”

“That's quartering,” said Jerry STOP “Barbarous!”

“It is the law,” remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised
spectacles upon him STOP “It is the law.”

“It's hard in the law to spile a man, I think STOP It's hard enough to kill
him, but it's wery hard to spile him, sir.”

“Not at all,” retained the ancient clerk STOP “Speak well of the law STOP Take
care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take
care of itself STOP I give you that advice.”

“It's the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,” said Jerry STOP “I
leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.”

“Well, well,” said the old clerk; “we all have our various ways of
gaining a livelihood STOP Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry
ways STOP Here is the letter STOP Go along.”

Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal
deference than he made an outward show of, “You are a lean old one,
too,” made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination,
and went his way STOP They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had
not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it STOP But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and
villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came
into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the
dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench STOP It
had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced
his own doom as certainly as the prisoner's, and even died before him STOP For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,
from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on
a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a
half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any STOP So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning STOP It
was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted
a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for
the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and
softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in
blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically
leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
under Heaven STOP Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice
illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right;” an aphorism
that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome
consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong STOP Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this
hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his
way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in
his letter through a trap in it STOP For, people then paid to see the play
at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the
former entertainment was much the dearer STOP Therefore, all the Old Bailey
doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the
criminals got there, and those were always left wide open STOP After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a
very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into
court STOP “What's on?” he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next
to STOP “Nothing yet.”

“What's coming on?”

“The Treason case.”

“The quartering one, eh?”

“Ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he'll be drawn on a hurdle to
be half hanged, and then he'll be taken down and sliced before his own
face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on,
and then his head will be chopped off, and he'll be cut into quarters STOP That's the sentence.”

“If he's found Guilty, you mean to say?” Jerry added, by way of proviso STOP “Oh STOP they'll find him guilty,” said the other STOP “Don't you be afraid of
that.”

Mr. Cruncher's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he
saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand STOP Mr. Lorry
sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged
gentleman, the prisoner's counsel, who had a great bundle of papers
before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands
in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him
then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the
court STOP After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing
with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up
to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again STOP “What's _he_ got to do with the case?” asked the man he had spoken with STOP “Blest if I know,” said Jerry STOP “What have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?”

“Blest if I know that either,” said Jerry STOP The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling
down in the court, stopped the dialogue STOP Presently, the dock became the
central point of interest STOP Two gaolers, who had been standing there,
went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar STOP Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the
ceiling, stared at him STOP All the human breath in the place, rolled
at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire STOP Eager faces strained round
pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows
stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court,
laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help
themselves, at anybody's cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got
upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him STOP Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall
of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a
whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with
the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not,
that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him
in an impure mist and rain STOP The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about
five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and
a dark eye STOP His condition was that of a young gentleman STOP He was plainly
dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and
dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out
of his way than for ornament STOP As an emotion of the mind will express
itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his
situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the
soul to be stronger than the sun STOP He was otherwise quite self-possessed,
bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet STOP The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at,
was not a sort that elevated humanity STOP Had he stood in peril of a less
horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage
details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his
fascination STOP The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,
was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
and torn asunder, yielded the sensation STOP Whatever gloss the various
spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and
powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish STOP Silence in the court STOP Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to
an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that
he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so
forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers
occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French
King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and
so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of
our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the
said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise
evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our
said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation
to send to Canada and North America STOP This much, Jerry, with his head
becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with
huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that
the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood
there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and
that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak STOP The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged,
beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from
the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it STOP He was quiet and
attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;
and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so
composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
it was strewn STOP The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with
vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever STOP Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror, to throw the light down
upon him STOP Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in
it, and had passed from its surface and this earth's together STOP Haunted
in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the
glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one
day to give up its dead STOP Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace
for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner's mind STOP Be
that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar
of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his
face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away STOP It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court
which was on his left STOP About on a level with his eyes, there sat,
in that corner of the Judge's bench, two persons upon whom his look
immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his
aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them STOP The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than
twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very
remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair,
and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,
but pondering and self-communing STOP When this expression was upon him, he
looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as
it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a
handsome man, not past the prime of life STOP His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by
him, and the other pressed upon it STOP She had drawn close to him, in her
dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner STOP Her forehead had
been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion
that saw nothing but the peril of the accused STOP This had been so very
noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who
had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about,
“Who are they?”

Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own
manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his
absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were STOP The crowd about
him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and
from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got
to Jerry:

“Witnesses.”

“For which side?”

“Against.”

“Against what side?”

“The prisoner's.”

The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them,
leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was
in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the
axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold STOP III STOP A Disappointment


Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before
them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which
claimed the forfeit of his life STOP That this correspondence with the
public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or
even of last year, or of the year before STOP That, it was certain the
prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and
repassing between France and England, on secret business of which
he could give no honest account STOP That, if it were in the nature of
traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real
wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered STOP That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who
was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the
prisoner's schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his
Majesty's Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council STOP That, this patriot would be produced before them STOP That, his position and
attitude were, on the whole, sublime STOP That, he had been the prisoner's
friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his
infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish
in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country STOP That, if statues
were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public
benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one STOP That, as
they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one STOP That, Virtue,
as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well
knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues;
whereat the jury's countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that
they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more
especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country STOP That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness
for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had
communicated itself to the prisoner's servant, and had engendered in him
a holy determination to examine his master's table-drawers and pockets,
and secrete his papers STOP That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to
hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,
in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General's)
brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.
Attorney-General's) father and mother STOP That, he called with confidence
on the jury to come and do likewise STOP That, the evidence of these two
witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be
produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of
his Majesty's forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by
sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed
such information to a hostile power STOP That, these lists could not be
proved to be in the prisoner's handwriting; but that it was all the
same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as
showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions STOP That, the proof
would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged
in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the
very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans STOP That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they
were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must
positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether
they liked it or not STOP That, they never could lay their heads upon their
pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying
their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion
of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that
there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon
pillows at all, unless the prisoner's head was taken off STOP That head
Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of
everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith
of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as
good as dead and gone STOP When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if
a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in
anticipation of what he was soon to become STOP When toned down again, the
unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box STOP Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader's lead, examined the
patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name STOP The story of his pure soul was
exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if
it had a fault, a little too exactly STOP Having released his noble bosom
of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the
wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr.
Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions STOP The wigged gentleman sitting
opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court STOP Had he ever been a spy himself STOP No, he scorned the base insinuation STOP What did he live upon STOP His property STOP Where was his property STOP He didn't
precisely remember where it was STOP What was it STOP No business of anybody's STOP Had he inherited it STOP Yes, he had STOP From whom STOP Distant relation STOP Very
distant STOP Rather STOP Ever been in prison STOP Certainly not STOP Never in a debtors'
prison STOP Didn't see what that had to do with it STOP Never in a debtors'
prison?--Come, once again STOP Never STOP Yes STOP How many times STOP Two or three
times STOP Not five or six STOP Perhaps STOP Of what profession STOP Gentleman STOP Ever
been kicked STOP Might have been STOP Frequently STOP No STOP Ever kicked downstairs STOP Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell
downstairs of his own accord STOP Kicked on that occasion for cheating at
dice STOP Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who
committed the assault, but it was not true STOP Swear it was not true STOP Positively STOP Ever live by cheating at play STOP Never STOP Ever live by play STOP Not
more than other gentlemen do STOP Ever borrow money of the prisoner STOP Yes STOP Ever pay him STOP No STOP Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a
very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets STOP No STOP Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists STOP Certain STOP Knew no more
about the lists STOP No STOP Had not procured them himself, for instance STOP No STOP Expect to get anything by this evidence STOP No STOP Not in regular government
pay and employment, to lay traps STOP Oh dear no STOP Or to do anything STOP Oh dear
no STOP Swear that STOP Over and over again STOP No motives but motives of sheer
patriotism STOP None whatever STOP The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a
great rate STOP He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and
simplicity, four years ago STOP He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais
packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him STOP He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
charity--never thought of such a thing STOP He began to have suspicions of
the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards STOP In arranging
his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the
prisoner's pockets, over and over again STOP He had taken these lists from
the drawer of the prisoner's desk STOP He had not put them there first STOP He
had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen
at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and
Boulogne STOP He loved his country, and couldn't bear it, and had given
information STOP He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;
he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be
only a plated one STOP He had known the last witness seven or eight years;
that was merely a coincidence STOP He didn't call it a particularly curious
coincidence; most coincidences were curious STOP Neither did he call it a
curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too STOP He
was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him STOP The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis
Lorry STOP “Mr STOP Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson's bank?”

“I am.”

“On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and
Dover by the mail?”

“It did.”

“Were there any other passengers in the mail?”

“Two.”

“Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?”

“They did.”

“Mr STOP Lorry, look upon the prisoner STOP Was he one of those two passengers?”

“I cannot undertake to say that he was.”

“Does he resemble either of these two passengers?”

“Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so
reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.”

“Mr STOP Lorry, look again upon the prisoner STOP Supposing him wrapped up as
those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to
render it unlikely that he was one of them?”

“No.”

“You will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?”

“No.”

“So at least you say he may have been one of them?”

“Yes STOP Except that I remember them both to have been--like
myself--timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous
air.”

“Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?”

“I certainly have seen that.”

“Mr STOP Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner STOP Have you seen him, to your
certain knowledge, before?”

“I have.”

“When?”

“I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the
prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the
voyage with me.”

“At what hour did he come on board?”

“At a little after midnight.”

“In the dead of the night STOP Was he the only passenger who came on board
at that untimely hour?”

“He happened to be the only one.”

“Never mind about 'happening,' Mr. Lorry STOP He was the only passenger who
came on board in the dead of the night?”

“He was.”

“Were you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?”

“With two companions STOP A gentleman and lady STOP They are here.”

“They are here STOP Had you any conversation with the prisoner?”

“Hardly any STOP The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and
I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.”

“Miss Manette!”

The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now
turned again, stood up where she had sat STOP Her father rose with her, and
kept her hand drawn through his arm STOP “Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner.”

To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was
far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd STOP Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all
the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him
to remain quite still STOP His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs
before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts
to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour
rushed to his heart STOP The buzz of the great flies was loud again STOP “Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Where?”

“On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same
occasion.”

“You are the young lady just now referred to?”

“O STOP most unhappily, I am!”

The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice
of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: “Answer the questions put
to you, and make no remark upon them.”

“Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
passage across the Channel?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Recall it.”

In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: “When the
gentleman came on board--”

“Do you mean the prisoner?” inquired the Judge, knitting his brows STOP “Yes, my Lord.”

“Then say the prisoner.”

“When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,” turning
her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, “was much fatigued
and in a very weak state of health STOP My father was so reduced that I was
afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the
deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take
care of him STOP There were no other passengers that night, but we four STOP The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could
shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done STOP I
had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would
set when we were out of the harbour STOP He did it for me STOP He expressed
great gentleness and kindness for my father's state, and I am sure he
felt it STOP That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.”

“Let me interrupt you for a moment STOP Had he come on board alone?”

“No.”

“How many were with him?”

“Two French gentlemen.”

“Had they conferred together?”

“They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was
necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.”

“Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?”

“Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don't know what
papers.”

“Like these in shape and size?”

“Possibly, but indeed I don't know, although they stood whispering very
near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the
light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they
spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that
they looked at papers.”

“Now, to the prisoner's conversation, Miss Manette.”

“The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me--which arose out
of my helpless situation--as he was kind, and good, and useful to my
father STOP I hope,” bursting into tears, “I may not repay him by doing him
harm to-day.”

Buzzing from the blue-flies STOP “Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must
give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness,
he is the only person present in that condition STOP Please to go on.”

“He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and
difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was
therefore travelling under an assumed name STOP He said that this business
had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals,
take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long
time to come.”

“Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette STOP Be particular.”

“He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said
that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on
England's part STOP He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George
Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the
Third STOP But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said
laughingly, and to beguile the time.”

Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in
a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be
unconsciously imitated by the spectators STOP Her forehead was painfully
anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when
she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon
the counsel for and against STOP Among the lookers-on there was the same
expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority
of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness,
when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
heresy about George Washington STOP Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it
necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady's
father, Doctor Manette STOP Who was called accordingly STOP “Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner STOP Have you ever seen him before?”

“Once STOP When he called at my lodgings in London STOP Some three years, or
three years and a half ago.”

“Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or
speak to his conversation with your daughter?”

“Sir, I can do neither.”

“Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do
either?”

He answered, in a low voice, “There is.”

“Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without
trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?”

He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, “A long imprisonment.”

“Were you newly released on the occasion in question?”

“They tell me so.”

“Have you no remembrance of the occasion?”

“None STOP My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what
time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the
time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter
here STOP She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored
my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become
familiar STOP I have no remembrance of the process.”

Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down
together STOP A singular circumstance then arose in the case STOP The object in hand being
to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked,
in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and
got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did
not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more,
to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness
was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required,
in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town,
waiting for another person STOP The prisoner's counsel was cross-examining
this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner
on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time
been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a
little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him STOP Opening
this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great
attention and curiosity at the prisoner STOP “You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?”

The witness was quite sure STOP “Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?”

Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken STOP “Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,” pointing
to him who had tossed the paper over, “and then look well upon the
prisoner STOP How say you STOP Are they very like each other?”

Allowing for my learned friend's appearance being careless and slovenly
if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise,
not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought
into comparison STOP My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became
much more remarkable STOP My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisoner's
counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned
friend) for treason STOP But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he
would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might
happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so
confident, having seen it; and more STOP The upshot of which, was, to smash
this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to
useless lumber STOP Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
fingers in his following of the evidence STOP He had now to attend while Mr.
Stryver fitted the prisoner's case on the jury, like a compact suit
of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and
traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest
scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look
rather like STOP How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner,
and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family
affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making
those passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a
consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him,
even for his life, to disclose STOP How the evidence that had been warped
and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they
had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent
gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that
reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and
impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke STOP How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies
and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it;
how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous
character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the
State Trials of this country were full STOP But, there my Lord interposed
(with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could
not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions STOP Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to
attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr.
Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and
Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the
prisoner a hundred times worse STOP Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning
the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole
decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner STOP And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again STOP Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,
changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement STOP While his learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him,
whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced
anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and
grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat,
and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion
in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man
sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put
on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his
hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all
day STOP Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him
a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he
undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness,
when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the
lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would
hardly have thought the two were so alike STOP Mr. Cruncher made the
observation to his next neighbour, and added, “I'd hold half a guinea
that _he_ don't get no law-work to do STOP Don't look like the sort of one
to get any, do he?”

Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette's head dropped upon
her father's breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly:
“Officer STOP look to that young lady STOP Help the gentleman to take her out STOP Don't you see she will fall!”

There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much
sympathy with her father STOP It had evidently been a great distress to
him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled STOP He had shown
strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or
brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,
ever since STOP As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a
moment, spoke, through their foreman STOP They were not agreed, and wished to retire STOP My Lord (perhaps with George
Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed,
but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward,
and retired himself STOP The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in
the court were now being lighted STOP It began to be rumoured that the
jury would be out a long while STOP The spectators dropped off to get
refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat
down STOP Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out,
now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest,
could easily get near him STOP “Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can STOP But, keep in the
way STOP You will be sure to hear when the jury come in STOP Don't be a moment
behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank STOP You
are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long
before I can.”

Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in
acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling STOP Mr. Carton came up
at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm STOP “How is the young lady?”

“She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she
feels the better for being out of court.”

“I'll tell the prisoner so STOP It won't do for a respectable bank gentleman
like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.”

Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point
in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar STOP The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all
eyes, ears, and spikes STOP “Mr STOP Darnay!”

The prisoner came forward directly STOP “You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette STOP She
will do very well STOP You have seen the worst of her agitation.”

“I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it STOP Could you tell her so
for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?”

“Yes, I could STOP I will, if you ask it.”

Mr. Carton's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent STOP He stood,
half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar STOP “I do ask it STOP Accept my cordial thanks.”

“What,” said Carton, still only half turned towards him, “do you expect,
Mr. Darnay?”

“The worst.”

“It's the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest STOP But I think their
withdrawing is in your favour.”

Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no
more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other
in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above
them STOP An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded
passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale STOP The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that
refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide
of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along
with them STOP “Jerry STOP Jerry!” Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got
there STOP “Here, sir STOP It's a fight to get back again STOP Here I am, sir!”

Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng STOP “Quick STOP Have you got
it?”

“Yes, sir.”

Hastily written on the paper was the word “ACQUITTED.”

“If you had sent the message, 'Recalled to Life,' again,” muttered
Jerry, as he turned, “I should have known what you meant, this time.”

He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else,
until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out
with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz
swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in
search of other carrion STOP IV STOP Congratulatory


From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor
for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.
Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from
death STOP It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise
in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the
shoemaker of the garret in Paris STOP Yet, no one could have looked at him
twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation
had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and
to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent
reason STOP While one external cause, and that a reference to his long
lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition
from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of
itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those
unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual
Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three
hundred miles away STOP Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from
his mind STOP She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his
misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice,
the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial
influence with him almost always STOP Not absolutely always, for she could
recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few
and slight, and she believed them over STOP Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned
to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked STOP Mr. Stryver, a man of little
more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,
loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing
way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and
conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life STOP He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his
late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean
out of the group: “I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.
Darnay STOP It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the
less likely to succeed on that account.”

“You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,”
 said his late client, taking his hand STOP “I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as
another man's, I believe.”

It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” Mr. Lorry
said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested
object of squeezing himself back again STOP “You think so?” said Mr. Stryver STOP “Well STOP you have been present all day,
and you ought to know STOP You are a man of business, too.”

“And as such,” quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had
now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered
him out of it--“as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up
this conference and order us all to our homes STOP Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.
Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.”

“Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver; “I have a night's work to
do yet STOP Speak for yourself.”

“I speak for myself,” answered Mr. Lorry, “and for Mr. Darnay, and for
Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?”
 He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father STOP His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at
Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,
not even unmixed with fear STOP With this strange expression on him his
thoughts had wandered away STOP “My father,” said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his STOP He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her STOP “Shall we go home, my father?”

With a long breath, he answered “Yes.”

The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the
impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be
released that night STOP The lights were nearly all extinguished in the
passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,
and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of
gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it STOP Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into
the open air STOP A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter
departed in it STOP Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back
to the robing-room STOP Another person, who had not joined the group, or
interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning
against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled
out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away STOP He now
stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement STOP “So, Mr. Lorry STOP Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?”

Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the day's
proceedings; nobody had known of it STOP He was unrobed, and was none the
better for it in appearance STOP “If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the
business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business
appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.”

Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, “You have mentioned that before,
sir STOP We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters STOP We
have to think of the House more than ourselves.”

“_I_ know, _I_ know,” rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly STOP “Don't be
nettled, Mr. Lorry STOP You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better,
I dare say.”

“And indeed, sir,” pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, “I really don't
know what you have to do with the matter STOP If you'll excuse me, as very
much your elder, for saying so, I really don't know that it is your
business.”

“Business STOP Bless you, _I_ have no business,” said Mr. Carton STOP “It is a pity you have not, sir.”

“I think so, too.”

“If you had,” pursued Mr. Lorry, “perhaps you would attend to it.”

“Lord love you, no!--I shouldn't,” said Mr. Carton STOP “Well, sir!” cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,
“business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing STOP And, sir,
if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.
Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance
for that circumstance STOP Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir STOP I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy
life.--Chair there!”

Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.
Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson's STOP Carton,
who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed
then, and turned to Darnay:

“This is a strange chance that throws you and me together STOP This must
be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on
these street stones?”

“I hardly seem yet,” returned Charles Darnay, “to belong to this world
again.”

“I don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far
advanced on your way to another STOP You speak faintly.”

“I begin to think I _am_ faint.”

“Then why the devil don't you dine STOP I dined, myself, while those
numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or
some other STOP Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.”

Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to
Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern STOP Here, they were
shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting
his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat
opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port
before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him STOP “Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr.
Darnay?”

“I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far
mended as to feel that.”

“It must be an immense satisfaction!”

He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large
one STOP “As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it STOP It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it STOP So we
are not much alike in that particular STOP Indeed, I begin to think we are
not much alike in any particular, you and I.”

Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with
this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was
at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all STOP “Now your dinner is done,” Carton presently said, “why don't you call a
health, Mr. Darnay; why don't you give your toast?”

“What health STOP What toast?”

“Why, it's on the tip of your tongue STOP It ought to be, it must be, I'll
swear it's there.”

“Miss Manette, then!”

“Miss Manette, then!”

Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton
flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to
pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another STOP “That's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!”
 he said, filling his new goblet STOP A slight frown and a laconic “Yes,” were the answer STOP “That's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by STOP How does it
feel STOP Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such
sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?”

Again Darnay answered not a word STOP “She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her STOP Not
that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.”

The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this
disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the
strait of the day STOP He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him
for it STOP “I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,” was the careless rejoinder STOP “It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did
it, in the second STOP Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.”

“Willingly, and a small return for your good offices.”

“Do you think I particularly like you?”

“Really, Mr. Carton,” returned the other, oddly disconcerted, “I have
not asked myself the question.”

“But ask yourself the question now.”

“You have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.”

“_I_ don't think I do,” said Carton STOP “I begin to have a very good
opinion of your understanding.”

“Nevertheless,” pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, “there is
nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our
parting without ill-blood on either side.”

Carton rejoining, “Nothing in life!” Darnay rang STOP “Do you call the whole
reckoning?” said Carton STOP On his answering in the affirmative, “Then
bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at
ten.”

The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night STOP Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat
of defiance in his manner, and said, “A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think
I am drunk?”

“I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.”

“Think STOP You know I have been drinking.”

“Since I must say so, I know it.”

“Then you shall likewise know why STOP I am a disappointed drudge, sir STOP I
care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.”

“Much to be regretted STOP You might have used your talents better.”

“May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not STOP Don't let your sober face elate you,
however; you don't know what it may come to STOP Good night!”

When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a
glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it STOP “Do you particularly like the man?” he muttered, at his own image; “why
should you particularly like a man who resembles you STOP There is nothing
in you to like; you know that STOP Ah, confound you STOP What a change you have
made in yourself STOP A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you
what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been STOP Change
places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as
he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was STOP Come on, and
have it out in plain words STOP You hate the fellow.”

He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few
minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the
table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him STOP V. The Jackal


Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard STOP So very great is
the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate
statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow
in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a
perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration STOP The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other
learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr.
Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the
drier parts of the legal race STOP A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had
begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which
he mounted STOP Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite,
specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the
visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench, the
florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of
the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from
among a rank garden-full of flaring companions STOP It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib
man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that
faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is
among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments STOP But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this STOP The more
business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its
pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney
Carton, he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning STOP Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great
ally STOP What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas,
might have floated a king's ship STOP Stryver never had a case in hand,
anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring
at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there
they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was
rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily
to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat STOP At last, it began to get about,
among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton
would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he
rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity STOP “Ten o'clock, sir,” said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to
wake him--“ten o'clock, sir.”

“_What's_ the matter?”

“Ten o'clock, sir.”

“What do you mean STOP Ten o'clock at night?”

“Yes, sir STOP Your honour told me to call you.”

“Oh STOP I remember STOP Very well, very well.”

After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man
dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes,
he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out STOP He turned into the Temple,
and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King's
Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers STOP The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone
home, and the Stryver principal opened the door STOP He had his slippers on,
and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease STOP He
had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which
may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of
Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of
Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age STOP “You are a little late, Memory,” said Stryver STOP “About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.”

They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers,
where there was a blazing fire STOP A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in
the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon
it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons STOP “You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.”

“Two to-night, I think STOP I have been dining with the day's client; or
seeing him dine--it's all one!”

“That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the
identification STOP How did you come by it STOP When did it strike you?”

“I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have
been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.”

Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch STOP “You and your luck, Sydney STOP Get to work, get to work.”

Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining
room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel
or two STOP Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them
out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down
at the table, and said, “Now I am ready!”

“Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,” said Mr. Stryver,
gaily, as he looked among his papers STOP “How much?”

“Only two sets of them.”

“Give me the worst first.”

“There they are, Sydney STOP Fire away!”

The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the
drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table
proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to
his hand STOP Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in
a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in
his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some
lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face,
so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he
stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or
more, before it found the glass for his lips STOP Two or three times, the
matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on
him to get up, and steep his towels anew STOP From these pilgrimages to the
jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious
gravity STOP At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and
proceeded to offer it to him STOP The lion took it with care and caution,
made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal
assisted both STOP When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his
hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate STOP The jackal then
invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application
to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;
this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not
disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning STOP “And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,” said Mr.
Stryver STOP The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming
again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied STOP “You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses
to-day STOP Every question told.”

“I always am sound; am I not?”

“I don't gainsay it STOP What has roughened your temper STOP Put some punch to
it and smooth it again.”

With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied STOP “The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,” said Stryver, nodding
his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, “the
old seesaw Sydney STOP Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and
now in despondency!”

“Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes STOP The same Sydney, with the same
luck STOP Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.”

“And why not?”

“God knows STOP It was my way, I suppose.”

He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before
him, looking at the fire STOP “Carton,” said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,
as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney
Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, “your way
is, and always was, a lame way STOP You summon no energy and purpose STOP Look
at me.”

“Oh, botheration!” returned Sydney, with a lighter and more
good-humoured laugh, “don't _you_ be moral!”

“How have I done what I have done?” said Stryver; “how do I do what I
do?”

“Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose STOP But it's not worth
your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to
do, you do STOP You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.”

“I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?”

“I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,” said
Carton STOP At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed STOP “Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,”
 pursued Carton, “you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into
mine STOP Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,
picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we
didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always
nowhere.”

“And whose fault was that?”

“Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours STOP You were always
driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree
that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose STOP It's a gloomy
thing, however, to talk about one's own past, with the day breaking STOP Turn me in some other direction before I go.”

“Well then STOP Pledge me to the pretty witness,” said Stryver, holding up
his glass STOP “Are you turned in a pleasant direction?”

Apparently not, for he became gloomy again STOP “Pretty witness,” he muttered, looking down into his glass STOP “I have had
enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who's your pretty witness?”

“The picturesque doctor's daughter, Miss Manette.”

“_She_ pretty?”

“Is she not?”

“No.”

“Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!”

“Rot the admiration of the whole Court STOP Who made the Old Bailey a judge
of beauty STOP She was a golden-haired doll!”

“Do you know, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes,
and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: “do you know, I rather
thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,
and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?”

“Quick to see what happened STOP If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a
yard or two of a man's nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass STOP I pledge you, but I deny the beauty STOP And now I'll have no more drink;
I'll get to bed.”

When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light
him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy
windows STOP When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the
dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a
lifeless desert STOP And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and
the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city STOP Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still
on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the
wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and
perseverance STOP In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries
from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the
fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight STOP A moment, and it was gone STOP Climbing to a high chamber in a well of
houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its
pillow was wet with wasted tears STOP Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of
good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,
incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight
on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away STOP VI STOP Hundreds of People


The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not
far from Soho-square STOP On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the
waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried
it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis
Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,
on his way to dine with the Doctor STOP After several relapses into
business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the
quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life STOP On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in
the afternoon, for three reasons of habit STOP Firstly, because, on fine
Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;
secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with
them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and
generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have
his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the
Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
them STOP A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be
found in London STOP There was no way through it, and the front windows of
the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that
had a congenial air of retirement on it STOP There were few buildings then,
north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers
grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields STOP As a
consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,
instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a
settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which
the peaches ripened in their season STOP The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,
though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a
glare of brightness STOP It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful
place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets STOP There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and
there was STOP The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where
several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was
audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night STOP In
a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree
rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver
to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if
he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all
visitors STOP Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured
to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have
a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen STOP Occasionally, a stray
workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered
about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a
thump from the golden giant STOP These, however, were only the exceptions
required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind
the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way
from Sunday morning unto Saturday night STOP Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and
its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him STOP His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting
ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and
he earned as much as he wanted STOP These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and
notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,
on the fine Sunday afternoon STOP “Doctor Manette at home?”

Expected home STOP “Miss Lucie at home?”

Expected home STOP “Miss Pross at home?”

Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the
fact STOP “As I am at home myself,” said Mr. Lorry, “I'll go upstairs.”

Although the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her
birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most
agreeable characteristics STOP Simple as the furniture was, it was set off
by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,
that its effect was delightful STOP The disposition of everything in the
rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,
the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by
delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in
themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry
stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him,
with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this
time, whether he approved STOP There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they
communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them
all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which
he detected all around him, walked from one to another STOP The first was
the best room, and in it were Lucie's birds, and flowers, and books,
and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was
the Doctor's consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,
changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the
Doctor's bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker's
bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris STOP “I wonder,” said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, “that he keeps
that reminder of his sufferings about him!”

“And why wonder at that?” was the abrupt inquiry that made him start STOP It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose
acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and
had since improved STOP “I should have thought--” Mr. Lorry began STOP “Pooh STOP You'd have thought!” said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off STOP “How do you do?” inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to
express that she bore him no malice STOP “I am pretty well, I thank you,” answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; “how
are you?”

“Nothing to boast of,” said Miss Pross STOP “Indeed?”

“Ah STOP indeed!” said Miss Pross STOP “I am very much put out about my
Ladybird.”

“Indeed?”

“For gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed,' or you'll
fidget me to death,” said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from
stature) was shortness STOP “Really, then?” said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment STOP “Really, is bad enough,” returned Miss Pross, “but better STOP Yes, I am
very much put out.”

“May I ask the cause?”

“I don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to
come here looking after her,” said Miss Pross STOP “_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?”

“Hundreds,” said Miss Pross STOP It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her
time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,
she exaggerated it STOP “Dear me!” said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of STOP “I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and
paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take
your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her
for nothing--since she was ten years old STOP And it's really very hard,”
 said Miss Pross STOP Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head;
using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
fit anything STOP “All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,
are always turning up,” said Miss Pross STOP “When you began it--”

“_I_ began it, Miss Pross?”

“Didn't you STOP Who brought her father to life?”

“Oh STOP If _that_ was beginning it--” said Mr. Lorry STOP “It wasn't ending it, I suppose STOP I say, when you began it, it was hard
enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except
that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
circumstances STOP But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven
him), to take Ladybird's affections away from me.”

Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by
this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those
unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and
admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost
it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were
never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon
their own sombre lives STOP He knew enough of the world to know that there
is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so
rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted
respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss
Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably
better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson's STOP “There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,” said
Miss Pross; “and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn't made a
mistake in life.”

Here again: Mr. Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal history had
established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel
who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to
speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with
no touch of compunction STOP Miss Pross's fidelity of belief in Solomon
(deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious
matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her STOP “As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of
business,” he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had
sat down there in friendly relations, “let me ask you--does the Doctor,
in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?”

“Never.”

“And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?”

“Ah!” returned Miss Pross, shaking her head STOP “But I don't say he don't
refer to it within himself.”

“Do you believe that he thinks of it much?”

“I do,” said Miss Pross STOP “Do you imagine--” Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up
short with:

“Never imagine anything STOP Have no imagination at all.”

“I stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,
sometimes?”

“Now and then,” said Miss Pross STOP “Do you suppose,” Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his
bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, “that Doctor Manette has any
theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to
the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his
oppressor?”

“I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.”

“And that is--?”

“That she thinks he has.”

“Now don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a
mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.”

“Dull?” Miss Pross inquired, with placidity STOP Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, “No, no,
no STOP Surely not STOP To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor
Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured
he is, should never touch upon that question STOP I will not say with me,
though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now
intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly
attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him STOP Believe me, Miss
Pross, I don't approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of
zealous interest.”

“Well STOP To the best of my understanding, and bad's the best, you'll tell
me,” said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, “he is afraid
of the whole subject.”

“Afraid?”

“It's plain enough, I should think, why he may be STOP It's a dreadful
remembrance STOP Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it STOP Not
knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never
feel certain of not losing himself again STOP That alone wouldn't make the
subject pleasant, I should think.”

It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for STOP “True,” said
he, “and fearful to reflect upon STOP Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss
Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression
always shut up within him STOP Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness
it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.”

“Can't be helped,” said Miss Pross, shaking her head STOP “Touch that
string, and he instantly changes for the worse STOP Better leave it alone STOP In short, must leave it alone, like or no like STOP Sometimes, he gets up in
the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking
up and down, walking up and down, in his room STOP Ladybird has learnt to
know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in
his old prison STOP She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up
and down, walking up and down, until he is composed STOP But he never says
a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it
best not to hint at it to him STOP In silence they go walking up and down
together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have
brought him to himself.”

Notwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her own imagination, there was a
perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,
in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to
her possessing such a thing STOP The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it
had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it
seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
set it going STOP “Here they are!” said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;
“and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!”

It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a
peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,
looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied
they would never approach STOP Not only would the echoes die away, as though
the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be
heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close
at hand STOP However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross
was ready at the street door to receive them STOP Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking
off her darling's bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up
with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and
folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with
as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
had been the vainest and handsomest of women STOP Her darling was a pleasant
sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against
her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do
playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own
chamber and cried STOP The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at
them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with
eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would
have had more if it were possible STOP Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,
beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor
stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home STOP But, no
Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain
for the fulfilment of Miss Pross's prediction STOP Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people STOP In the arrangements of
the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and
always acquitted herself marvellously STOP Her dinners, of a very modest
quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their
contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be
better STOP Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical
kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of
impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would
impart culinary mysteries to her STOP From these decayed sons and daughters
of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl
who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,
or Cinderella's Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,
a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she
pleased STOP On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days
persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower
regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to
which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance STOP On this occasion,
Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts
to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too STOP It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit
there in the air STOP As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,
they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for
the special benefit of Mr. Lorry STOP She had installed herself, some
time before, as Mr. Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the
plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished STOP Mysterious backs
and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree
whispered to them in its own way above their heads STOP Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves STOP Mr. Darnay
presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he
was only One STOP Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie STOP But, Miss Pross
suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and
retired into the house STOP She was not unfrequently the victim of this
disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, “a fit of the
jerks.”

The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young STOP The
resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as
they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting
his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the
likeness STOP He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual
vivacity STOP “Pray, Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the
plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,
which happened to be the old buildings of London--“have you seen much of
the Tower?”

“Lucie and I have been there; but only casually STOP We have seen enough of
it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.”

“_I_ have been there, as you remember,” said Darnay, with a smile,
though reddening a little angrily, “in another character, and not in a
character that gives facilities for seeing much of it STOP They told me a
curious thing when I was there.”

“What was that?” Lucie asked STOP “In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which
had been, for many years, built up and forgotten STOP Every stone of
its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by
prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers STOP Upon a corner stone
in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to
execution, had cut as his last work, three letters STOP They were done with
some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand STOP At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully
examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or
legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses
were made what the name could have been STOP At length, it was suggested
that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG STOP The
floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the
earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found
the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case
or bag STOP What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he
had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.”

“My father,” exclaimed Lucie, “you are ill!”

He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head STOP His manner and
his look quite terrified them all STOP “No, my dear, not ill STOP There are large drops of rain falling, and they
made me start STOP We had better go in.”

He recovered himself almost instantly STOP Rain was really falling in large
drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it STOP But, he
said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told
of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry
either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned
towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it
when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House STOP He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of
his business eye STOP The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he
was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and
that the rain had startled him STOP Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon
her, and yet no Hundreds of people STOP Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he
made only Two STOP The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and
windows open, they were overpowered by heat STOP When the tea-table was
done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the
heavy twilight STOP Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton
leaned against a window STOP The curtains were long and white, and some of
the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the
ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings STOP “The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,” said Doctor
Manette STOP “It comes slowly.”

“It comes surely,” said Carton STOP They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a
dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do STOP There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes
resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a
footstep was there STOP “A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!” said Darnay, when they had
listened for a while STOP “Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?” asked Lucie STOP “Sometimes, I have
sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of
a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and
solemn--”

“Let us shudder too STOP We may know what it is.”

“It will seem nothing to you STOP Such whims are only impressive as we
originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated STOP I have
sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made
the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming
by-and-bye into our lives.”

“There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,”
 Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way STOP The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more
rapid STOP The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,
as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some
coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in
the distant streets, and not one within sight STOP “Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or
are we to divide them among us?”

“I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you
asked for it STOP When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and
then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
into my life, and my father's.”

“I take them into mine!” said Carton STOP “_I_ ask no questions and make no
stipulations STOP There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,
and I see them--by the Lightning.” He added the last words, after there
had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window STOP “And I hear them!” he added again, after a peal of thunder STOP “Here they
come, fast, fierce, and furious!”

It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,
for no voice could be heard in it STOP A memorable storm of thunder and
lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment's
interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at
midnight STOP The great bell of Saint Paul's was striking one in the cleared air, when
Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set
forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell STOP There were solitary patches
of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful
of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was
usually performed a good two hours earlier STOP “What a night it has been STOP Almost a night, Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry, “to
bring the dead out of their graves.”

“I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don't expect to--what
would do that,” answered Jerry STOP “Good night, Mr. Carton,” said the man of business STOP “Good night, Mr.
Darnay STOP Shall we ever see such a night again, together!”

Perhaps STOP Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar,
bearing down upon them, too STOP VII STOP Monseigneur in Town


Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his
fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris STOP Monseigneur was in
his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to
the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without STOP Monseigneur
was about to take his chocolate STOP Monseigneur could swallow a great many
things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning's chocolate could not so
much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four
strong men besides the Cook STOP Yes STOP It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the
Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his
pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to
conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips STOP One lacquey carried
the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed
the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;
a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold
watches), poured the chocolate out STOP It was impossible for Monseigneur to
dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high
place under the admiring Heavens STOP Deep would have been the blot upon
his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three
men; he must have died of two STOP Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy
and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented STOP Monseigneur was out at
a little supper most nights, with fascinating company STOP So polite and so
impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far
more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and
state secrets, than the needs of all France STOP A happy circumstance
for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly
favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted
days of the merry Stuart who sold it STOP Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which
was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public
business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go
his way--tend to his own power and pocket STOP Of his pleasures, general and
particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world
was made for them STOP The text of his order (altered from the original
by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the fulness
thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.”

Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into
his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of
affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General STOP As to finances
public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and
must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances
private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after
generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor STOP Hence
Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet
time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could
wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,
poor in family STOP Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with
a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer
rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior
mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked
down upon him with the loftiest contempt STOP A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General STOP Thirty horses stood in his
stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women
waited on his wife STOP As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and
forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial
relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality
among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day STOP For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with
every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any
reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not
so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost
equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would
have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have
been anybody's business, at the house of Monseigneur STOP Military officers
destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;
civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the
worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;
all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in
pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of
Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which
anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the
score STOP People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,
yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives
passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were
no less abundant STOP Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies
for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly
patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur STOP Projectors who had
discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the
State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to
root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears
they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur STOP Unbelieving
Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making
card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving
Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this
wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur STOP Exquisite gentlemen of
the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been
since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural
subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of
exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur STOP Such homes had these various
notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies
among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half
of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among
the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and
appearance, owned to being a Mother STOP Indeed, except for the mere act of
bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far
towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing
known to the fashion STOP Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,
and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
supped as at twenty STOP The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
upon Monseigneur STOP In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that
things in general were going rather wrong STOP As a promising way of setting
them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic
sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves
whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the
spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the
Future, for Monseigneur's guidance STOP Besides these Dervishes, were other
three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a
jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of the
Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got
out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of
the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,
by fasting and seeing of spirits STOP Among these, accordingly, much
discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never
became manifest STOP But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of
Monseigneur were perfectly dressed STOP If the Day of Judgment had only been
ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally
correct STOP Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such
delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant
swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would
surely keep anything going, for ever and ever STOP The exquisite gentlemen
of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they
languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;
and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and
his devouring hunger far away STOP Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all
things in their places STOP Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that
was never to leave off STOP From the Palace of the Tuileries, through
Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals
of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball
descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was
required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,
and white silk stockings.” At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a
rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call
him, presided in this dainty dress STOP And who among the company at
Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year
of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled
hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would
see the very stars out STOP Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his
chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown
open, and issued forth STOP Then, what submission, what cringing and
fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation STOP As to bowing down in
body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have
been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never
troubled it STOP Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one
happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably
passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of
Truth STOP There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due
course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate
sprites, and was seen no more STOP The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,
and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs STOP There was soon
but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm
and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his
way out STOP “I devote you,” said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,
and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, “to the Devil!”

With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the
dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs STOP He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and
with a face like a fine mask STOP A face of a transparent paleness; every
feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it STOP The nose,
beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top
of each nostril STOP In those two compressions, or dints, the only little
change that the face ever showed, resided STOP They persisted in changing
colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted
by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of
treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance STOP Examined with
attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the
line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much
too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a
handsome face, and a remarkable one STOP Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and
drove away STOP Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had
stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer
in his manner STOP It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable
to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and
often barely escaping from being run down STOP His man drove as if he were
charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no
check into the face, or to the lips, of the master STOP The complaint had
sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,
that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician
custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a
barbarous manner STOP But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second
time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were
left to get out of their difficulties as they could STOP With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of
consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage
dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming
before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of
its way STOP At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its
wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a
number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged STOP But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have
stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded
behind, and why not STOP But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,
and there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles STOP “What has gone wrong?” said Monsieur, calmly looking out STOP A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of
the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was
down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal STOP “Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!” said a ragged and submissive man, “it is
a child.”

“Why does he make that abominable noise STOP Is it his child?”

“Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.”

The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,
into a space some ten or twelve yards square STOP As the tall man suddenly
got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the
Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt STOP “Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at
their length above his head, and staring at him STOP “Dead!”

The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis STOP There was
nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness
and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger STOP Neither did the
people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they
remained so STOP The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat
and tame in its extreme submission STOP Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes
over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes STOP He took out his purse STOP “It is extraordinary to me,” said he, “that you people cannot take care
of yourselves and your children STOP One or the other of you is for ever in
the way STOP How do I know what injury you have done my horses STOP See STOP Give
him that.”

He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads
craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell STOP The
tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, “Dead!”

He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest
made way STOP On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,
sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were
stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it STOP They
were as silent, however, as the men STOP “I know all, I know all,” said the last comer STOP “Be a brave man, my
Gaspard STOP It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to
live STOP It has died in a moment without pain STOP Could it have lived an hour
as happily?”

“You are a philosopher, you there,” said the Marquis, smiling STOP “How do
they call you?”

“They call me Defarge.”

“Of what trade?”

“Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.”

“Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,” said the Marquis,
throwing him another gold coin, “and spend it as you will STOP The horses
there; are they right?”

Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the
Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the
air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had
paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly
disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor STOP “Hold!” said Monsieur the Marquis STOP “Hold the horses STOP Who threw that?”

He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a
moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the
figure of a dark stout woman, knitting STOP “You dogs!” said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,
except as to the spots on his nose: “I would ride over any of you very
willingly, and exterminate you from the earth STOP If I knew which rascal
threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he
should be crushed under the wheels.”

So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of
what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not
a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised STOP Among the men, not one STOP But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the
Marquis in the face STOP It was not for his dignity to notice it; his
contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he
leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word “Go on!”

He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick
succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the
Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the
whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by STOP The rats
had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking
on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the
spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through
which they peeped STOP The father had long ago taken up his bundle and
bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle
while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running
of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who
had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness
of Fate STOP The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran
into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,
time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together
in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all
things ran their course STOP VIII STOP Monseigneur in the Country


A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant STOP Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas
and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat STOP On
inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent
tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected
disposition to give up, and wither away STOP Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been
lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up
a steep hill STOP A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was
no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was
occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting
sun STOP The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson STOP “It will
die out,” said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, “directly.”

In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment STOP When the
heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down
hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed
quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow
left when the drag was taken off STOP But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village
at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a
church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a
fortress on it used as a prison STOP Round upon all these darkening objects
as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was
coming near home STOP The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor
tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor
fountain, all usual poor appointments STOP It had its poor people too STOP All
its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors,
shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the
fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of
the earth that could be eaten STOP Expressive signs of what made them poor,
were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax
for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be
paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until
the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed STOP Few children were to be seen, and no dogs STOP As to the men and women,
their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest
terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill;
or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag STOP Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions'
whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as
if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in
his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate STOP It was hard by the
fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him STOP He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow
sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the
meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the
truth through the best part of a hundred years STOP Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that
drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before
Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces
drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender
of the roads joined the group STOP “Bring me hither that fellow!” said the Marquis to the courier STOP The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round
to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain STOP “I passed you on the road?”

“Monseigneur, it is true STOP I had the honour of being passed on the road.”

“Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?”

“Monseigneur, it is true.”

“What did you look at, so fixedly?”

“Monseigneur, I looked at the man.”

He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the
carriage STOP All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage STOP “What man, pig STOP And why look there?”

“Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag.”

“Who?” demanded the traveller STOP “Monseigneur, the man.”

“May the Devil carry away these idiots STOP How do you call the man STOP You
know all the men of this part of the country STOP Who was he?”

“Your clemency, Monseigneur STOP He was not of this part of the country STOP Of
all the days of my life, I never saw him.”

“Swinging by the chain STOP To be suffocated?”

“With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur STOP His head hanging over--like this!”

He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his
face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered
himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow STOP “What was he like?”

“Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller STOP All covered with dust,
white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!”

The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all
eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur
the Marquis STOP Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his
conscience STOP “Truly, you did well,” said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such
vermin were not to ruffle him, “to see a thief accompanying my carriage,
and not open that great mouth of yours STOP Bah STOP Put him aside, Monsieur
Gabelle!”

Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary
united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this
examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an
official manner STOP “Bah STOP Go aside!” said Monsieur Gabelle STOP “Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village
to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.”

“Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.”

“Did he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?”

The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen
particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap STOP Some
half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and
presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis STOP “Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?”

“Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as
a person plunges into the river.”

“See to it, Gabelle STOP Go on!”

The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or
they might not have been so fortunate STOP The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill STOP Gradually,
it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many
sweet scents of a summer night STOP The postilions, with a thousand gossamer
gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the
points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the
courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance STOP At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground,
with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor
figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had
studied the figure from the life--his own life, maybe--for it was
dreadfully spare and thin STOP To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling STOP She
turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and
presented herself at the carriage-door STOP “It is you, Monseigneur STOP Monseigneur, a petition.”

With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,
Monseigneur looked out STOP “How, then STOP What is it STOP Always petitions!”

“Monseigneur STOP For the love of the great God STOP My husband, the forester.”

“What of your husband, the forester STOP Always the same with you people STOP He
cannot pay something?”

“He has paid all, Monseigneur STOP He is dead.”

“Well STOP He is quiet STOP Can I restore him to you?”

“Alas, no, Monseigneur STOP But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor
grass.”

“Well?”

“Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?”

“Again, well?”

She looked an old woman, but was young STOP Her manner was one of passionate
grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together
with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly,
caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to
feel the appealing touch STOP “Monseigneur, hear me STOP Monseigneur, hear my petition STOP My husband died of
want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.”

“Again, well STOP Can I feed them?”

“Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it STOP My petition is,
that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband's name, may be placed
over him to show where he lies STOP Otherwise, the place will be quickly
forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I
shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass STOP Monseigneur, they
are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want STOP Monseigneur STOP Monseigneur!”

The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into
a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far
behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly
diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and
his chateau STOP The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as
the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group
at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid
of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his
man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it STOP By degrees, as they
could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled
in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more
stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
been extinguished STOP The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees,
was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged
for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door
of his chateau was opened to him STOP “Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?”

“Monseigneur, not yet.”




IX STOP The Gorgon's Head


It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,
with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of
staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door STOP A stony
business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and
stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in
all directions STOP As if the Gorgon's head had surveyed it, when it was
finished, two centuries ago STOP Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau
preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness
to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile
of stable building away among the trees STOP All else was so quiet, that the
flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great
door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being
in the open night-air STOP Other sound than the owl's voice there was none,
save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of
those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then
heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again STOP The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a
hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase;
grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a
peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord
was angry STOP Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night,
Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up
the staircase to a door in a corridor STOP This thrown open, admitted him
to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two
others STOP High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon
the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries
befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country STOP The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to
break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture;
but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
pages in the history of France STOP A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round
room, in one of the chateau's four extinguisher-topped towers STOP A small
lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds
closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour STOP “My nephew,” said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; “they
said he was not arrived.”

Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur STOP “Ah STOP It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the
table as it is STOP I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.”

In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his
sumptuous and choice supper STOP His chair was opposite to the window, and
he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his
lips, when he put it down STOP “What is that?” he calmly asked, looking with attention at the
horizontal lines of black and stone colour STOP “Monseigneur STOP That?”

“Outside the blinds STOP Open the blinds.”

It was done STOP “Well?”

“Monseigneur, it is nothing STOP The trees and the night are all that are
here.”

The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into
the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round
for instructions STOP “Good,” said the imperturbable master STOP “Close them again.”

That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper STOP He was
half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand,
hearing the sound of wheels STOP It came on briskly, and came up to the
front of the chateau STOP “Ask who is arrived.”

It was the nephew of Monseigneur STOP He had been some few leagues behind
Monseigneur, early in the afternoon STOP He had diminished the distance
rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road STOP He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him STOP He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and
there, and that he was prayed to come to it STOP In a little while he came STOP He had been known in England as Charles Darnay STOP Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake
hands STOP “You left Paris yesterday, sir?” he said to Monseigneur, as he took his
seat at table STOP “Yesterday STOP And you?”

“I come direct.”

“From London?”

“Yes.”

“You have been a long time coming,” said the Marquis, with a smile STOP “On the contrary; I come direct.”

“Pardon me STOP I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time
intending the journey.”

“I have been detained by”--the nephew stopped a moment in his
answer--“various business.”

“Without doubt,” said the polished uncle STOP So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them STOP When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,
looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a
fine mask, opened a conversation STOP “I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that
took me away STOP It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is
a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have
sustained me.”

“Not to death,” said the uncle; “it is not necessary to say, to death.”

“I doubt, sir,” returned the nephew, “whether, if it had carried me to
the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.”

The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight
lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a
graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good
breeding that it was not reassuring STOP “Indeed, sir,” pursued the nephew, “for anything I know, you may have
expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
circumstances that surrounded me.”

“No, no, no,” said the uncle, pleasantly STOP “But, however that may be,” resumed the nephew, glancing at him with
deep distrust, “I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,
and would know no scruple as to means.”

“My friend, I told you so,” said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the
two marks STOP “Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.”

“I recall it.”

“Thank you,” said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed STOP His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical
instrument STOP “In effect, sir,” pursued the nephew, “I believe it to be at once your
bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in
France here.”

“I do not quite understand,” returned the uncle, sipping his coffee STOP “Dare I ask you to explain?”

“I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not
been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would
have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.”

“It is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness STOP “For the honour
of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent STOP Pray excuse me!”

“I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before
yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,” observed the nephew STOP “I would not say happily, my friend,” returned the uncle, with refined
politeness; “I would not be sure of that STOP A good opportunity for
consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence
your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
yourself STOP But it is useless to discuss the question STOP I am, as you say,
at a disadvantage STOP These little instruments of correction, these gentle
aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that
might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest
and importunity STOP They are sought by so many, and they are granted
(comparatively) to so few STOP It used not to be so, but France in all such
things is changed for the worse STOP Our not remote ancestors held the right
of life and death over the surrounding vulgar STOP From this room, many such
dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),
one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing
some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter STOP We have
lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the
assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as
to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience STOP All very bad, very
bad!”

The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;
as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
containing himself, that great means of regeneration STOP “We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern
time also,” said the nephew, gloomily, “that I believe our name to be
more detested than any name in France.”

“Let us hope so,” said the uncle STOP “Detestation of the high is the
involuntary homage of the low.”

“There is not,” pursued the nephew, in his former tone, “a face I can
look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any
deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.”

“A compliment,” said the Marquis, “to the grandeur of the family,
merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur STOP Hah!” And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly
crossed his legs STOP But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes
thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at
him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,
and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of
indifference STOP “Repression is the only lasting philosophy STOP The dark deference of fear
and slavery, my friend,” observed the Marquis, “will keep the dogs
obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,” looking up to it, “shuts
out the sky.”

That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed STOP If a picture of the
chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as
they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to
him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from
the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains STOP As for the roof
he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new
way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead
was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets STOP “Meanwhile,” said the Marquis, “I will preserve the honour and repose
of the family, if you will not STOP But you must be fatigued STOP Shall we
terminate our conference for the night?”

“A moment more.”

“An hour, if you please.”

“Sir,” said the nephew, “we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits
of wrong.”

“_We_ have done wrong?” repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,
and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself STOP “Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account
to both of us, in such different ways STOP Even in my father's time, we did
a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and
our pleasure, whatever it was STOP Why need I speak of my father's time,
when it is equally yours STOP Can I separate my father's twin-brother, joint
inheritor, and next successor, from himself?”

“Death has done that!” said the Marquis STOP “And has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is
frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to
execute the last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last
look of my dear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to
redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.”

“Seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the Marquis, touching him on the
breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--“you
will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.”

Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was
cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking
quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand STOP Once again he
touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of
a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the
body, and said,

“My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have
lived.”

When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his
box in his pocket STOP “Better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a small
bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny STOP But you are lost,
Monsieur Charles, I see.”

“This property and France are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly; “I
renounce them.”

“Are they both yours to renounce STOP France may be, but is the property STOP It
is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”

“I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet STOP If it passed
to me from you, to-morrow--”

“Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.”

“--or twenty years hence--”

“You do me too much honour,” said the Marquis; “still, I prefer that
supposition.”

“--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere STOP It is little to
relinquish STOP What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!”

“Hah!” said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room STOP “To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,
under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,
mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,
and suffering.”

“Hah!” said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner STOP “If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better
qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the
weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave
it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in
another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me STOP There is a curse
on it, and on all this land.”

“And you?” said the uncle STOP “Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new
philosophy, graciously intend to live?”

“I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at
their backs, may have to do some day--work.”

“In England, for example?”

“Yes STOP The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country STOP The
family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.”

The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be
lighted STOP It now shone brightly, through the door of communication STOP The
Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his
valet STOP “England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have
prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew
with a smile STOP “I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may
be indebted to you, sir STOP For the rest, it is my Refuge.”

“They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many STOP You
know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there STOP A Doctor?”

“Yes.”

“With a daughter?”

“Yes.”

“Yes,” said the Marquis STOP “You are fatigued STOP Good night!”

As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy
in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,
which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly STOP At the same
time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin
straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that
looked handsomely diabolic STOP “Yes,” repeated the Marquis STOP “A Doctor with a daughter STOP Yes STOP So
commences the new philosophy STOP You are fatigued STOP Good night!”

It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his STOP The nephew
looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door STOP “Good night!” said the uncle STOP “I look to the pleasure of seeing you
again in the morning STOP Good repose STOP Light Monsieur my nephew to his
chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,” he
added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his
valet to his own bedroom STOP The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his
loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still
night STOP Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no
noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some
enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose
periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just
coming on STOP He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the
scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow
toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the
prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at
the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the
chain under the carriage STOP That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,
the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the
tall man with his arms up, crying, “Dead!”

“I am cool now,” said Monsieur the Marquis, “and may go to bed.”

So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin
gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence
with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep STOP The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables
rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with
very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
the owl by men-poets STOP But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
hardly ever to say what is set down for them STOP For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,
stared blindly at the night STOP Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,
dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads STOP The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might
have come down, for anything that could be seen of it STOP In the village,
taxers and taxed were fast asleep STOP Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as
the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and
the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and
freed STOP The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain
at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the
minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark
hours STOP Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,
and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened STOP Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
trees, and poured its radiance over the hill STOP In the glow, the water
of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces
crimsoned STOP The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the
weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur
the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might STOP At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open
mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken STOP Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village STOP Casement
windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth
shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air STOP Then began the rarely
lightened toil of the day among the village population STOP Some, to the
fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men
and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows
out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside STOP In the church
and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter
prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
foot STOP The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and
surely STOP First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been
reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;
now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked
round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs
pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed STOP All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the
return of morning STOP Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the
chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried
figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and
everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away STOP What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already
at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day's dinner (not
much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to
peck at, on a heap of stones STOP Had the birds, carrying some grains of it
to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds STOP Whether or
no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,
down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the
fountain STOP All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about
in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other
emotions than grim curiosity and surprise STOP The led cows, hastily brought
in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly
on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter STOP Some of
the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and
all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded
on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was
highly fraught with nothing STOP Already, the mender of roads had penetrated
into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting
himself in the breast with his blue cap STOP What did all this portend,
and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind
a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle
(double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of
the German ballad of Leonora STOP It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau STOP The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added
the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited
through about two hundred years STOP It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis STOP It was like a fine
mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified STOP Driven home into the
heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife STOP Round its hilt
was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:

“Drive him fast to his tomb STOP This, from Jacques.”




X STOP Two Promises


More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles
Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French
language who was conversant with French literature STOP In this age, he
would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor STOP He read with
young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a
living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for
its stores of knowledge and fancy STOP He could write of them, besides, in
sound English, and render them into sound English STOP Such masters were not
at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were
to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had
dropped out of Tellson's ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters STOP As a
tutor, whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and
profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became
known and encouraged STOP He was well acquainted, more-over, with the
circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest STOP So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered STOP In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor
to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he
would not have prospered STOP He had expected labour, and he found it, and
did it and made the best of it STOP In this, his prosperity consisted STOP A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he
read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek
and Latin through the Custom-house STOP The rest of his time he passed in
London STOP Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days
when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has
invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay's way--the way of the love of a
woman STOP He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger STOP He had never
heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice;
he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was
confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for
him STOP But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination
at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,
long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the
mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so
much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart STOP That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well STOP It was again a
summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,
he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity
of opening his mind to Doctor Manette STOP It was the close of the summer
day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross STOP He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window STOP The energy
which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated
their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him STOP He was now a
very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength
of resolution, and vigour of action STOP In his recovered energy he was
sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the
exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been
frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare STOP He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease, and was equably cheerful STOP To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at
sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand STOP “Charles Darnay STOP I rejoice to see you STOP We have been counting on your
return these three or four days past STOP Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were
both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.”

“I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,” he answered,
a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor STOP “Miss
Manette--”

“Is well,” said the Doctor, as he stopped short, “and your return will
delight us all STOP She has gone out on some household matters, but will
soon be home.”

“Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home STOP I took the opportunity of her
being from home, to beg to speak to you.”

There was a blank silence STOP “Yes?” said the Doctor, with evident constraint STOP “Bring your chair here,
and speak on.”

He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less
easy STOP “I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,”
 so he at length began, “for some year and a half, that I hope the topic
on which I am about to touch may not--”

He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him STOP When he
had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:

“Is Lucie the topic?”

“She is.”

“It is hard for me to speak of her at any time STOP It is very hard for me
to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.”

“It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor
Manette!” he said deferentially STOP There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:

“I believe it STOP I do you justice; I believe it.”

His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it
originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles
Darnay hesitated STOP “Shall I go on, sir?”

Another blank STOP “Yes, go on.”

“You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly
I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and
the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been
laden STOP Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,
disinterestedly, devotedly STOP If ever there were love in the world, I love
her STOP You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!”

The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the
ground STOP At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,
and cried:

“Not that, sir STOP Let that be STOP I adjure you, do not recall that!”

His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles
Darnay's ears long after he had ceased STOP He motioned with the hand he had
extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause STOP The latter
so received it, and remained silent STOP “I ask your pardon,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some
moments STOP “I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.”

He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or
raise his eyes STOP His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair
overshadowed his face:

“Have you spoken to Lucie?”

“No.”

“Nor written?”

“Never.”

“It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is
to be referred to your consideration for her father STOP Her father thanks
you.”

He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it STOP “I know,” said Darnay, respectfully, “how can I fail to know, Doctor
Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between
you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so
belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it
can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and
child STOP I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled
with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there
is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy
itself STOP I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is
now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
early days in which you were lost to her STOP I know perfectly well that if
you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could
hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that
in which you are always with her STOP I know that when she is clinging to
you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your
neck STOP I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her
own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,
loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration STOP I
have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.”

Her father sat silent, with his face bent down STOP His breathing was a
little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation STOP “Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you
with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as
long as it was in the nature of man to do it STOP I have felt, and do even
now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch
your history with something not quite so good as itself STOP But I love her STOP Heaven is my witness that I love her!”

“I believe it,” answered her father, mournfully STOP “I have thought so
before now STOP I believe it.”

“But, do not believe,” said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice
struck with a reproachful sound, “that if my fortune were so cast as
that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time
put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a
word of what I now say STOP Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I
should know it to be a baseness STOP If I had any such possibility, even at
a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my
heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not
now touch this honoured hand.”

He laid his own upon it as he spoke STOP “No, dear Doctor Manette STOP Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like
you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like
you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting
in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your
life and home, and being faithful to you to the death STOP Not to divide
with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to
come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.”

His touch still lingered on her father's hand STOP Answering the touch for a
moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of
his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
conference STOP A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that
occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread STOP “You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank
you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so STOP Have
you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?”

“None STOP As yet, none.”

“Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once
ascertain that, with my knowledge?”

“Not even so STOP I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I
might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.”

“Do you seek any guidance from me?”

“I ask none, sir STOP But I have thought it possible that you might have it
in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.”

“Do you seek any promise from me?”

“I do seek that.”

“What is it?”

“I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope STOP I well
understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her
innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I
could retain no place in it against her love for her father.”

“If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?”

“I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor's
favour, would outweigh herself and all the world STOP For which reason,
Doctor Manette,” said Darnay, modestly but firmly, “I would not ask that
word, to save my life.”

“I am sure of it STOP Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as
well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and
delicate, and difficult to penetrate STOP My daughter Lucie is, in this one
respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her
heart.”

“May I ask, sir, if you think she is--” As he hesitated, her father
supplied the rest STOP “Is sought by any other suitor?”

“It is what I meant to say.”

Her father considered a little before he answered:

“You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself STOP Mr. Stryver is here too,
occasionally STOP If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.”

“Or both,” said Darnay STOP “I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely STOP You want
a promise from me STOP Tell me what it is.”

“It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own
part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will
bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it STOP I hope you
may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against
me STOP I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask STOP The
condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to
require, I will observe immediately.”

“I give the promise,” said the Doctor, “without any condition STOP I believe
your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it STOP I
believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties
between me and my other and far dearer self STOP If she should ever tell me
that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you STOP If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--”

The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as
the Doctor spoke:

“--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever,
new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility
thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her
sake STOP She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me
than wrong, more to me--Well STOP This is idle talk.”

So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange
his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own
hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it STOP “You said something to me,” said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile STOP “What was it you said to me?”

He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a
condition STOP Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:

“Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my
part STOP My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is
not, as you will remember, my own STOP I wish to tell you what that is, and
why I am in England.”

“Stop!” said the Doctor of Beauvais STOP “I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no
secret from you.”

“Stop!”

For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for
another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips STOP “Tell me when I ask you, not now STOP If your suit should prosper, if Lucie
should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning STOP Do you
promise?”

“Willingly STOP “Give me your hand STOP She will be home directly, and it is better she
should not see us together to-night STOP Go STOP God bless you!”

It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and
darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for
Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his
reading-chair empty STOP “My father!” she called to him STOP “Father dear!”

Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his
bedroom STOP Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at
his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her
blood all chilled, “What shall I do STOP What shall I do!”

Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at
his door, and softly called to him STOP The noise ceased at the sound of
her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down
together for a long time STOP She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night STOP He
slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished
work, were all as usual STOP XI STOP A Companion Picture


“Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his
jackal; “mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.”

Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before,
and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making
a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver's papers before the setting in
of the long vacation STOP The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver
arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until
November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and
bring grist to the mill again STOP Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much
application STOP It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him
through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded
the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled
his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
intervals for the last six hours STOP “Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?” said Stryver the portly, with
his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on
his back STOP “I am.”

“Now, look here STOP I am going to tell you something that will rather
surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
shrewd as you usually do think me STOP I intend to marry.”

“_Do_ you?”

“Yes STOP And not for money STOP What do you say now?”

“I don't feel disposed to say much STOP Who is she?”

“Guess.”

“Do I know her?”

“Guess.”

“I am not going to guess, at five o'clock in the morning, with my brains
frying and sputtering in my head STOP If you want me to guess, you must ask
me to dinner.”

“Well then, I'll tell you,” said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting
posture STOP “Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,
because you are such an insensible dog.”

“And you,” returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, “are such a
sensitive and poetical spirit--”

“Come!” rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, “though I don't prefer
any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still
I am a tenderer sort of fellow than _you_.”

“You are a luckier, if you mean that.”

“I don't mean that STOP I mean I am a man of more--more--”

“Say gallantry, while you are about it,” suggested Carton STOP “Well STOP I'll say gallantry STOP My meaning is that I am a man,” said Stryver,
inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, “who cares more to
be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how
to be agreeable, in a woman's society, than you do.”

“Go on,” said Sydney Carton STOP “No; but before I go on,” said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying
way, “I'll have this out with you STOP You've been at Doctor Manette's house
as much as I have, or more than I have STOP Why, I have been ashamed of your
moroseness there STOP Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and
hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you,
Sydney!”

“It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to
be ashamed of anything,” returned Sydney; “you ought to be much obliged
to me.”

“You shall not get off in that way,” rejoined Stryver, shouldering the
rejoinder at him; “no, Sydney, it's my duty to tell you--and I tell you
to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned
fellow in that sort of society STOP You are a disagreeable fellow.”

Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed STOP “Look at me!” said Stryver, squaring himself; “I have less need to make
myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances STOP Why do I do it?”

“I never saw you do it yet,” muttered Carton STOP “I do it because it's politic; I do it on principle STOP And look at me STOP I
get on.”

“You don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,”
 answered Carton, with a careless air; “I wish you would keep to that STOP As
to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?”

He asked the question with some appearance of scorn STOP “You have no business to be incorrigible,” was his friend's answer,
delivered in no very soothing tone STOP “I have no business to be, at all, that I know of,” said Sydney Carton STOP “Who is the lady?”

“Now, don't let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable,
Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness
for the disclosure he was about to make, “because I know you don't mean
half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance STOP I
make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to
me in slighting terms.”

“I did?”

“Certainly; and in these chambers.”

Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend;
drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend STOP “You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll STOP The young
lady is Miss Manette STOP If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or
delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a
little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not STOP You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I
think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man's opinion of
a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music
of mine, who had no ear for music.”

Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,
looking at his friend STOP “Now you know all about it, Syd,” said Mr. Stryver STOP “I don't care about
fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to
please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself STOP She
will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,
and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her,
but she is worthy of good fortune STOP Are you astonished?”

Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I be
astonished?”

“You approve?”

Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I not approve?”

“Well!” said his friend Stryver, “you take it more easily than I fancied
you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would
be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your
ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will STOP Yes, Sydney, I have had
enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I
feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
inclined to go to it (when he doesn't, he can stay away), and I feel
that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me
credit STOP So I have made up my mind STOP And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to
say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects STOP You are in a bad way, you
know; you really are in a bad way STOP You don't know the value of money,
you live hard, you'll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor;
you really ought to think about a nurse.”

The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as
big as he was, and four times as offensive STOP “Now, let me recommend you,” pursued Stryver, “to look it in the face STOP I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face,
you, in your different way STOP Marry STOP Provide somebody to take care of
you STOP Never mind your having no enjoyment of women's society, nor
understanding of it, nor tact for it STOP Find out somebody STOP Find out some
respectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way,
or lodging-letting way--and marry her, against a rainy day STOP That's the
kind of thing for _you_ STOP Now think of it, Sydney.”

“I'll think of it,” said Sydney STOP XII STOP The Fellow of Delicacy


Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good
fortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her happiness known
to her before he left town for the Long Vacation STOP After some mental
debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as
well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange
at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two
before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it
and Hilary STOP As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly
saw his way to the verdict STOP Argued with the jury on substantial worldly
grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a
plain case, and had not a weak spot in it STOP He called himself for the
plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for
the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to
consider STOP After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer
case could be STOP Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal
proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to
Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present
himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind STOP Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple,
while the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it STOP Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet
on Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way
along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have
seen how safe and strong he was STOP His way taking him past Tellson's, and he both banking at Tellson's and
knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.
Stryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness
of the Soho horizon STOP So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle
in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient
cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.
Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron
bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything
under the clouds were a sum STOP “Halloa!” said Mr. Stryver STOP “How do you do STOP I hope you are well!”

It was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any
place, or space STOP He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks
in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he
squeezed them against the wall STOP The House itself, magnificently reading
the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if
the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat STOP The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would
recommend under the circumstances, “How do you do, Mr. Stryver STOP How do
you do, sir?” and shook hands STOP There was a peculiarity in his manner
of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook
hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air STOP He shook in a
self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.

“Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?” asked Mr. Lorry, in his
business character STOP “Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I
have come for a private word.”

“Oh indeed!” said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed
to the House afar off STOP “I am going,” said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the
desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to
be not half desk enough for him: “I am going to make an offer of myself
in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.”

“Oh dear me!” cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his
visitor dubiously STOP “Oh dear me, sir?” repeated Stryver, drawing back STOP “Oh dear you, sir STOP What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?”

“My meaning,” answered the man of business, “is, of course, friendly and
appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,
my meaning is everything you could desire STOP But--really, you know, Mr.
Stryver--” Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest
manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally,
“you know there really is so much too much of you!”

“Well!” said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,
opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, “if I understand you,
Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!”

Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that
end, and bit the feather of a pen STOP “D--n it all, sir!” said Stryver, staring at him, “am I not eligible?”

“Oh dear yes STOP Yes STOP Oh yes, you're eligible!” said Mr. Lorry STOP “If you say
eligible, you are eligible.”

“Am I not prosperous?” asked Stryver STOP “Oh STOP if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,” said Mr. Lorry STOP “And advancing?”

“If you come to advancing you know,” said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be
able to make another admission, “nobody can doubt that.”

“Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?” demanded Stryver,
perceptibly crestfallen STOP “Well STOP I--Were you going there now?” asked Mr. Lorry STOP “Straight!” said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk STOP “Then I think I wouldn't, if I was you.”

“Why?” said Stryver STOP “Now, I'll put you in a corner,” forensically
shaking a forefinger at him STOP “You are a man of business and bound to
have a reason STOP State your reason STOP Why wouldn't you go?”

“Because,” said Mr. Lorry, “I wouldn't go on such an object without
having some cause to believe that I should succeed.”

“D--n _me_!” cried Stryver, “but this beats everything.”

Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry
Stryver STOP “Here's a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_
a Bank,” said Stryver; “and having summed up three leading reasons for
complete success, he says there's no reason at all STOP Says it with his
head on!” Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off STOP “When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and
when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of
causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady STOP The young
lady, my good sir,” said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, “the
young lady STOP The young lady goes before all.”

“Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver, squaring his
elbows, “that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at
present in question is a mincing Fool?”

“Not exactly so STOP I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,” said Mr. Lorry,
reddening, “that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose
taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could
not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at
this desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my
mind.”

The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's
blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;
Mr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in
no better state now it was his turn STOP “That is what I mean to tell you, sir,” said Mr. Lorry STOP “Pray let there
be no mistake about it.”

Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood
hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the
toothache STOP He broke the awkward silence by saying:

“This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry STOP You deliberately advise me not
to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench
bar?”

“Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?”

“Yes, I do.”

“Very good STOP Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.”

“And all I can say of it is,” laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, “that
this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.”

“Now understand me,” pursued Mr. Lorry STOP “As a man of business, I am
not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of
business, I know nothing of it STOP But, as an old fellow, who has carried
Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and
of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have
spoken STOP The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect STOP Now, you think I
may not be right?”

“Not I!” said Stryver, whistling STOP “I can't undertake to find third
parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself STOP I suppose sense
in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense STOP It's
new to me, but you are right, I dare say.”

“What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And
understand me, sir,” said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, “I
will not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any
gentleman breathing.”

“There STOP I beg your pardon!” said Stryver STOP “Granted STOP Thank you STOP Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be
painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor
Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very
painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you STOP You
know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with
the family STOP If you please, committing you in no way, representing you
in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a
little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon
it STOP If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its
soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied
with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is
best spared STOP What do you say?”

“How long would you keep me in town?”

“Oh STOP It is only a question of a few hours STOP I could go to Soho in the
evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.”

“Then I say yes,” said Stryver: “I won't go up there now, I am not so
hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look
in to-night STOP Good morning.”

Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a
concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it
bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength
of the two ancient clerks STOP Those venerable and feeble persons were
always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly
believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in
the empty office until they bowed another customer in STOP The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have
gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than
moral certainty STOP Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to
swallow, he got it down STOP “And now,” said Mr. Stryver, shaking his
forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, “my way
out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.”

It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found
great relief STOP “You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,” said Mr.
Stryver; “I'll do that for you.”

Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock,
Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of
the morning STOP He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was
altogether in an absent and preoccupied state STOP “Well!” said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of
bootless attempts to bring him round to the question STOP “I have been to
Soho.”

“To Soho?” repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly STOP “Oh, to be sure STOP What am I
thinking of!”

“And I have no doubt,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was right in the
conversation we had STOP My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my
advice.”

“I assure you,” returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, “that I
am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's
account STOP I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let
us say no more about it.”

“I don't understand you,” said Mr. Lorry STOP “I dare say not,” rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and
final way; “no matter, no matter.”

“But it does matter,” Mr. Lorry urged STOP “No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't STOP Having supposed that there was
sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is
not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is
done STOP Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have
repented them in poverty and obscurity often before STOP In an unselfish
aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been
a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am
glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing
for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could
have gained nothing by it STOP There is no harm at all done STOP I have not
proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means
certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to
that extent STOP Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and
giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you
will always be disappointed STOP Now, pray say no more about it STOP I tell you,
I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account STOP And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,
and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do;
you were right, it never would have done.”

Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.
Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of
showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head STOP “Make the best of it, my dear sir,” said Stryver; “say no more about it;
thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!”

Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was STOP Mr. Stryver
was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling STOP XIII STOP The Fellow of No Delicacy


If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the
house of Doctor Manette STOP He had been there often, during a whole year,
and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there STOP When he
cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely
pierced by the light within him STOP And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,
and for the senseless stones that made their pavements STOP Many a night
he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no
transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary
figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams
of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture
in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time
brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,
into his mind STOP Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known
him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon
it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that
neighbourhood STOP On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal
that “he had thought better of that marrying matter”) had carried his
delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the
City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health
for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney's feet still trod
those stones STOP From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became
animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention,
they took him to the Doctor's door STOP He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone STOP She had
never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little
embarrassment as he seated himself near her table STOP But, looking up at
his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed
a change in it STOP “I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!”

“No STOP But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health STOP What
is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?”

“Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to
live no better life?”

“God knows it is a shame!”

“Then why not change it?”

Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that
there were tears in his eyes STOP There were tears in his voice too, as he
answered:

“It is too late for that STOP I shall never be better than I am STOP I shall
sink lower, and be worse.”

He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand STOP The
table trembled in the silence that followed STOP She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed STOP He knew her to
be so, without looking at her, and said:

“Pray forgive me, Miss Manette STOP I break down before the knowledge of
what I want to say to you STOP Will you hear me?”

“If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,
it would make me very glad!”

“God bless you for your sweet compassion!”

He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily STOP “Don't be afraid to hear me STOP Don't shrink from anything I say STOP I am like
one who died young STOP All my life might have been.”

“No, Mr. Carton STOP I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am
sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.”

“Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the
mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget
it!”

She was pale and trembling STOP He came to her relief with a fixed despair
of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have
been holden STOP “If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the
love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken,
poor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been
conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would
bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you,
disgrace you, pull you down with him STOP I know very well that you can have
no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot
be.”

“Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton STOP Can I not recall
you--forgive me again!--to a better course STOP Can I in no way repay your
confidence STOP I know this is a confidence,” she modestly said, after a
little hesitation, and in earnest tears, “I know you would say this to
no one else STOP Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?”

He shook his head STOP “To none STOP No, Miss Manette, to none STOP If you will hear me through a very
little more, all you can ever do for me is done STOP I wish you to know that
you have been the last dream of my soul STOP In my degradation I have not
been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this
home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had
died out of me STOP Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that
I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from
old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever STOP I
have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off
sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight STOP A dream, all
a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down,
but I wish you to know that you inspired it.”

“Will nothing of it remain STOP O Mr. Carton, think again STOP Try again!”

“No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite
undeserving STOP And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the
weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me,
heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in
its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no
service, idly burning away.”

“Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy
than you were before you knew me--”

“Don't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if
anything could STOP You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.”

“Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,
attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can
make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you STOP Have I no power for
good, with you, at all?”

“The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come
here to realise STOP Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life,
the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world;
and that there was something left in me at this time which you could
deplore and pity.”

“Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with
all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!”

“Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette STOP I have proved myself,
and I know better STOP I distress you; I draw fast to an end STOP Will you let
me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life
was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there
alone, and will be shared by no one?”

“If that will be a consolation to you, yes.”

“Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?”

“Mr STOP Carton,” she answered, after an agitated pause, “the secret is
yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.”

“Thank you STOP And again, God bless you.”

He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door STOP “Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this
conversation by so much as a passing word STOP I will never refer to it
again STOP If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth STOP In
the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and
shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made
to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried
in your heart STOP May it otherwise be light and happy!”

He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so
sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept
down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he
stood looking back at her STOP “Be comforted!” he said, “I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette STOP An
hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn
but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any
wretch who creeps along the streets STOP Be comforted STOP But, within myself, I
shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be
what you have heretofore seen me STOP The last supplication but one I make
to you, is, that you will believe this of me.”

“I will, Mr. Carton.”

“My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve
you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and
between whom and you there is an impassable space STOP It is useless to say
it, I know, but it rises out of my soul STOP For you, and for any dear to
you, I would do anything STOP If my career were of that better kind that
there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would
embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you STOP Try to hold
me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one
thing STOP The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new
ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly
and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever
grace and gladden you STOP O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a
happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright
beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is
a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!”

He said, “Farewell!” said a last “God bless you!” and left her STOP XIV STOP The Honest Tradesman


To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in
Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and
variety of objects in movement were every day presented STOP Who could sit
upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and
not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending
westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,
both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where
the sun goes down STOP With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams,
like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever
running dry STOP Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,
since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid
women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from
Tellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore STOP Brief as such
companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed
to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
have the honour of drinking her very good health STOP And it was from
the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent
purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed STOP Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in
the sight of men STOP Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,
but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him STOP It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so
unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.
Cruncher must have been “flopping” in some pointed manner, when an
unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his
attention STOP Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of
funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this
funeral, which engendered uproar STOP “Young Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, “it's a
buryin'.”

“Hooroar, father!” cried Young Jerry STOP The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
significance STOP The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched
his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear STOP “What d'ye mean STOP What are you hooroaring at STOP What do you want to conwey
to your own father, you young Rip STOP This boy is a getting too many for
_me_!” said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him STOP “Him and his hooroars STOP Don't
let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me STOP D'ye
hear?”

“I warn't doing no harm,” Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek STOP “Drop it then,” said Mr. Cruncher; “I won't have none of _your_ no
harms STOP Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.”

His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing
round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach
there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were
considered essential to the dignity of the position STOP The position
appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble
surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and
incessantly groaning and calling out: “Yah STOP Spies STOP Tst STOP Yaha STOP Spies!”
 with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat STOP Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he
always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed
Tellson's STOP Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance
excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:

“What is it, brother STOP What's it about?”

“_I_ don't know,” said the man STOP “Spies STOP Yaha STOP Tst STOP Spies!”

He asked another man STOP “Who is it?”

“_I_ don't know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth
nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the
greatest ardour, “Spies STOP Yaha STOP Tst, tst STOP Spi--ies!”

At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled
against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the
funeral of one Roger Cly STOP “Was he a spy?” asked Mr. Cruncher STOP “Old Bailey spy,” returned his informant STOP “Yaha STOP Tst STOP Yah STOP Old Bailey
Spi--i--ies!”

“Why, to be sure!” exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had
assisted STOP “I've seen him STOP Dead, is he?”

“Dead as mutton,” returned the other, “and can't be too dead STOP Have 'em
out, there STOP Spies STOP Pull 'em out, there STOP Spies!”

The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,
that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the
suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles
so closely that they came to a stop STOP On the crowd's opening the coach
doors, the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands
for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,
that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after
shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and
other symbolical tears STOP These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great
enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a
crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded STOP They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to
its destination amidst general rejoicing STOP Practical suggestions being
much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and
the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it STOP Among the first of these volunteers
was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from
the observation of Tellson's, in the further corner of the mourning
coach STOP The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices
remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief STOP The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the
hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under
close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended
by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach STOP A bear-leader, a
popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional
ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his
bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to
that part of the procession in which he walked STOP Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite
caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting
at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it STOP Its destination
was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields STOP It got there
in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,
accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and
highly to its own satisfaction STOP The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of
providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter
genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual
passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them STOP Chase
was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near
the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and
they were roughly hustled and maltreated STOP The transition to the sport of
window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy
and natural STOP At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had
been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm
the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were
coming STOP Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps
the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual
progress of a mob STOP Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained
behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers STOP The place had a soothing influence on him STOP He procured a pipe from a
neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and
maturely considering the spot STOP “Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,
“you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he
was a young 'un and a straight made 'un.”

Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned
himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his
station at Tellson's STOP Whether his meditations on mortality had touched
his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all
amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent
man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon
his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back STOP Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No
job in his absence STOP The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the
usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea STOP “Now, I tell you where it is!” said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on
entering STOP “If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I
shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you
for it just the same as if I seen you do it.”

The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head STOP “Why, you're at it afore my face!” said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of
angry apprehension STOP “I am saying nothing.”

“Well, then; don't meditate nothing STOP You might as well flop as meditate STOP You may as well go again me one way as another STOP Drop it altogether.”

“Yes, Jerry.”

“Yes, Jerry,” repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea STOP “Ah STOP It _is_
yes, Jerry STOP That's about it STOP You may say yes, Jerry.”

Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,
but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general
ironical dissatisfaction STOP “You and your yes, Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his
bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
oyster out of his saucer STOP “Ah STOP I think so STOP I believe you.”

“You are going out to-night?” asked his decent wife, when he took
another bite STOP “Yes, I am.”

“May I go with you, father?” asked his son, briskly STOP “No, you mayn't STOP I'm a going--as your mother knows--a fishing STOP That's
where I'm going to STOP Going a fishing.”

“Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?”

“Never you mind.”

“Shall you bring any fish home, father?”

“If I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow,” returned that
gentleman, shaking his head; “that's questions enough for you; I ain't a
going out, till you've been long abed.”

He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a
most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in
conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
to his disadvantage STOP With this view, he urged his son to hold her in
conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than
he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections STOP The devoutest
person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an
honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife STOP It was as if a
professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story STOP “And mind you!” said Mr. Cruncher STOP “No games to-morrow STOP If I, as a
honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none
of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread STOP If I, as a honest
tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring
on water STOP When you go to Rome, do as Rome does STOP Rome will be a ugly
customer to you, if you don't STOP _I_'m your Rome, you know.”

Then he began grumbling again:

“With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink STOP I don't
know how scarce you mayn't make the wittles and drink here, by your
flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct STOP Look at your boy: he _is_
your'n, ain't he STOP He's as thin as a lath STOP Do you call yourself a mother,
and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her boy out?”

This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to
perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above
all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal
function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent STOP Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry
was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,
obeyed them STOP Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one
o'clock STOP Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,
took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought
forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other
fishing tackle of that nature STOP Disposing these articles about him
in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,
extinguished the light, and went out STOP Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
bed, was not long after his father STOP Under cover of the darkness he
followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the
court, followed out into the streets STOP He was in no uneasiness concerning
his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the
door stood ajar all night STOP Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
father's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,
walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his
honoured parent in view STOP The honoured parent steering Northward, had not
gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and
the two trudged on together STOP Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the
winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a
lonely road STOP Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,
that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the
second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split
himself into two STOP The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped
under a bank overhanging the road STOP Upon the top of the bank was a low
brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing STOP In the shadow of bank and
wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which
the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side STOP Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that
Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well
defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate STOP He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the
third STOP They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay
there a little--listening perhaps STOP Then, they moved away on their hands
and knees STOP It was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he did,
holding his breath STOP Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking
in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass STOP and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard
that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church
tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant STOP They did not
creep far, before they stopped and stood upright STOP And then they began to
fish STOP They fished with a spade, at first STOP Presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew STOP Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful
striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,
with his hair as stiff as his father's STOP But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not
only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again STOP They
were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for
the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite STOP There was a
screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were
strained, as if by a weight STOP By slow degrees the weight broke away the
earth upon it, and came to the surface STOP Young Jerry very well knew what
it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to
wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he
made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more STOP He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,
it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable
to get to the end of STOP He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt
upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him
and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to
shun STOP It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it
was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the
roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like a dropsical boy's kite without tail and wings STOP It hid in doorways
too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up
to its ears, as if it were laughing STOP It got into shadows on the road,
and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up STOP All this time it was
incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy
got to his own door he had reason for being half dead STOP And even then
it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on
his breast when he fell asleep STOP From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after
daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the
family room STOP Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry
inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the
ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the
bed STOP “I told you I would,” said Mr. Cruncher, “and I did.”

“Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!” his wife implored STOP “You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,” said Jerry, “and me
and my partners suffer STOP You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't
you?”

“I try to be a good wife, Jerry,” the poor woman protested, with tears STOP “Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business STOP Is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his business STOP Is it obeying your
husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?”

“You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.”

“It's enough for you,” retorted Mr. Cruncher, “to be the wife of a
honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
when he took to his trade or when he didn't STOP A honouring and obeying
wife would let his trade alone altogether STOP Call yourself a religious
woman STOP If you're a religious woman, give me a irreligious one STOP You have
no more nat'ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has
of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.”

The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in
the honest tradesman's kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down
at his length on the floor STOP After taking a timid peep at him lying on
his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay
down too, and fell asleep again STOP There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else STOP Mr.
Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid
by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case
he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace STOP He was brushed
and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his
ostensible calling STOP Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side
along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry
from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and
solitude from his grim pursuer STOP His cunning was fresh with the day,
and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not
improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,
that fine morning STOP “Father,” said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep
at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: “what's a
Resurrection-Man?”

Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, “How
should I know?”

“I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy STOP “Hem STOP Well,” returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his
hat to give his spikes free play, “he's a tradesman.”

“What's his goods, father?” asked the brisk Young Jerry STOP “His goods,” said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, “is a
branch of Scientific goods.”

“Persons' bodies, ain't it, father?” asked the lively boy STOP “I believe it is something of that sort,” said Mr. Cruncher STOP “Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite
growed up!”

Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way STOP “It depends upon how you dewelop your talents STOP Be careful to dewelop
your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and
there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit
for.” As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,
to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to
himself: “Jerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will
yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!”




XV STOP Knitting


There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur
Defarge STOP As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping
through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over
measures of wine STOP Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best
of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
he sold at this time STOP A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its
influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy STOP No
vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur
Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in
the dregs of it STOP This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been
early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge STOP It had begun
on Monday, and here was Wednesday come STOP There had been more of early
brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and
slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could
not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls STOP These
were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,
and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy
looks STOP Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop
was not visible STOP He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the
threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see
only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of
wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced
and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come STOP A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps
observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in
at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's
gaol STOP Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built
towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops
of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve
with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible
a long way off STOP Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday STOP It was
high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a
mender of roads in a blue cap STOP All adust and athirst, the two entered
the wine-shop STOP Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast
of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and
flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows STOP Yet, no one had
followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though
the eyes of every man there were turned upon them STOP “Good day, gentlemen!” said Monsieur Defarge STOP It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue STOP It elicited
an answering chorus of “Good day!”

“It is bad weather, gentlemen,” said Defarge, shaking his head STOP Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down
their eyes and sat silent STOP Except one man, who got up and went out STOP “My wife,” said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: “I have
travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called
Jacques STOP I met him--by accident--a day and half's journey out of Paris STOP He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques STOP Give him to
drink, my wife!”

A second man got up and went out STOP Madame Defarge set wine before the
mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company,
and drank STOP In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark
bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near
Madame Defarge's counter STOP A third man got up and went out STOP Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less
than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no
rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast STOP He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even
Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work STOP “Have you finished your repast, friend?” he asked, in due season STOP “Yes, thank you.”

“Come, then STOP You shall see the apartment that I told you you could
occupy STOP It will suit you to a marvel.”

Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a
courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the
staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man
sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes STOP No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had
gone out of the wine-shop singly STOP And between them and the white-haired
man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at
him through the chinks in the wall STOP Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:

“Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three STOP This is the witness
encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four STOP He will tell you all STOP Speak, Jacques Five!”

The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with
it, and said, “Where shall I commence, monsieur?”

“Commence,” was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, “at the
commencement.”

“I saw him then, messieurs,” began the mender of roads, “a year ago this
running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the
chain STOP Behold the manner of it STOP I leaving my work on the road, the sun
going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he
hanging by the chain--like this.”

Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which
he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been
the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village
during a whole year STOP Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before STOP “Never,” answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular STOP Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then STOP “By his tall figure,” said the mender of roads, softly, and with his
finger at his nose STOP “When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,
'Say, what is he like? STOP I make response, 'Tall as a spectre STOP '”

“You should have said, short as a dwarf,” returned Jacques Two STOP “But what did I know STOP The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he
confide in me STOP Observe STOP Under those circumstances even, I do not
offer my testimony STOP Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger,
standing near our little fountain, and says, 'To me STOP Bring that rascal! STOP My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.”

“He is right there, Jacques,” murmured Defarge, to him who had
interrupted STOP “Go on!”

“Good!” said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery STOP “The tall man
is lost, and he is sought--how many months STOP Nine, ten, eleven?”

“No matter, the number,” said Defarge STOP “He is well hidden, but at last
he is unluckily found STOP Go on!”

“I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to
go to bed STOP I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the
village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see
coming over the hill six soldiers STOP In the midst of them is a tall man
with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!”

With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his
elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him STOP “I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers
and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any
spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I
see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and
that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun
going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs STOP Also, I see that
their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the
road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants STOP Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves
with them as they come, tramp, tramp STOP But when they advance quite near
to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me STOP Ah, but he would
be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as
on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!”

He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it
vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life STOP “I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not
show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with
our eyes STOP 'Come on! STOP says the chief of that company, pointing to the
village, 'bring him fast to his tomb! STOP and they bring him faster STOP I
follow STOP His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden
shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame STOP Because he is lame, and
consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!”

He imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the
butt-ends of muskets STOP “As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls STOP They
laugh and pick him up again STOP His face is bleeding and covered with dust,
but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again STOP They bring him into
the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill,
and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the
darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!”

He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding
snap of his teeth STOP Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by
opening it again, Defarge said, “Go on, Jacques.”

“All the village,” pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low
voice, “withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the
village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the
locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,
except to perish STOP In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating
my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on
my way to my work STOP There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty
iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through STOP He has no
hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a
dead man.”

Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another STOP The looks of all
of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the
countryman's story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was
authoritative too STOP They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One
and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on
his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally
intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding
over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge
standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the
light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to
him STOP “Go on, Jacques,” said Defarge STOP “He remains up there in his iron cage some days STOP The village looks
at him by stealth, for it is afraid STOP But it always looks up, from a
distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work
of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all
faces are turned towards the prison STOP Formerly, they were turned towards
the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison STOP They
whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be
executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing
that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say
that a petition has been presented to the King himself STOP What do I know STOP It is possible STOP Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”

“Listen then, Jacques,” Number One of that name sternly interposed STOP “Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen STOP All here,
yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street,
sitting beside the Queen STOP It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the
hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in
his hand.”

“And once again listen, Jacques!” said the kneeling Number Three:
his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a
strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither
food nor drink; “the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner,
and struck him blows STOP You hear?”

“I hear, messieurs.”

“Go on then,” said Defarge STOP “Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,” resumed the
countryman, “that he is brought down into our country to be executed on
the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed STOP They even whisper
that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the
father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a
parricide STOP One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed
with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds
which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be
poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,
that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses STOP That old man
says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on
the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen STOP But how do I know if he lies STOP I am not a scholar.”

“Listen once again then, Jacques!” said the man with the restless hand
and the craving air STOP “The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was
all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and
nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than
the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager
attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,
when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed STOP And it was
done--why, how old are you?”

“Thirty-five,” said the mender of roads, who looked sixty STOP “It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen
it.”

“Enough!” said Defarge, with grim impatience STOP “Long live the Devil STOP Go
on.”

“Well STOP Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;
even the fountain appears to fall to that tune STOP At length, on Sunday
night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from
the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street STOP Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by
the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the
water.”

The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,
and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky STOP “All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,
the cows are there with the rest STOP At midday, the roll of drums STOP Soldiers
have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst
of many soldiers STOP He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is
a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he
laughed.” He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs,
from the corners of his mouth to his ears STOP “On the top of the gallows is
fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air STOP He is hanged
there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water.”

They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face,
on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the
spectacle STOP “It is frightful, messieurs STOP How can the women and the children draw
water STOP Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow STOP Under it, have
I said STOP When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to
bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church,
across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth,
messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!”

The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other
three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him STOP “That's all, messieurs STOP I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),
and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was
warned I should) this comrade STOP With him, I came on, now riding and now
walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night STOP And here
you see me!”

After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, “Good STOP You have acted
and recounted faithfully STOP Will you wait for us a little, outside the
door?”

“Very willingly,” said the mender of roads STOP Whom Defarge escorted to the
top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned STOP The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to
the garret STOP “How say you, Jacques?” demanded Number One STOP “To be registered?”

“To be registered, as doomed to destruction,” returned Defarge STOP “Magnificent!” croaked the man with the craving STOP “The chateau, and all the race?” inquired the first STOP “The chateau and all the race,” returned Defarge STOP “Extermination.”

The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, “Magnificent!” and began
gnawing another finger STOP “Are you sure,” asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, “that no embarrassment
can arise from our manner of keeping the register STOP Without doubt it is
safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always
be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?”

“Jacques,” returned Defarge, drawing himself up, “if madame my wife
undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose
a word of it--not a syllable of it STOP Knitted, in her own stitches and her
own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun STOP Confide in
Madame Defarge STOP It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,
to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or
crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.”

There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who
hungered, asked: “Is this rustic to be sent back soon STOP I hope so STOP He is
very simple; is he not a little dangerous?”

“He knows nothing,” said Defarge; “at least nothing more than would
easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height STOP I charge myself
with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him
on his road STOP He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and
Court; let him see them on Sunday.”

“What?” exclaimed the hungry man, staring STOP “Is it a good sign, that he
wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?”

“Jacques,” said Defarge; “judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her
to thirst for it STOP Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish
him to bring it down one day.”

Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already
dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the
pallet-bed and take some rest STOP He needed no persuasion, and was soon
asleep STOP Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been found
in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree STOP Saving for a mysterious
dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very
new and agreeable STOP But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly
unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that
his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that
he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her STOP For, he
contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it
into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a
murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through
with it until the play was played out STOP Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted
(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
and himself to Versailles STOP It was additionally disconcerting to have
madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was
additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the
afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to
see the carriage of the King and Queen STOP “You work hard, madame,” said a man near her STOP “Yes,” answered Madame Defarge; “I have a good deal to do.”

“What do you make, madame?”

“Many things.”

“For instance--”

“For instance,” returned Madame Defarge, composedly, “shrouds.”

The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender
of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close
and oppressive STOP If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was
fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King
and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the
shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing
ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary
intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,
Long live everybody and everything STOP as if he had never heard of
ubiquitous Jacques in his time STOP Then, there were gardens, courtyards,
terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye,
more lords and ladies, more Long live they all STOP until he absolutely wept
with sentiment STOP During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three
hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,
and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him
from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to
pieces STOP “Bravo!” said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a
patron; “you are a good boy!”

The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of
having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no STOP “You are the fellow we want,” said Defarge, in his ear; “you make
these fools believe that it will last for ever STOP Then, they are the more
insolent, and it is the nearer ended.”

“Hey!” cried the mender of roads, reflectively; “that's true.”

“These fools know nothing STOP While they despise your breath, and would
stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than
in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath
tells them STOP Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot
deceive them too much.”

Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in
confirmation STOP “As to you,” said she, “you would shout and shed tears for anything, if
it made a show and a noise STOP Say STOP Would you not?”

“Truly, madame, I think so STOP For the moment.”

“If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to
pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would
pick out the richest and gayest STOP Say STOP Would you not?”

“Truly yes, madame.”

“Yes STOP And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were
set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,
you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?”

“It is true, madame.”

“You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,” said Madame Defarge, with
a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent;
“now, go home!”




XVI STOP Still Knitting


Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by
the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to
the whispering trees STOP Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now,
for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village
scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead
stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and
terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that
the expression of the faces was altered STOP A rumour just lived in the
village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that
when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to
faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled
up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel
look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever STOP In the
stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder
was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which
everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the
scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the
crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a
skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all
started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares
who could find a living there STOP Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the
stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres
of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the
night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line STOP So does a whole
world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling
star STOP And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse
the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in
the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every
vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it STOP The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,
in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their
journey naturally tended STOP There was the usual stoppage at the barrier
guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual
examination and inquiry STOP Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two
of the soldiery there, and one of the police STOP The latter he was intimate
with, and affectionately embraced STOP When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings,
and they, having finally alighted near the Saint's boundaries, were
picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his
streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:

“Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?”

“Very little to-night, but all he knows STOP There is another spy
commissioned for our quarter STOP There may be many more, for all that he
can say, but he knows of one.”

“Eh well!” said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool
business air STOP “It is necessary to register him STOP How do they call that
man?”

“He is English.”

“So much the better STOP His name?”

“Barsad,” said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation STOP But, he had
been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect
correctness STOP “Barsad,” repeated madame STOP “Good STOP Christian name?”

“John.”

“John Barsad,” repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself STOP “Good STOP His appearance; is it known?”

“Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;
complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face
thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,
sinister.”

“Eh my faith STOP It is a portrait!” said madame, laughing STOP “He shall be
registered to-morrow.”

They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),
and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted
the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the
stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of
her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally
dismissed him to bed STOP Then she turned out the contents of the bowl
of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her
handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the
night STOP All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked
up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which
condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he
walked up and down through life STOP The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a
neighbourhood, was ill-smelling STOP Monsieur Defarge's olfactory sense was
by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than
it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed STOP He
whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe STOP “You are fatigued,” said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the
money STOP “There are only the usual odours.”

“I am a little tired,” her husband acknowledged STOP “You are a little depressed, too,” said madame, whose quick eyes had
never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for
him STOP “Oh, the men, the men!”

“But my dear!” began Defarge STOP “But my dear!” repeated madame, nodding firmly; “but my dear STOP You are
faint of heart to-night, my dear!”

“Well, then,” said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his
breast, “it _is_ a long time.”

“It is a long time,” repeated his wife; “and when is it not a long time STOP Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.”

“It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,” said
Defarge STOP “How long,” demanded madame, composedly, “does it take to make and store
the lightning STOP Tell me.”

Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that
too STOP “It does not take a long time,” said madame, “for an earthquake to
swallow a town STOP Eh well STOP Tell me how long it takes to prepare the
earthquake?”

“A long time, I suppose,” said Defarge STOP “But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything
before it STOP In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not
seen or heard STOP That is your consolation STOP Keep it.”

She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe STOP “I tell thee,” said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,
“that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and
coming STOP I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops STOP I tell thee it
is always advancing STOP Look around and consider the lives of all the world
that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider
the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with
more and more of certainty every hour STOP Can such things last STOP Bah STOP I mock
you.”

“My brave wife,” returned Defarge, standing before her with his head
a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and
attentive pupil before his catechist, “I do not question all this STOP But
it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,
it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.”

“Eh well STOP How then?” demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there
were another enemy strangled STOP “Well!” said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug STOP “We shall not see the triumph.”

“We shall have helped it,” returned madame, with her extended hand in
strong action STOP “Nothing that we do, is done in vain STOP I believe, with all
my soul, that we shall see the triumph STOP But even if not, even if I knew
certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I
would--”

Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed STOP “Hold!” cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with
cowardice; “I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.”

“Yes STOP But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim
and your opportunity, to sustain you STOP Sustain yourself without that STOP When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the
time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.”

Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her
little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains
out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene
manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed STOP Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
wine-shop, knitting away assiduously STOP A rose lay beside her, and if she
now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her
usual preoccupied air STOP There were a few customers, drinking or not
drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about STOP The day was very hot,
and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell
dead at the bottom STOP Their decease made no impression on the other flies
out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they
themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met
the same fate STOP Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they
thought as much at Court that sunny summer day STOP A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she
felt to be a new one STOP She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her
rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure STOP It was curious STOP The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the
customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the
wine-shop STOP “Good day, madame,” said the new-comer STOP “Good day, monsieur.”

She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:
“Hah STOP Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black
hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,
thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister
expression STOP Good day, one and all!”

“Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a
mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.”

Madame complied with a polite air STOP “Marvellous cognac this, madame!”

It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame
Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better STOP She said,
however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting STOP The
visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity
of observing the place in general STOP “You knit with great skill, madame.”

“I am accustomed to it.”

“A pretty pattern too!”

“_You_ think so?” said madame, looking at him with a smile STOP “Decidedly STOP May one ask what it is for?”

“Pastime,” said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her
fingers moved nimbly STOP “Not for use?”

“That depends STOP I may find a use for it one day STOP If I do--Well,” said
madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of
coquetry, “I'll use it!”

It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be
decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge STOP Two
men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,
catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of
looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away STOP Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there
one left STOP They had all dropped off STOP The spy had kept his eyes open,
but had been able to detect no sign STOP They had lounged away in a
poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and
unimpeachable STOP “_John_,” thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted,
and her eyes looked at the stranger STOP “Stay long enough, and I shall knit
'BARSAD' before you go.”

“You have a husband, madame?”

“I have.”

“Children?”

“No children.”

“Business seems bad?”

“Business is very bad; the people are so poor.”

“Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people STOP So oppressed, too--as you say.”

“As _you_ say,” madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an
extra something into his name that boded him no good STOP “Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so STOP Of course.”

“_I_ think?” returned madame, in a high voice STOP “I and my husband have
enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking STOP All we
think, here, is how to live STOP That is the subject _we_ think of, and
it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without
embarrassing our heads concerning others STOP _I_ think for others STOP No, no.”

The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did
not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,
stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame
Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac STOP “A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution STOP Ah STOP the poor
Gaspard!” With a sigh of great compassion STOP “My faith!” returned madame, coolly and lightly, “if people use knives
for such purposes, they have to pay for it STOP He knew beforehand what the
price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.”

“I believe,” said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone
that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary
susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: “I believe there
is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor
fellow STOP Between ourselves.”

“Is there?” asked madame, vacantly STOP “Is there not?”

“--Here is my husband!” said Madame Defarge STOP As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted
him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, “Good day,
Jacques!” Defarge stopped short, and stared at him STOP “Good day, Jacques!” the spy repeated; with not quite so much
confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare STOP “You deceive yourself, monsieur,” returned the keeper of the wine-shop STOP “You mistake me for another STOP That is not my name STOP I am Ernest Defarge.”

“It is all the same,” said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: “good
day!”

“Good day!” answered Defarge, drily STOP “I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when
you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy
and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.”

“No one has told me so,” said Defarge, shaking his head STOP “I know nothing
of it.”

Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his
hand on the back of his wife's chair, looking over that barrier at the
person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would
have shot with the greatest satisfaction STOP The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious
attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh
water, and asked for another glass of cognac STOP Madame Defarge poured it
out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over
it STOP “You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?”
 observed Defarge STOP “Not at all, but I hope to know it better STOP I am so profoundly interested
in its miserable inhabitants.”

“Hah!” muttered Defarge STOP “The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,”
 pursued the spy, “that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting
associations with your name.”

“Indeed!” said Defarge, with much indifference STOP “Yes, indeed STOP When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,
had the charge of him, I know STOP He was delivered to you STOP You see I am
informed of the circumstances?”

“Such is the fact, certainly,” said Defarge STOP He had had it conveyed
to him, in an accidental touch of his wife's elbow as she knitted and
warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity STOP “It was to you,” said the spy, “that his daughter came; and it was
from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown
monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of
Tellson and Company--over to England.”

“Such is the fact,” repeated Defarge STOP “Very interesting remembrances!” said the spy STOP “I have known Doctor
Manette and his daughter, in England.”

“Yes?” said Defarge STOP “You don't hear much about them now?” said the spy STOP “No,” said Defarge STOP “In effect,” madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little
song, “we never hear about them STOP We received the news of their safe
arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,
they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held
no correspondence.”

“Perfectly so, madame,” replied the spy STOP “She is going to be married.”

“Going?” echoed madame STOP “She was pretty enough to have been married long
ago STOP You English are cold, it seems to me.”

“Oh STOP You know I am English.”

“I perceive your tongue is,” returned madame; “and what the tongue is, I
suppose the man is.”

He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best
of it, and turned it off with a laugh STOP After sipping his cognac to the
end, he added:

“Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married STOP But not to an Englishman; to
one who, like herself, is French by birth STOP And speaking of Gaspard (ah,
poor Gaspard STOP It was cruel, cruel STOP ), it is a curious thing that she is
going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard
was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present
Marquis STOP But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is
Mr. Charles Darnay STOP D'Aulnais is the name of his mother's family.”

Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable
effect upon her husband STOP Do what he would, behind the little counter,
as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was
troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy STOP The spy would have been no
spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind STOP Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be
worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad
paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say,
in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the
pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again STOP For some minutes
after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the
husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should
come back STOP “Can it be true,” said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife
as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: “what he has
said of Ma'amselle Manette?”

“As he has said it,” returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, “it
is probably false STOP But it may be true.”

“If it is--” Defarge began, and stopped STOP “If it is?” repeated his wife STOP “--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her
sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.”

“Her husband's destiny,” said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure,
“will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is
to end him STOP That is all I know.”

“But it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange”--said
Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it,
“that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her
husband's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by
the side of that infernal dog's who has just left us?”

“Stranger things than that will happen when it does come,” answered
madame STOP “I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here
for their merits; that is enough.”

She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently
took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head STOP Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable
decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its
disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very
shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect STOP In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned
himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came
to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame
Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place
to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like
her--such as the world will do well never to breed again STOP All the women
knitted STOP They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a
mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the
jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still,
the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched STOP But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts STOP And as Madame
Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer
among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left
behind STOP Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration STOP “A
great woman,” said he, “a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully
grand woman!”

Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and
the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard, as
the women sat knitting, knitting STOP Darkness encompassed them STOP Another
darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing
pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into
thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a
wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty,
Freedom and Life STOP So much was closing in about the women who sat
knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around
a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting,
counting dropping heads STOP XVII STOP One Night


Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat
under the plane-tree together STOP Never did the moon rise with a milder
radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still
seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves STOP Lucie was to be married to-morrow STOP She had reserved this last evening
for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree STOP “You are happy, my dear father?”

“Quite, my child.”

They had said little, though they had been there a long time STOP When it
was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself
in her usual work, nor had she read to him STOP She had employed herself in
both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this
time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so STOP “And I am very happy to-night, dear father STOP I am deeply happy in the
love that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles's love
for me STOP But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or
if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by
the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and
self-reproachful now than I can tell you STOP Even as it is--”

Even as it was, she could not command her voice STOP In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face
upon his breast STOP In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of
the sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and
its going STOP “Dearest dear STOP Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,
quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will
ever interpose between us STOP _I_ know it well, but do you know it STOP In your
own heart, do you feel quite certain?”

Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
scarcely have assumed, “Quite sure, my darling STOP More than that,” he
added, as he tenderly kissed her: “my future is far brighter, Lucie,
seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever
was--without it.”

“If I could hope _that_, my father!--”

“Believe it, love STOP Indeed it is so STOP Consider how natural and how plain
it is, my dear, that it should be so STOP You, devoted and young, cannot
fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be
wasted--”

She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated
the word STOP “--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the
natural order of things--for my sake STOP Your unselfishness cannot entirely
comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself,
how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?”

“If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy
with you.”

He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy
without Charles, having seen him; and replied:

“My child, you did see him, and it is Charles STOP If it had not been
Charles, it would have been another STOP Or, if it had been no other, I
should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have
cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.”

It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him
refer to the period of his suffering STOP It gave her a strange and new
sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long
afterwards STOP “See!” said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon STOP “I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her
light STOP I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think
of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against
my prison-walls STOP I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic,
that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I
could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines
with which I could intersect them.” He added in his inward and pondering
manner, as he looked at the moon, “It was twenty either way, I remember,
and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.”

The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,
deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in
the manner of his reference STOP He only seemed to contrast his present
cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over STOP “I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn
child from whom I had been rent STOP Whether it was alive STOP Whether it had
been born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it STOP Whether it
was a son who would some day avenge his father STOP (There was a time in my
imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable. STOP Whether it
was a son who would never know his father's story; who might even live
to weigh the possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own
will and act STOP Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.”

She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand STOP “I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of
me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me STOP I have
cast up the years of her age, year after year STOP I have seen her married
to a man who knew nothing of my fate STOP I have altogether perished from
the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a
blank.”

“My father STOP Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.”

“You, Lucie STOP It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have
brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and
the moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?”

“She knew nothing of you STOP She cared nothing for you.”

“So STOP But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence
have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as
like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its
foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and
leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress STOP I have seen her
image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held
her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door STOP But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?”

“The figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?”

“No STOP That was another thing STOP It stood before my disturbed sense of
sight, but it never moved STOP The phantom that my mind pursued, was another
and more real child STOP Of her outward appearance I know no more than
that she was like her mother STOP The other had that likeness too--as you
have--but was not the same STOP Can you follow me, Lucie STOP Hardly, I think STOP I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these
perplexed distinctions.”

His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running
cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition STOP “In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight,
coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married
life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father STOP My picture
was in her room, and I was in her prayers STOP Her life was active,
cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.”

“I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love
that was I.”

“And she showed me her children,” said the Doctor of Beauvais, “and
they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me STOP When they passed
a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked
up at its bars, and spoke in whispers STOP She could never deliver me; I
imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things STOP But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and
blessed her.”

“I am that child, I hope, my father STOP O my dear, my dear, will you bless
me as fervently to-morrow?”

“Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night
for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great
happiness STOP My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the
happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.”

He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked
Heaven for having bestowed her on him STOP By-and-bye, they went into the
house STOP There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to
be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross STOP The marriage was to make no
change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,
by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more STOP Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper STOP They were only
three at table, and Miss Pross made the third STOP He regretted that Charles
was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving
little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately STOP So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated STOP But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came
downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,
beforehand STOP All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay
asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his
hands lying quiet on the coverlet STOP She put her needless candle in the
shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;
then, leaned over him, and looked at him STOP Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he
covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the
mastery of them even in his sleep STOP A more remarkable face in its quiet,
resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be
beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night STOP She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that
she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his
sorrows deserved STOP Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once
more, and went away STOP So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves
of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved
in praying for him STOP XVIII STOP Nine Days


The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the
closed door of the Doctor's room, where he was speaking with Charles
Darnay STOP They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr.
Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of
reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss,
but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should
have been the bridegroom STOP “And so,” said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride,
and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet,
pretty dress; “and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought
you across the Channel, such a baby STOP Lord bless me STOP How little I thought
what I was doing STOP How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring
on my friend Mr. Charles!”

“You didn't mean it,” remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, “and
therefore how could you know it STOP Nonsense!”

“Really STOP Well; but don't cry,” said the gentle Mr. Lorry STOP “I am not crying,” said Miss Pross; “_you_ are.”

“I, my Pross?” (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her,
on occasion. STOP “You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it STOP Such
a present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into
anybody's eyes STOP There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection,” said
Miss Pross, “that I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till
I couldn't see it.”

“I am highly gratified,” said Mr. Lorry, “though, upon my honour, I
had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
invisible to any one STOP Dear me STOP This is an occasion that makes a man
speculate on all he has lost STOP Dear, dear, dear STOP To think that there
might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!”

“Not at all!” From Miss Pross STOP “You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?” asked the
gentleman of that name STOP “Pooh!” rejoined Miss Pross; “you were a bachelor in your cradle.”

“Well!” observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, “that
seems probable, too.”

“And you were cut out for a bachelor,” pursued Miss Pross, “before you
were put in your cradle.”

“Then, I think,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was very unhandsomely dealt
with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my
pattern STOP Enough STOP Now, my dear Lucie,” drawing his arm soothingly round
her waist, “I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and
I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final
opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear STOP You leave
your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your
own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next
fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's
shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him STOP And when, at
the fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on
your other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent
him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame STOP Now, I hear
Somebody's step coming to the door STOP Let me kiss my dear girl with an
old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his
own.”

For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the
well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright
golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and
delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam STOP The door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles
Darnay STOP He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they
went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face STOP But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the
shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold
wind STOP He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot
which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day STOP The rest followed in
another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange
eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married STOP Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,
glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the
dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets STOP They returned home to
breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had
mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were
mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the
door at parting STOP It was a hard parting, though it was not for long STOP But her father
cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her
enfolding arms, “Take her, Charles STOP She is yours!”

And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was
gone STOP The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the
preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,
and Miss Pross, were left quite alone STOP It was when they turned into
the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great
change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted
there, had struck him a poisoned blow STOP He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been
expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone STOP But, it was
the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent
manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own
room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the
wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride STOP “I think,” he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, “I
think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him STOP I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back
presently STOP Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine
there, and all will be well.”

It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of
Tellson's STOP He was detained two hours STOP When he came back, he ascended the
old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus
into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking STOP “Good God!” he said, with a start STOP “What's that?”

Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear STOP “O me, O me STOP All is
lost!” cried she, wringing her hands STOP “What is to be told to Ladybird STOP He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!”

Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the
Doctor's room STOP The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been
when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent
down, and he was very busy STOP “Doctor Manette STOP My dear friend, Doctor Manette!”

The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he
were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again STOP He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the
throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old
haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him STOP He worked
hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted STOP Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a
shoe of the old size and shape STOP He took up another that was lying by
him, and asked what it was STOP “A young lady's walking shoe,” he muttered, without looking up STOP “It
ought to have been finished long ago STOP Let it be.”

“But, Doctor Manette STOP Look at me!”

He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in
his work STOP “You know me, my dear friend STOP Think again STOP This is not your proper
occupation STOP Think, dear friend!”

Nothing would induce him to speak more STOP He looked up, for an instant at
a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract
a word from him STOP He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and
words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on
the air STOP The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that
he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked STOP In that, there
seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were
trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind STOP Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above
all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;
the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him STOP In
conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter
precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a
few days of complete rest STOP In aid of the kind deception to be practised
on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been
called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been
addressed to her by the same post STOP These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in
the hope of his coming to himself STOP If that should happen soon, he kept
another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he
thought the best, on the Doctor's case STOP In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course
being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him
attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so STOP He
therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the
first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same
room STOP He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried STOP He abandoned that
attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always
before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had
fallen, or was falling STOP He remained, therefore, in his seat near the
window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place STOP Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,
that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour
after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write STOP When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose
and said to him:

“Will you go out?”

He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,
looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:

“Out?”

“Yes; for a walk with me STOP Why not?”

He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more STOP But, Mr.
Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,
with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in
some misty way asking himself, “Why not?” The sagacity of the man of
business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it STOP Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him
at intervals from the adjoining room STOP He paced up and down for a long
time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he
fell asleep STOP In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his
bench and to work STOP On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them STOP He
returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and
that he thought about it, however confusedly STOP This encouraged Mr. Lorry
to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;
at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then
present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing
amiss STOP This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long
enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's
friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he
appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
him STOP When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:

“Dear Doctor, will you go out?”

As before, he repeated, “Out?”

“Yes; for a walk with me STOP Why not?”

This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer
from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned STOP In the
meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had
sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he
slipped away to his bench STOP The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his
heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day STOP The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth STOP Five days, six days,
seven days, eight days, nine days STOP With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and
heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time STOP The secret was
well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to
observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,
was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on
his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in
the dusk of the ninth evening STOP XIX STOP An Opinion


Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post STOP On the
tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun
into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark
night STOP He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had
done so, whether he was not still asleep STOP For, going to the door of the
Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench
and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading
at the window STOP He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which
Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly
studious and attentive STOP Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt
giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might
not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his
friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed
as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of
which he had so strong an impression had actually happened STOP It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the
answer being obvious STOP If the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there STOP How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor
Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the
Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning STOP Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side STOP If he
had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have
resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none STOP He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular
breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual
had occurred STOP If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.
Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain STOP Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked
out with care STOP Having abundance of time for his usual methodical
toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual
white linen, and with his usual neat leg STOP The Doctor was summoned in the
usual way, and came to breakfast STOP So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those
delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe
advance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken
place yesterday STOP An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to
the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and
counting, and evidently made him uneasy STOP In all other respects, however,
he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid
he sought STOP And that aid was his own STOP Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the
Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:

“My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a
very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is
very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less
so.”

Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the
Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively STOP He had already glanced
at his hands more than once STOP “Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the
arm, “the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine STOP Pray
give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,
for his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette.”

“If I understand,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, “some mental
shock--?”

“Yes!”

“Be explicit,” said the Doctor STOP “Spare no detail.”

Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded STOP “My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,
of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,
the--the--as you express it--the mind STOP The mind STOP It is the case of a
shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how
long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there
are no other means of getting at it STOP It is the case of a shock from
which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace
himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner STOP It is
the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to
be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and
great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his
stock of knowledge, which was already very large STOP But, unfortunately,
there has been,” he paused and took a deep breath--“a slight relapse.”

The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, “Of how long duration?”

“Nine days and nights.”

“How did it show itself STOP I infer,” glancing at his hands again, “in the
resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?”

“That is the fact.”

“Now, did you ever see him,” asked the Doctor, distinctly and
collectedly, though in the same low voice, “engaged in that pursuit
originally?”

“Once.”

“And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all
respects--as he was then?”

“I think in all respects.”

“You spoke of his daughter STOP Does his daughter know of the relapse?”

“No STOP It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her STOP It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.”

The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, “That was very kind STOP That was
very thoughtful!” Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of
the two spoke for a little while STOP “Now, my dear Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most
considerate and most affectionate way, “I am a mere man of business,
and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters STOP I do not
possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of
intelligence; I want guiding STOP There is no man in this world on whom
I could so rely for right guidance, as on you STOP Tell me, how does this
relapse come about STOP Is there danger of another STOP Could a repetition of it
be prevented STOP How should a repetition of it be treated STOP How does it come
about at all STOP What can I do for my friend STOP No man ever can have been
more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,
if I knew how STOP “But I don't know how to originate, in such a case STOP If your sagacity,
knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be
able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little STOP Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,
and teach me how to be a little more useful.”

Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and
Mr. Lorry did not press him STOP “I think it probable,” said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,
“that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite
unforeseen by its subject.”

“Was it dreaded by him?” Mr. Lorry ventured to ask STOP “Very much.” He said it with an involuntary shudder STOP “You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's
mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force
himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.”

“Would he,” asked Mr. Lorry, “be sensibly relieved if he could prevail
upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on
him?”

“I think so STOP But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible STOP I even
believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.”

“Now,” said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor's arm again,
after a short silence on both sides, “to what would you refer this
attack?”

“I believe,” returned Doctor Manette, “that there had been a strong and
extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
was the first cause of the malady STOP Some intense associations of a most
distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think STOP It is probable that
there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations
would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a
particular occasion STOP He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the
effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.”

“Would he remember what took place in the relapse?” asked Mr. Lorry,
with natural hesitation STOP The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and
answered, in a low voice, “Not at all.”

“Now, as to the future,” hinted Mr. Lorry STOP “As to the future,” said the Doctor, recovering firmness, “I should have
great hope STOP As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I
should have great hope STOP He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated
something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,
and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that
the worst was over.”

“Well, well STOP That's good comfort STOP I am thankful!” said Mr. Lorry STOP “I am thankful!” repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence STOP “There are two other points,” said Mr. Lorry, “on which I am anxious to
be instructed STOP I may go on?”

“You cannot do your friend a better service.” The Doctor gave him his
hand STOP “To the first, then STOP He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;
he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things STOP Now, does
he do too much?”

“I think not STOP It may be the character of his mind, to be always in
singular need of occupation STOP That may be, in part, natural to it; in
part, the result of affliction STOP The less it was occupied with healthy
things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy
direction STOP He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.”

“You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?”

“I think I am quite sure of it.”

“My dear Manette, if he were overworked now--”

“My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be STOP There has been a
violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.”

“Excuse me, as a persistent man of business STOP Assuming for a moment,
that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this
disorder?”

“I do not think so STOP I do not think,” said Doctor Manette with the
firmness of self-conviction, “that anything but the one train of
association would renew it STOP I think that, henceforth, nothing but some
extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it STOP After what has
happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any
such violent sounding of that string again STOP I trust, and I almost
believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.”

He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the
confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
endurance and distress STOP It was not for his friend to abate that
confidence STOP He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he
really was, and approached his second and last point STOP He felt it to
be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning
conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the
last nine days, he knew that he must face it STOP “The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
so happily recovered from,” said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, “we
will call--Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work STOP We will say, to put a
case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad
time, to work at a little forge STOP We will say that he was unexpectedly
found at his forge again STOP Is it not a pity that he should keep it by
him?”

The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot
nervously on the ground STOP “He has always kept it by him,” said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at
his friend STOP “Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?”

Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the
ground STOP “You do not find it easy to advise me?” said Mr. Lorry STOP “I quite
understand it to be a nice question STOP And yet I think--” And there he
shook his head, and stopped STOP “You see,” said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause,
“it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings
of this poor man's mind STOP He once yearned so frightfully for that
occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved
his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for
the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more
practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental
torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it
quite out of his reach STOP Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of
himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind
of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not
find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may
fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.”

He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry's
face STOP “But may not--mind STOP I ask for information, as a plodding man of business
who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and
bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of
the idea STOP If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go
with it STOP In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the
forge?”

There was another silence STOP “You see, too,” said the Doctor, tremulously, “it is such an old
companion.”

“I would not keep it,” said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained
in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted STOP “I would recommend him to
sacrifice it STOP I only want your authority STOP I am sure it does no good STOP Come STOP Give me your authority, like a dear good man STOP For his daughter's
sake, my dear Manette!”

Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him STOP “In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it STOP But, I would not take
it away while he was present STOP Let it be removed when he is not there;
let him miss his old companion after an absence.”

Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended STOP They
passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored STOP On the
three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth
day he went away to join Lucie and her husband STOP The precaution that
had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously
explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and
she had no suspicions STOP On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into
his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross
carrying a light STOP There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and
guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker's bench to pieces, while
Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for
which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure STOP The
burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools,
shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden STOP So wicked do destruction
and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross,
while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible
crime STOP XX STOP A Plea


When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to
offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton STOP They had not been at home
many hours, when he presented himself STOP He was not improved in habits, or
in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity
about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay STOP He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of
speaking to him when no one overheard STOP “Mr STOP Darnay,” said Carton, “I wish we might be friends.”

“We are already friends, I hope.”

“You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don't
mean any fashion of speech STOP Indeed, when I say I wish we might be
friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.”

Charles Darnay--as was natural--asked him, in all good-humour and
good-fellowship, what he did mean STOP “Upon my life,” said Carton, smiling, “I find that easier to comprehend
in my own mind, than to convey to yours STOP However, let me try STOP You
remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than
usual?”

“I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that
you had been drinking.”

“I remember it too STOP The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I
always remember them STOP I hope it may be taken into account one day,
when all days are at an end for me STOP Don't be alarmed; I am not going to
preach.”

“I am not at all alarmed STOP Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming
to me.”

“Ah!” said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that
away STOP “On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as
you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you STOP I
wish you would forget it.”

“I forgot it long ago.”

“Fashion of speech again STOP But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to
me, as you represent it to be to you STOP I have by no means forgotten it,
and a light answer does not help me to forget it.”

“If it was a light answer,” returned Darnay, “I beg your forgiveness
for it STOP I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my
surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside STOP I declare to you, on the
faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind STOP Good
Heaven, what was there to dismiss STOP Have I had nothing more important to
remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?”

“As to the great service,” said Carton, “I am bound to avow to you, when
you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I
don't know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind STOP I
say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.”

“You make light of the obligation,” returned Darnay, “but I will not
quarrel with _your_ light answer.”

“Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me STOP I have gone aside from my purpose;
I was speaking about our being friends STOP Now, you know me; you know I am
incapable of all the higher and better flights of men STOP If you doubt it,
ask Stryver, and he'll tell you so.”

“I prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his.”

“Well STOP At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never done
any good, and never will.”

“I don't know that you 'never will STOP '”

“But I do, and you must take my word for it STOP Well STOP If you could endure
to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent
reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be
permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might
be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the
resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of
furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of STOP I
doubt if I should abuse the permission STOP It is a hundred to one if I
should avail myself of it four times in a year STOP It would satisfy me, I
dare say, to know that I had it.”

“Will you try?”

“That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have
indicated STOP I thank you, Darnay STOP I may use that freedom with your name?”

“I think so, Carton, by this time.”

They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away STOP Within a minute
afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever STOP When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss
Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of
this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a
problem of carelessness and recklessness STOP He spoke of him, in short, not
bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw
him as he showed himself STOP He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found
her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
marked STOP “We are thoughtful to-night!” said Darnay, drawing his arm about her STOP “Yes, dearest Charles,” with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring
and attentive expression fixed upon him; “we are rather thoughtful
to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.”

“What is it, my Lucie?”

“Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to
ask it?”

“Will I promise STOP What will I not promise to my Love?”

What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the
cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him STOP “I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and
respect than you expressed for him to-night.”

“Indeed, my own STOP Why so?”

“That is what you are not to ask me STOP But I think--I know--he does.”

“If you know it, it is enough STOP What would you have me do, my Life?”

“I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very
lenient on his faults when he is not by STOP I would ask you to believe that
he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep
wounds in it STOP My dear, I have seen it bleeding.”

“It is a painful reflection to me,” said Charles Darnay, quite
astounded, “that I should have done him any wrong STOP I never thought this
of him.”

“My husband, it is so STOP I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is
scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
now STOP But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things,
even magnanimous things.”

She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man,
that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours STOP “And, O my dearest Love!” she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her
head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, “remember how strong
we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!”

The supplication touched him home STOP “I will always remember it, dear
Heart STOP I will remember it as long as I live.”

He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded
her in his arms STOP If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets,
could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops
of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of
that husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not
have parted from his lips for the first time--

“God bless her for her sweet compassion!”




XXI STOP Echoing Footsteps


A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where
the Doctor lived STOP Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound
her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and
companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in
the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of
years STOP At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife,
when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be
dimmed STOP For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,
afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much STOP Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her:
doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided
her breast STOP Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of
footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would
be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her
eyes, and broke like waves STOP That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom STOP Then, among the
advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of
her prattling words STOP Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young
mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming STOP They came, and
the shady house was sunny with a child's laugh, and the Divine friend of
children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take
her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred
joy to her STOP Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,
weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all
their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the
echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds STOP Her husband's
step was strong and prosperous among them; her father's firm and equal STOP Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an
unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the
plane-tree in the garden STOP Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not
harsh nor cruel STOP Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a
pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant
smile, “Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to
leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!” those were not
tears all of agony that wetted his young mother's cheek, as the spirit
departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it STOP Suffer them and
forbid them not STOP They see my Father's face STOP O Father, blessed words STOP Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other
echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath
of Heaven STOP Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were
mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed
murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as
the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or
dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of
the Two Cities that were blended in her life STOP The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton STOP Some
half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in
uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once
done often STOP He never came there heated with wine STOP And one other thing
regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by
all true echoes for ages and ages STOP No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a
blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother,
but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive
delicacy of pity for him STOP What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in
such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here STOP Carton
was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms,
and he kept his place with her as she grew STOP The little boy had spoken of
him, almost at the last STOP “Poor Carton STOP Kiss him for me!”

Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine
forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in
his wake, like a boat towed astern STOP As the boat so favoured is usually
in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped
life of it STOP But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and
stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made
it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his
state of lion's jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
rising to be a lion STOP Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with
property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them
but the straight hair of their dumpling heads STOP These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most
offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three
sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to
Lucie's husband: delicately saying “Halloa STOP here are three lumps of
bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!” The polite
rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr.
Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the
training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the
pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow STOP He was also in the habit of
declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts
Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to “catch” him, and on the
diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him “not
to be caught.” Some of his King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally
parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the
latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed
it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an
originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender's being carried
off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way STOP These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes
amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little
daughter was six years old STOP How near to her heart the echoes of her
child's tread came, and those of her own dear father's, always active
and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband's, need not be told STOP Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself
with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any
waste, was music to her STOP Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet
in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her
more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the
many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed
to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her “What is
the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us,
as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to
have too much to do?”

But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly
in the corner all through this space of time STOP And it was now, about
little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound,
as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising STOP On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.
Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and
her husband in the dark window STOP It was a hot, wild night, and they were
all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the
lightning from the same place STOP “I began to think,” said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, “that
I should have to pass the night at Tellson's STOP We have been so full of
business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way
to turn STOP There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a
run of confidence upon us STOP Our customers over there, seem not to be able
to confide their property to us fast enough STOP There is positively a mania
among some of them for sending it to England.”

“That has a bad look,” said Darnay--

“A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay STOP Yes, but we don't know what reason
there is in it STOP People are so unreasonable STOP Some of us at Tellson's are
getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course
without due occasion.”

“Still,” said Darnay, “you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.”

“I know that, to be sure,” assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade
himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, “but I
am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration STOP Where is
Manette?”

“Here he is,” said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment STOP “I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by
which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without
reason STOP You are not going out, I hope?”

“No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,” said the
Doctor STOP “I don't think I do like, if I may speak my mind STOP I am not fit to be
pitted against you to-night STOP Is the teaboard still there, Lucie STOP I can't
see.”

“Of course, it has been kept for you.”

“Thank ye, my dear STOP The precious child is safe in bed?”

“And sleeping soundly.”

“That's right; all safe and well STOP I don't know why anything should be
otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out
all day, and I am not as young as I was STOP My tea, my dear STOP Thank ye STOP Now,
come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear
the echoes about which you have your theory.”

“Not a theory; it was a fancy.”

“A fancy, then, my wise pet,” said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand STOP “They
are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not STOP Only hear them!”

Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody's
life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the
footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in
the dark London window STOP Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows
heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy
heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun STOP A tremendous
roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms
struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind:
all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a
weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off STOP Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what
agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the
heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could
have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges,
powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every
weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise STOP People who
could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to
force stones and bricks out of their places in walls STOP Every pulse and
heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat STOP Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented
with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it STOP As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging
circled round Defarge's wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron
had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,
already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,
thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm
another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar STOP “Keep near to me, Jacques Three,” cried Defarge; “and do you, Jacques
One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these
patriots as you can STOP Where is my wife?”

“Eh, well STOP Here you see me!” said madame, composed as ever, but not
knitting to-day STOP Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe,
in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol
and a cruel knife STOP “Where do you go, my wife?”

“I go,” said madame, “with you at present STOP You shall see me at the head
of women, by-and-bye.”

“Come, then!” cried Defarge, in a resounding voice STOP “Patriots and
friends, we are ready STOP The Bastille!”

With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped
into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on
depth, and overflowed the city to that point STOP Alarm-bells ringing, drums
beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack
began STOP Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great
towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke STOP Through the fire and through
the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against
a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of the
wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours STOP Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers,
cannon, muskets, fire and smoke STOP One drawbridge down STOP “Work, comrades
all, work STOP Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques
Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all
the Angels or the Devils--which you prefer--work!” Thus Defarge of the
wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot STOP “To me, women!” cried madame his wife STOP “What STOP We can kill as well as
the men when the place is taken!” And to her, with a shrill thirsty
cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and
revenge STOP Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single
drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers STOP Slight
displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded STOP Flashing
weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work
at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys,
execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the
furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the
single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great
towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot
by the service of Four fierce hours STOP A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly
perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly
the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the
wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer
walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered STOP So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to
draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been
struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the
outer courtyard of the Bastille STOP There, against an angle of a wall, he
made a struggle to look about him STOP Jacques Three was nearly at his side;
Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the
inner distance, and her knife was in her hand STOP Everywhere was tumult,
exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet
furious dumb-show STOP “The Prisoners!”

“The Records!”

“The secret cells!”

“The instruments of torture!”

“The Prisoners!”

Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, “The Prisoners!” was
the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an
eternity of people, as well as of time and space STOP When the foremost
billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and
threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained
undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of
these men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his
hand--separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the
wall STOP “Show me the North Tower!” said Defarge STOP “Quick!”

“I will faithfully,” replied the man, “if you will come with me STOP But
there is no one there.”

“What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?” asked
Defarge STOP “Quick!”

“The meaning, monsieur?”

“Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity STOP Or do you mean that I
shall strike you dead?”

“Kill him!” croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up STOP “Monsieur, it is a cell.”

“Show it me!”

“Pass this way, then.”

Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed
by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed,
held by Defarge's arm as he held by the turnkey's STOP Their three heads had
been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much
as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the
noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and
its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases STOP All around
outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which,
occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the
air like spray STOP Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past
hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,
and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry
waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three,
linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make STOP Here and
there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by;
but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a
tower, they were alone STOP Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls
and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible
to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had
come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing STOP The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung
the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed
in:

“One hundred and five, North Tower!”

There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall,
with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by
stooping low and looking up STOP There was a small chimney, heavily barred
across, a few feet within STOP There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes
on the hearth STOP There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed STOP There were
the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them STOP “Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,” said
Defarge to the turnkey STOP The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes STOP “Stop!--Look here, Jacques!”

“A STOP M.!” croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily STOP “Alexandre Manette,” said Defarge in his ear, following the letters
with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder STOP “And here he
wrote 'a poor physician. STOP And it was he, without doubt, who scratched
a calendar on this stone STOP What is that in your hand STOP A crowbar STOP Give it
me!”

He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand STOP He made a sudden
exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and
table, beat them to pieces in a few blows STOP “Hold the light higher!” he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey STOP “Look
among those fragments with care, Jacques STOP And see STOP Here is my knife,”
 throwing it to him; “rip open that bed, and search the straw STOP Hold the
light higher, you!”

With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and,
peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar,
and worked at the iron grating across it STOP In a few minutes, some mortar
and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and
in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney
into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a
cautious touch STOP “Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?”

“Nothing.”

“Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell STOP So STOP Light
them, you!”

The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot STOP Stooping
again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and
retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense
of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once
more STOP They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself STOP Saint
Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard
upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people STOP Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for
judgment STOP Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people's
blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be
unavenged STOP In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to
encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red
decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a
woman's STOP “See, there is my husband!” she cried, pointing him out STOP “See Defarge!” She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and
remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through
the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable
close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to
be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the
long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him
when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot
upon his neck, and with her cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his head STOP The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea
of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do STOP Saint
Antoine's blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the
iron hand was down--down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the
governor's body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge
where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation STOP “Lower
the lamp yonder!” cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new
means of death; “here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!” The
swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on STOP The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving
of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces
were yet unknown STOP The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes,
voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering
until the touch of pity could make no mark on them STOP But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was
in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so
fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore
more memorable wrecks with it STOP Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly
released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high
overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last
Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits STOP Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose
drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day STOP Impassive
faces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them;
faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped
lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, “THOU DIDST
IT!”

Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the
accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters
and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken
hearts,--such, and such--like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint
Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven
hundred and eighty-nine STOP Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay,
and keep these feet far out of her life STOP For, they are headlong, mad,
and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask
at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once
stained red STOP XXII STOP The Sea Still Rises


Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften
his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with
the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame
Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers STOP Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of
Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting
themselves to the saint's mercies STOP The lamps across his streets had a
portentously elastic swing with them STOP Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,
contemplating the wine-shop and the street STOP In both, there were several
knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense
of power enthroned on their distress STOP The raggedest nightcap, awry on
the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: “I know how
hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself;
but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to
destroy life in you?” Every lean bare arm, that had been without work
before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike STOP The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that
they could tear STOP There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine;
the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the
last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression STOP Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was
to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women STOP One of her
sisterhood knitted beside her STOP The short, rather plump wife of a starved
grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had
already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance STOP “Hark!” said The Vengeance STOP “Listen, then STOP Who comes?”

As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine
Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading
murmur came rushing along STOP “It is Defarge,” said madame STOP “Silence, patriots!”

Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked
around him STOP “Listen, everywhere!” said madame again STOP “Listen to him!”
 Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open
mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had
sprung to their feet STOP “Say then, my husband STOP What is it?”

“News from the other world!”

“How, then?” cried madame, contemptuously STOP “The other world?”

“Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people
that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?”

“Everybody!” from all throats STOP “The news is of him STOP He is among us!”

“Among us!” from the universal throat again STOP “And dead?”

“Not dead STOP He feared us so much--and with reason--that he caused himself
to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral STOP But they have
found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in STOP I have
seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner STOP I have
said that he had reason to fear us STOP Say all STOP _Had_ he reason?”

Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had
never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he
could have heard the answering cry STOP A moment of profound silence followed STOP Defarge and his wife looked
steadfastly at one another STOP The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum
was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter STOP “Patriots!” said Defarge, in a determined voice, “are we ready?”

Instantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating
in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and
The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about
her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to
house, rousing the women STOP The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked
from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into
the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest STOP From
such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their
children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground
famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one
another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions STOP Villain Foulon taken, my sister STOP Old Foulon taken, my mother STOP Miscreant
Foulon taken, my daughter STOP Then, a score of others ran into the midst of
these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon
alive STOP Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass STOP Foulon
who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread
to give him STOP Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these
breasts were dry with want STOP O mother of God, this Foulon STOP O Heaven our
suffering STOP Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my
knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon STOP Husbands, and brothers,
and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon,
Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend
Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from
him STOP With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy,
whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they
dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men
belonging to them from being trampled under foot STOP Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment STOP This Foulon was at
the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed STOP Never, if Saint Antoine knew
his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs STOP Armed men and women flocked out
of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with
such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not
a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the
wailing children STOP No STOP They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where
this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent
open space and streets STOP The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance,
and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance
from him in the Hall STOP “See!” cried madame, pointing with her knife STOP “See the old villain bound
with ropes STOP That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back STOP Ha, ha STOP That was well done STOP Let him eat it now!” Madame put her knife
under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play STOP The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of
her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to
others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the
clapping of hands STOP Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl,
and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge's frequent
expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at
a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some
wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture
to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a
telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building STOP At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or
protection, directly down upon the old prisoner's head STOP The favour was
too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had
stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got
him STOP It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd STOP Defarge
had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable
wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned
her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and
Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows
had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high
perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, “Bring him
out STOP Bring him to the lamp!”

Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on
his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at,
and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his
face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always
entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of
action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one
another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through
a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one
of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a cat
might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him
while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately
screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have
him killed with grass in his mouth STOP Once, he went aloft, and the rope
broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope
broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and
held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the
mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of STOP Nor was this the end of the day's bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted
and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when
the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the
people's enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard
five hundred strong, in cavalry alone STOP Saint Antoine wrote his crimes
on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the
breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on
pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession
through the streets STOP Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children,
wailing and breadless STOP Then, the miserable bakers' shops were beset by
long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while
they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by
embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them
again in gossip STOP Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and
frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and
slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in
common, afterwards supping at their doors STOP Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of
most other sauce to wretched bread STOP Yet, human fellowship infused
some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of
cheerfulness out of them STOP Fathers and mothers who had had their full
share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;
and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and
hoped STOP It was almost morning, when Defarge's wine-shop parted with its last
knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in
husky tones, while fastening the door:

“At last it is come, my dear!”

“Eh well!” returned madame STOP “Almost.”

Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with
her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest STOP The drum's was the
only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed STOP The
Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had
the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon
was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint
Antoine's bosom STOP XXIII STOP Fire Rises


There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where
the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the
highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his
poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together STOP The prison on the
crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,
but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of
them knew what his men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not
be what he was ordered STOP Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation STOP Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as
shrivelled and poor as the miserable people STOP Everything was bowed down,
dejected, oppressed, and broken STOP Habitations, fences, domesticated
animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn
out STOP Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national
blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of
luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose;
nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought
things to this STOP Strange that Creation, designed expressly for
Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out STOP There must
be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely STOP Thus it
was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the
flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that
its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing
to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and
unaccountable STOP But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like
it STOP For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung
it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures
of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting
the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces
of barbarous and barren wilderness STOP No STOP The change consisted in
the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the
disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and
beautifying features of Monseigneur STOP For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the
dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and
to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in
thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if
he had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour,
and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on
foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now
a frequent presence STOP As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern
without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian
aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a
mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many
highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled
with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods STOP Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather,
as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he
could get from a shower of hail STOP The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill,
and at the prison on the crag STOP When he had identified these objects
in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just
intelligible:

“How goes it, Jacques?”

“All well, Jacques.”

“Touch then!”

They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones STOP “No dinner?”

“Nothing but supper now,” said the mender of roads, with a hungry face STOP “It is the fashion,” growled the man STOP “I meet no dinner anywhere.”

He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and
steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held
it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and
thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke STOP “Touch then.” It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
time, after observing these operations STOP They again joined hands STOP “To-night?” said the mender of roads STOP “To-night,” said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth STOP “Where?”

“Here.”

He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at
one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge
of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village STOP “Show me!” said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill STOP “See!” returned the mender of roads, with extended finger STOP “You go down
here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--”

“To the Devil with all that!” interrupted the other, rolling his eye
over the landscape STOP “_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains STOP Well?”

“Well STOP About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the
village.”

“Good STOP When do you cease to work?”

“At sunset.”

“Will you wake me, before departing STOP I have walked two nights without
resting STOP Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child STOP Will you
wake me?”

“Surely.”

The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his
great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones STOP He
was fast asleep directly STOP As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling
away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to
by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap
now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the
heap of stones STOP His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used
his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account STOP The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen
red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of
beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen
and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender
of roads with awe STOP The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were
footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed
with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long
leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into
sores STOP Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at
secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept
with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips STOP Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and
drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against
this figure STOP And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and
looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no
obstacle, tending to centres all over France STOP The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of
brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps
of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed
them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing STOP Then,
the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready
to go down into the village, roused him STOP “Good!” said the sleeper, rising on his elbow STOP “Two leagues beyond the
summit of the hill?”

“About.”

“About STOP Good!”

The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him
according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain,
squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and
appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village STOP When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,
as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there STOP A
curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered
together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of
looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only STOP Monsieur Gabelle,
chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top
alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his
chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to
the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need
to ring the tocsin by-and-bye STOP The night deepened STOP The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its
solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened
the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom STOP Up the two terrace
flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a
swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through
the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the
stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis
had slept STOP East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four
heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the
branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard STOP Four
lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all
was black again STOP But, not for long STOP Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely
visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous STOP Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,
picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,
and windows were STOP Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter STOP Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the
stone faces awakened, stared out of fire STOP A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left
there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away STOP There was
spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the
space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur
Gabelle's door STOP “Help, Gabelle STOP Help, every one!” The tocsin rang
impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none STOP The
mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood
with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the
sky STOP “It must be forty feet high,” said they, grimly; and never moved STOP The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away
through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on
the crag STOP At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;
removed from them, a group of soldiers STOP “Help, gentlemen--officers STOP The
chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by
timely aid STOP Help, help!” The officers looked towards the soldiers who
looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting
of lips, “It must burn.”

As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the
village was illuminating STOP The mender of roads, and the two hundred and
fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of
lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in
every dull little pane of glass STOP The general scarcity of everything,
occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of
Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on
that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to
authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,
and that post-horses would roast STOP The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn STOP In the roaring and
raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the
infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away STOP With the rising
and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in
torment STOP When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the
two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke
again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake
and contending with the fire STOP The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,
scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce
figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke STOP Molten
lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran
dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the
heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame STOP Great rents and
splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied
birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures
trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded
roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next
destination STOP The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,
abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy STOP Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and
bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment
of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter
days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his
house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference STOP Whereupon,
Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel
with himself STOP The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again
withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time
resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man
of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the
parapet, and crush a man or two below STOP Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the
distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door,
combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an
ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,
which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour STOP A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of
the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur
Gabelle had resolved STOP But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the
rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,
and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that
while STOP Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were
other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom
the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they
had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople
less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the
functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up
in their turn STOP But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,
North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned STOP The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it,
no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate
successfully STOP XXIV STOP Drawn to the Loadstone Rock


In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by
the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the
flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on
the shore--three years of tempest were consumed STOP Three more birthdays
of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful
tissue of the life of her home STOP Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in
the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging
feet STOP For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of
a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in
danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted
in STOP Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of
his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as
to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and
this life together STOP Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with
infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could
ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after
boldly reading the Lord's Prayer backwards for a great number of years,
and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no
sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels STOP The shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the
mark for a hurricane of national bullets STOP It had never been a good
eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride,
Sardanapalus's luxury, and a mole's blindness--but it had dropped
out and was gone STOP The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its
outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was
all gone together STOP Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and
“suspended,” when the last tidings came over STOP The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was
come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide STOP As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of
Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank STOP Spirits are supposed to
haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur
without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be STOP Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most
to be relied upon, came quickest STOP Again: Tellson's was a munificent
house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen
from their high estate STOP Again: those nobles who had seen the coming
storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made
provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there
by their needy brethren STOP To which it must be added that every new-comer
from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson's, almost as
a matter of course STOP For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that
time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this
was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in
consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news
out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran
through Temple Bar to read STOP On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles
Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice STOP The
penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now
the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing STOP It was within half an
hour or so of the time of closing STOP “But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,” said Charles
Darnay, rather hesitating, “I must still suggest to you--”

“I understand STOP That I am too old?” said Mr. Lorry STOP “Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a
disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.”

“My dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, “you touch
some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away STOP It is safe
enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard
upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth
interfering with STOP As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a
disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our
House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of
old, and is in Tellson's confidence STOP As to the uncertain travelling, the
long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit
myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson's, after all
these years, who ought to be?”

“I wish I were going myself,” said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly,
and like one thinking aloud STOP “Indeed STOP You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!” exclaimed Mr.
Lorry STOP “You wish you were going yourself STOP And you a Frenchman born STOP You
are a wise counsellor.”

“My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the
thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through
my mind often STOP One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for
the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them,” he spoke
here in his former thoughtful manner, “that one might be listened to,
and might have the power to persuade to some restraint STOP Only last night,
after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--”

“When you were talking to Lucie,” Mr. Lorry repeated STOP “Yes STOP I wonder you
are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie STOP Wishing you were going to
France at this time of day!”

“However, I am not going,” said Charles Darnay, with a smile STOP “It is
more to the purpose that you say you are.”

“And I am, in plain reality STOP The truth is, my dear Charles,” Mr. Lorry
glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, “you can have no
conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and
of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved STOP The
Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers
of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they
might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set
afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow STOP Now, a judicious selection from these
with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise
getting of them out of harm's way, is within the power (without loss of
precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one STOP And shall
I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says this--Tellson's, whose
bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about
the joints STOP Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!”

“How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.”

“Tut STOP Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, glancing at
the House again, “you are to remember, that getting things out of
Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an
impossibility STOP Papers and precious matters were this very day brought
to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to
whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine,
every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed
the Barriers STOP At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily
as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.”

“And do you really go to-night?”

“I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of
delay.”

“And do you take no one with you?”

“All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing
to say to any of them STOP I intend to take Jerry STOP Jerry has been my
bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him STOP Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or
of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his
master.”

“I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and
youthfulness.”

“I must say again, nonsense, nonsense STOP When I have executed this little
commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson's proposal to retire and
live at my ease STOP Time enough, then, to think about growing old.”

This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry's usual desk, with
Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he
would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long STOP It was too
much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it
was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this
terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under
the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or
omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched
millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that
should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming,
years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw STOP Such
vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the
restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself,
and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured
without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth STOP And it was
such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood
in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had
already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so STOP Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his
way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching
to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating
them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for
accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition
of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race STOP Him, Darnay heard
with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between
going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his
word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out STOP The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter
before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to
whom it was addressed STOP The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay
that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right
name STOP The address, turned into English, ran:

“Very pressing STOP To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of
France STOP Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,
London, England.”

On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and
express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should
be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate
between them STOP Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no
suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none STOP “No,” said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; “I have referred it,
I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this
gentleman is to be found.”

The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there
was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry's desk STOP He
held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the
person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at
it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That,
and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in
English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found STOP “Nephew, I believe--but in any case degenerate successor--of the
polished Marquis who was murdered,” said one STOP “Happy to say, I never
knew him.”

“A craven who abandoned his post,” said another--this Monseigneur had
been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of
hay--“some years ago.”

“Infected with the new doctrines,” said a third, eyeing the direction
through his glass in passing; “set himself in opposition to the last
Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to
the ruffian herd STOP They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves.”

“Hey?” cried the blatant Stryver STOP “Did he though STOP Is that the sort of
fellow STOP Let us look at his infamous name STOP D--n the fellow!”

Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on
the shoulder, and said:

“I know the fellow.”

“Do you, by Jupiter?” said Stryver STOP “I am sorry for it.”

“Why?”

“Why, Mr. Darnay STOP D'ye hear what he did STOP Don't ask, why, in these
times.”

“But I do ask why?”

“Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it STOP I am sorry to
hear you putting any such extraordinary questions STOP Here is a fellow,
who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that
ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth
that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a
man who instructs youth knows him STOP Well, but I'll answer you STOP I am sorry
because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel STOP That's
why.”

Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and
said: “You may not understand the gentleman.”

“I understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay,” said Bully
Stryver, “and I'll do it STOP If this fellow is a gentleman, I _don't_
understand him STOP You may tell him so, with my compliments STOP You may also
tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position
to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them STOP But, no,
gentlemen,” said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers,
“I know something of human nature, and I tell you that you'll never
find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such
precious _protégés_ STOP No, gentlemen; he'll always show 'em a clean pair
of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.”

With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver
shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of
his hearers STOP Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk,
in the general departure from the Bank STOP “Will you take charge of the letter?” said Mr. Lorry STOP “You know where to
deliver it?”

“I do.”

“Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been
addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and
that it has been here some time?”

“I will do so STOP Do you start for Paris from here?”

“From here, at eight.”

“I will come back, to see you off.”

Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men,
Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the
letter, and read it STOP These were its contents:


“Prison of the Abbaye, Paris STOP “June 21, 1792 STOP “MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS STOP “After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the
village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and
brought a long journey on foot to Paris STOP On the road I have suffered a
great deal STOP Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the
ground STOP “The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my
life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against
the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an
emigrant STOP It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not
against, according to your commands STOP It is in vain I represent that,
before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the
imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had
had recourse to no process STOP The only response is, that I have acted for
an emigrant, and where is that emigrant STOP “Ah STOP most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that
emigrant STOP I cry in my sleep where is he STOP I demand of Heaven, will he
not come to deliver me STOP No answer STOP Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your
ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris STOP “For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to
succour and release me STOP My fault is, that I have been true to you STOP Oh
Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me STOP “From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and
nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the
assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service STOP “Your afflicted,

“Gabelle.”


The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life
by this letter STOP The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose
only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so
reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple
considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby STOP He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated
the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his
resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his
conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold,
he had acted imperfectly STOP He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie,
his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own
mind, had been hurried and incomplete STOP He knew that he ought to have
systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to
do it, and that it had never been done STOP The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being
always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time
which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week
annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week
following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of
these circumstances he had yielded:--not without disquiet, but still
without continuous and accumulating resistance STOP That he had watched
the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled
until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from
France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of
confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out,
was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in
France that might impeach him for it STOP But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so
far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had
relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no
favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own
bread STOP Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate
on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little
there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in
the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his
own safety, so that it could not but appear now STOP This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make,
that he would go to Paris STOP Yes STOP Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven
him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him
to itself, and he must go STOP Everything that arose before his mind drifted
him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible
attraction STOP His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being
worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who
could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there,
trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity STOP With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching
him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison
(injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,
which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were
coarse and galling, for old reasons STOP Upon those, had followed Gabelle's
letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his
justice, honour, and good name STOP His resolution was made STOP He must go to Paris STOP Yes STOP The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he
struck STOP He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger STOP The intention
with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left
it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be
gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert
it STOP Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the
sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even
saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging
Revolution that was running so fearfully wild STOP As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that
neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone STOP Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always
reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old,
should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in
the balance of suspense and doubt STOP How much of the incompleteness of his
situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety
to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not
discuss with himself STOP But, that circumstance too, had had its influence
in his course STOP He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to
return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry STOP As soon as he arrived
in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say
nothing of his intention now STOP A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was
booted and equipped STOP “I have delivered that letter,” said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry STOP “I
would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but
perhaps you will take a verbal one?”

“That I will, and readily,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it is not dangerous.”

“Not at all STOP Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.”

“What is his name?” said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his
hand STOP “Gabelle.”

“Gabelle STOP And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?”

“Simply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come STOP '”

“Any time mentioned?”

“He will start upon his journey to-morrow night.”

“Any person mentioned?”

“No.”

He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks,
and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the
misty air of Fleet-street STOP “My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,” said
Mr. Lorry at parting, “and take precious care of them till I come back.”
 Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage
rolled away STOP That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote
two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation
he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons
that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and
their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the
strongest assurances STOP To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters
in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival STOP It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first
reservation of their joint lives on his mind STOP It was a hard matter to
preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious STOP But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him
resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it,
so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and
the day passed quickly STOP Early in the evening he embraced her, and her
scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye
(an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise
of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy
streets, with a heavier heart STOP The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides
and winds were setting straight and strong towards it STOP He left his
two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before
midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey STOP “For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
your noble name!” was the poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened
his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and
floated away for the Loadstone Rock STOP The end of the second book STOP Book the Third--the Track of a Storm




I STOP In Secret


The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from
England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and
ninety-two STOP More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad
horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and
unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory;
but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than
these STOP Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of
citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state
of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them,
inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own,
turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in
hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning
Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or
Death STOP A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles
Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there
was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen
at Paris STOP Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey's end STOP Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across
the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in
the series that was barred between him and England STOP The universal
watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net,
or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have
felt his freedom more completely gone STOP This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by
riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him
by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge STOP He had been
days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in
a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris STOP Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his
prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far STOP His difficulty at the
guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey
to have come to a crisis STOP And he was, therefore, as little surprised as
a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night STOP Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough
red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed STOP “Emigrant,” said the functionary, “I am going to send you on to Paris,
under an escort.”

“Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could
dispense with the escort.”

“Silence!” growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end
of his musket STOP “Peace, aristocrat!”

“It is as the good patriot says,” observed the timid functionary STOP “You
are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it.”

“I have no choice,” said Charles Darnay STOP “Choice STOP Listen to him!” cried the same scowling red-cap STOP “As if it was
not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!”

“It is always as the good patriot says,” observed the functionary STOP “Rise
and dress yourself, emigrant.”

Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other
patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by
a watch-fire STOP Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he
started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o'clock in the morning STOP The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured
cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either
side of him STOP The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to
his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his
wrist STOP In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their
faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,
and out upon the mire-deep roads STOP In this state they traversed without
change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay
between them and the capital STOP They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and
lying by until the twilight fell STOP The escort were so wretchedly clothed,
that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged
shoulders to keep the wet off STOP Apart from the personal discomfort of
being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger
as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying
his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint
that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for,
he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,
confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made STOP But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide,
when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from
himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming STOP An ominous crowd
gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called
out loudly, “Down with the emigrant!”

He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,
resuming it as his safest place, said:

“Emigrant, my friends STOP Do you not see me here, in France, of my own
will?”

“You are a cursed emigrant,” cried a farrier, making at him in a
furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; “and you are a cursed
aristocrat!”

The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's
bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, “Let him
be; let him be STOP He will be judged at Paris.”

“Judged!” repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer STOP “Ay STOP and condemned
as a traitor.” At this the crowd roared approval STOP Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse's head to the
yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with
the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his
voice heard:

“Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived STOP I am not a
traitor.”

“He lies!” cried the smith STOP “He is a traitor since the decree STOP His life
is forfeit to the people STOP His cursed life is not his own!”

At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which
another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his
horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse's flanks,
and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates STOP The farrier
struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no
more was done STOP “What is this decree that the smith spoke of?” Darnay asked the
postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard STOP “Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.”

“When passed?”

“On the fourteenth.”

“The day I left England!”

“Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be
others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and
condemning all to death who return STOP That is what he meant when he said
your life was not your own.”

“But there are no such decrees yet?”

“What do I know!” said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; “there
may be, or there will be STOP It is all the same STOP What would you have?”

They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and
then rode forward again when all the town was asleep STOP Among the many
wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride
unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep STOP After long and
lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor
cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and
would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,
circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn
up together singing a Liberty song STOP Happily, however, there was sleep in
Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and
wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth
that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by
the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their
way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads STOP Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris STOP The barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it STOP “Where are the papers of this prisoner?” demanded a resolute-looking man
in authority, who was summoned out by the guard STOP Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the
speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen,
in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
imposed upon him, and which he had paid for STOP “Where,” repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him
whatever, “are the papers of this prisoner?”

The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them STOP Casting his
eyes over Gabelle's letter, the same personage in authority showed some
disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention STOP He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went
into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the
gate STOP Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles
Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress
into the city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies, and for similar
traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest
people, was very difficult STOP A numerous medley of men and women, not
to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue
forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they
filtered through the barrier very slowly STOP Some of these people knew
their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the
ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered
about STOP The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men
and women STOP When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these
things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,
who directed the guard to open the barrier STOP Then he delivered to the
escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him
to dismount STOP He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,
turned and rode away without entering the city STOP He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine
and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,
drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and
waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about STOP The
light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of
the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly
uncertain condition STOP Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an
officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these STOP “Citizen Defarge,” said he to Darnay's conductor, as he took a slip of
paper to write on STOP “Is this the emigrant Evremonde?”

“This is the man.”

“Your age, Evremonde?”

“Thirty-seven.”

“Married, Evremonde?”

“Yes.”

“Where married?”

“In England.”

“Without doubt STOP Where is your wife, Evremonde?”

“In England.”

“Without doubt STOP You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La
Force.”

“Just Heaven!” exclaimed Darnay STOP “Under what law, and for what offence?”

The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment STOP “We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here.” He
said it with a hard smile, and went on writing STOP “I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response
to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you STOP I
demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay STOP Is not that
my right?”

“Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde,” was the stolid reply STOP The officer
wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written,
sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words “In secret.”

Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany
him STOP The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended
them STOP “Is it you,” said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the
guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, “who married the daughter of
Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?”

“Yes,” replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise STOP “My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint
Antoine STOP Possibly you have heard of me.”

“My wife came to your house to reclaim her father STOP Yes!”

The word “wife” seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say
with sudden impatience, “In the name of that sharp female newly-born,
and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?”

“You heard me say why, a minute ago STOP Do you not believe it is the
truth?”

“A bad truth for you,” said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and
looking straight before him STOP “Indeed I am lost here STOP All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so
sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost STOP Will you render me a
little help?”

“None.” Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him STOP “Will you answer me a single question?”

“Perhaps STOP According to its nature STOP You can say what it is.”

“In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free
communication with the world outside?”

“You will see.”

“I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of
presenting my case?”

“You will see STOP But, what then STOP Other people have been similarly buried
in worse prisons, before now.”

“But never by me, Citizen Defarge.”

Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady
and set silence STOP The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope
there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree STOP He, therefore, made haste to say:

“It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better
than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to
Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,
the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the
prison of La Force STOP Will you cause that to be done for me?”

“I will do,” Defarge doggedly rejoined, “nothing for you STOP My duty is to
my country and the People STOP I am the sworn servant of both, against you STOP I will do nothing for you.”

Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride
was touched besides STOP As they walked on in silence, he could not but see
how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
streets STOP The very children scarcely noticed him STOP A few passers turned
their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;
otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no
more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
going to work STOP In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they
passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited
audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal
family STOP The few words that he caught from this man's lips, first made
it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the
foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris STOP On the road (except at
Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing STOP The escort and the universal
watchfulness had completely isolated him STOP That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now STOP That
perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster
yet, he of course knew now STOP He could not but admit to himself that he
might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events
of a few days STOP And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by
the light of this later time, they would appear STOP Troubled as the future
was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant
hope STOP The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few
rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed
garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had
been a hundred thousand years away STOP The “sharp female newly-born, and
called La Guillotine,” was hardly known to him, or to the generality
of people, by name STOP The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were
probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers STOP How could
they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind STOP Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation
from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the
certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly STOP With this on
his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he
arrived at the prison of La Force STOP A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge
presented “The Emigrant Evremonde.”

“What the Devil STOP How many more of them!” exclaimed the man with the
bloated face STOP Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew,
with his two fellow-patriots STOP “What the Devil, I say again!” exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife STOP “How many more!”

The gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely
replied, “One must have patience, my dear!” Three turnkeys who entered
responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, “For
the love of Liberty;” which sounded in that place like an inappropriate
conclusion STOP The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a
horrible smell of foul sleep in it STOP Extraordinary how soon the noisome
flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that
are ill cared for STOP “In secret, too,” grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper STOP “As
if I was not already full to bursting!”

He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay
awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and
fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in
either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his
subordinates STOP “Come!” said the chief, at length taking up his keys, “come with me,
emigrant.”

Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by
corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,
until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with
prisoners of both sexes STOP The women were seated at a long table, reading
and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the
most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the
room STOP In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company STOP But the crowning
unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to
receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with
all the engaging graces and courtesies of life STOP So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and
gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and
misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand
in a company of the dead STOP Ghosts all STOP The ghost of beauty, the ghost
of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of
frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all
waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes
that were changed by the death they had died in coming there STOP It struck him motionless STOP The gaoler standing at his side, and the other
gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance
in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly
coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were
there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the
mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and
likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its
utmost STOP Surely, ghosts all STOP Surely, the long unreal ride some progress
of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades STOP “In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,” said a
gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, “I have the
honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you
on the calamity that has brought you among us STOP May it soon terminate
happily STOP It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,
to ask your name and condition?”

Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in
words as suitable as he could find STOP “But I hope,” said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his
eyes, who moved across the room, “that you are not in secret?”

“I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say
so.”

“Ah, what a pity STOP We so much regret it STOP But take courage; several
members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted
but a short time.” Then he added, raising his voice, “I grieve to inform
the society--in secret.”

There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room
to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among
which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave
him good wishes and encouragement STOP He turned at the grated door, to
render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler's hand; and
the apparitions vanished from his sight forever STOP The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward STOP When they had
ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted
them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a
solitary cell STOP It struck cold and damp, but was not dark STOP “Yours,” said the gaoler STOP “Why am I confined alone?”

“How do I know!”

“I can buy pen, ink, and paper?”

“Such are not my orders STOP You will be visited, and can ask then STOP At
present, you may buy your food, and nothing more.”

There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress STOP As
the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four
walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of
the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler
was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like
a man who had been drowned and filled with water STOP When the gaoler was
gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if I were
dead.” Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it
with a sick feeling, and thought, “And here in these crawling creatures
is the first condition of the body after death.”

“Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five
paces by four and a half.” The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,
counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled
drums with a wild swell of voices added to them STOP “He made shoes, he made
shoes, he made shoes.” The prisoner counted the measurement again, and
paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition STOP “The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed STOP There was one among
them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the
embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden
hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God's sake,
through the illuminated villages with the people all awake STOP * * * * He
made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes STOP * * * * Five paces by four and
a half.” With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of
his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting
and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it
still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he
knew, in the swell that rose above them STOP II STOP The Grindstone


Tellson's Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was
in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from
the street by a high wall and a strong gate STOP The house belonged to
a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the
troubles, in his own cook's dress, and got across the borders STOP A
mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his
metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation
of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men
besides the cook in question STOP Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the
sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and
willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and
indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's
house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated STOP For, all
things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce
precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month
of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of
Monseigneur's house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were
drinking brandy in its state apartments STOP A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris,
would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette STOP For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have
said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid
over the counter STOP Yet such things were STOP Tellson's had whitewashed the
Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest
linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to
night STOP Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in
Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of
the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and
also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest
provocation STOP Yet, a French Tellson's could get on with these things
exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had
taken fright at them, and drawn out his money STOP What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what would
lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in
Tellson's hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons,
and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with
Tellson's never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into
the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis
Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions STOP He sat by
a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was
prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a
deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the
room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror STOP He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which
he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy STOP It chanced that they
derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main
building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about
that STOP All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did
his duty STOP On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,
was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages
of Monseigneur yet stood STOP Against two of the pillars were fastened two
great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the
open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared
to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,
or other workshop STOP Rising and looking out of window at these harmless
objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire STOP He had
opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and
he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame STOP From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came
the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring
in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible
nature were going up to Heaven STOP “Thank God,” said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, “that no one near and
dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night STOP May He have mercy on all
who are in danger!”

Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,
“They have come back!” and sat listening STOP But, there was no loud
irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate
clash again, and all was quiet STOP The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague
uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally
awaken, with such feelings roused STOP It was well guarded, and he got up to
go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly
opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in
amazement STOP Lucie and her father STOP Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with
that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it
seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give
force and power to it in this one passage of her life STOP “What is this?” cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused STOP “What is the
matter STOP Lucie STOP Manette STOP What has happened STOP What has brought you here STOP What is it?”

With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted
out in his arms, imploringly, “O my dear friend STOP My husband!”

“Your husband, Lucie?”

“Charles.”

“What of Charles?”

“Here STOP “Here, in Paris?”

“Has been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't
collect my thoughts STOP An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to
us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.”

The old man uttered an irrepressible cry STOP Almost at the same moment, the
bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices
came pouring into the courtyard STOP “What is that noise?” said the Doctor, turning towards the window STOP “Don't look!” cried Mr. Lorry STOP “Don't look out STOP Manette, for your life,
don't touch the blind!”

The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and
said, with a cool, bold smile:

“My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city STOP I have been
a Bastille prisoner STOP There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris STOP In
France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would
touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph STOP My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the
barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here STOP I
knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I
told Lucie so.--What is that noise?” His hand was again upon the window STOP “Don't look!” cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate STOP “No, Lucie, my
dear, nor you!” He got his arm round her, and held her STOP “Don't be so
terrified, my love STOP I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm
having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in
this fatal place STOP What prison is he in?”

“La Force!”

“La Force STOP Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in
your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to
do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or
I can say STOP There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night;
you cannot possibly stir out STOP I say this, because what I must bid you
to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all STOP You must
instantly be obedient, still, and quiet STOP You must let me put you in a
room at the back here STOP You must leave your father and me alone for
two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not
delay.”

“I will be submissive to you STOP I see in your face that you know I can do
nothing else than this STOP I know you are true.”

The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the
key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and
partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor's arm, and
looked out with him into the courtyard STOP Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near
enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all STOP The
people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they
had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up
there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot STOP But, such awful workers, and such awful work STOP The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two
men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of
the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than
the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise STOP False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their
hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with
howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of
sleep STOP As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung
forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women
held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping
blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks
struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and
fire STOP The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from
the smear of blood STOP Shouldering one another to get next at the
sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all
over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain
upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace
and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through
and through STOP Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be
sharpened, were all red with it STOP Some of the hacked swords were tied to
the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments
of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour STOP And
as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream
of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in
their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have
given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun STOP All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of
any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it
were there STOP They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for
explanation in his friend's ashy face STOP “They are,” Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at
the locked room, “murdering the prisoners STOP If you are sure of what you
say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you
have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force STOP It
may be too late, I don't know, but let it not be a minute later!”

Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room,
and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind STOP His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous
confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water,
carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone STOP For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and
the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,
surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all
linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with
cries of--“Live the Bastille prisoner STOP Help for the Bastille prisoner's
kindred in La Force STOP Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there STOP Save
the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!” and a thousand answering shouts STOP He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window
and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was
assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband STOP He found
her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be
surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat
watching them in such quiet as the night knew STOP Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,
clinging to his hand STOP Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own
bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty
charge STOP O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife STOP And O
the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings STOP Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the
irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered STOP “What is it?” cried Lucie, affrighted STOP “Hush STOP The soldiers' swords are
sharpened there,” said Mr. Lorry STOP “The place is national property now,
and used as a kind of armoury, my love.”

Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful STOP Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself
from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again STOP A man, so
besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back
to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by
the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air STOP Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of
the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,
climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its
dainty cushions STOP The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again,
and the sun was red on the courtyard STOP But, the lesser grindstone stood
alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had
never given, and would never take away STOP III STOP The Shadow


One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.
Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to
imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
the Bank roof STOP His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded
for Lucie and her child, without a moment's demur; but the great trust
he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict
man of business STOP At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out
the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to
the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city STOP But, the
same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the
most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in
its dangerous workings STOP Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay
tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie STOP She said
that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that
Quarter, near the Banking-house STOP As there was no business objection to
this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and
he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry
went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up
in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes STOP To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:
giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself STOP He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear
considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations STOP A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly
and heavily the day lagged on with him STOP It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed STOP He
was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to
do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair STOP In a few moments, a
man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,
addressed him by his name STOP “Your servant,” said Mr. Lorry STOP “Do you know me?”

He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five
to fifty years of age STOP For answer he repeated, without any change of
emphasis, the words:

“Do you know me?”

“I have seen you somewhere.”

“Perhaps at my wine-shop?”

Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: “You come from Doctor
Manette?”

“Yes STOP I come from Doctor Manette.”

“And what says he STOP What does he send me?”

Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper STOP It bore the
words in the Doctor's writing:

    “Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet STOP I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note
     from Charles to his wife STOP Let the bearer see his wife.”

It was dated from La Force, within an hour STOP “Will you accompany me,” said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading
this note aloud, “to where his wife resides?”

“Yes,” returned Defarge STOP Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical
way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the
courtyard STOP There, they found two women; one, knitting STOP “Madame Defarge, surely!” said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly
the same attitude some seventeen years ago STOP “It is she,” observed her husband STOP “Does Madame go with us?” inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as
they moved STOP “Yes STOP That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons STOP It is for their safety.”

Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously
at him, and led the way STOP Both the women followed; the second woman being
The Vengeance STOP They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,
ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,
and found Lucie weeping, alone STOP She was thrown into a transport by the
tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that
delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in
the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him STOP “DEAREST,--Take courage STOP I am well, and your father has
      influence around me STOP You cannot answer this STOP Kiss our child for me.”

That was all the writing STOP It was so much, however, to her who received
it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the
hands that knitted STOP It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly
action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took
to its knitting again STOP There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check STOP She stopped in
the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her
neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge STOP Madame Defarge met the lifted
eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare STOP “My dear,” said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; “there are frequent
risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever
trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power
to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she
may identify them STOP I believe,” said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his
reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself
upon him more and more, “I state the case, Citizen Defarge?”

Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a
gruff sound of acquiescence STOP “You had better, Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to
propitiate, by tone and manner, “have the dear child here, and our
good Pross STOP Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no
French.”

The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a
match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,
appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance,
whom her eyes first encountered, “Well, I am sure, Boldface STOP I hope
_you_ are pretty well!” She also bestowed a British cough on Madame
Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her STOP “Is that his child?” said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the
first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it
were the finger of Fate STOP “Yes, madame,” answered Mr. Lorry; “this is our poor prisoner's darling
daughter, and only child.”

The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so
threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively
kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast STOP The
shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall,
threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child STOP “It is enough, my husband,” said Madame Defarge STOP “I have seen them STOP We
may go.”

But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and
presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as
she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress:

“You will be good to my poor husband STOP You will do him no harm STOP You will
help me to see him if you can?”

“Your husband is not my business here,” returned Madame Defarge, looking
down at her with perfect composure STOP “It is the daughter of your father
who is my business here.”

“For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband STOP For my child's sake STOP She
will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful STOP We are more
afraid of you than of these others.”

Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband STOP Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her,
collected his face into a sterner expression STOP “What is it that your husband says in that little letter?” asked Madame
Defarge, with a lowering smile STOP “Influence; he says something touching
influence?”

“That my father,” said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her
breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, “has
much influence around him.”

“Surely it will release him!” said Madame Defarge STOP “Let it do so.”

“As a wife and mother,” cried Lucie, most earnestly, “I implore you to
have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against
my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf STOP O sister-woman, think
of me STOP As a wife and mother!”

Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,
turning to her friend The Vengeance:

“The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little
as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered STOP We have
known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,
often enough STOP All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in
themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,
sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?”

“We have seen nothing else,” returned The Vengeance STOP “We have borne this a long time,” said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes
again upon Lucie STOP “Judge you STOP Is it likely that the trouble of one wife
and mother would be much to us now?”

She resumed her knitting and went out STOP The Vengeance followed STOP Defarge
went last, and closed the door STOP “Courage, my dear Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her STOP “Courage,
courage STOP So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of
late gone with many poor souls STOP Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.”

“I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a
shadow on me and on all my hopes.”

“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Lorry; “what is this despondency in the brave
little breast STOP A shadow indeed STOP No substance in it, Lucie.”

But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself,
for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly STOP IV STOP Calm in Storm


Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
absence STOP So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that
not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she
know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been
darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been
tainted by the slain STOP She only knew that there had been an attack upon
the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that
some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered STOP To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on
which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a
scene of carnage to the prison of La Force STOP That, in the prison he had
found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were
brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth
to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back
to their cells STOP That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he
had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen
years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the
body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this
man was Defarge STOP That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table,
that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard
to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some
dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life
and liberty STOP That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded
to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and
examined STOP That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when
the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible
to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference STOP That,
the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that
the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held
inviolate in safe custody STOP That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner
was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the
Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,
delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and
had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over STOP The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by
intervals, shall remain untold STOP The mad joy over the prisoners who were
saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
those who were cut to pieces STOP One prisoner there was, he said, who had
been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had
thrust a pike as he passed out STOP Being besought to go to him and dress
the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him
in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies
of their victims STOP With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this
awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man
with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him
carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged
anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes
with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it STOP As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of
his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that
such dread experiences would revive the old danger STOP But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never
at all known him in his present character STOP For the first time the Doctor
felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power STOP For the first time
he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which
could break the prison door of his daughter's husband, and deliver him STOP “It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin STOP As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be
helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid
of Heaven I will do it!” Thus, Doctor Manette STOP And when Jarvis Lorry saw
the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing
of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a
clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which
had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed STOP Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would
have yielded before his persevering purpose STOP While he kept himself
in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees
of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his
personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician
of three prisons, and among them of La Force STOP He could now assure Lucie
that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the
general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet
messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself
sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand), but she was
not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of
plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad STOP This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the
sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it STOP Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;
but he observed it as a curiosity STOP The Doctor knew, that up to that
time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter
and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness STOP Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through
that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's
ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change,
that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to
trust to him as the strong STOP The preceding relative positions of himself
and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and
affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in
rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him STOP “All
curious to see,” thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, “but all
natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it
couldn't be in better hands.”

But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get
Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,
the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him STOP The new
era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death
against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the
great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise
against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils
of France, as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and
had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and
alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of
the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds
and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the
fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore STOP What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year
One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above,
and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened STOP There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no
measurement of time STOP Though days and nights circled as regularly as when
time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other
count of time there was none STOP Hold of it was lost in the raging fever
of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient STOP Now, breaking the
unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the
head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the
head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
widowhood and misery, to turn it grey STOP And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in
all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast STOP A
revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand
revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected,
which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over
any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged
with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing;
these things became the established order and nature of appointed
things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old STOP Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before
the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the
sharp female called La Guillotine STOP It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,
it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a
peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which
shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window
and sneezed into the sack STOP It was the sign of the regeneration of the
human race STOP It superseded the Cross STOP Models of it were worn on breasts
from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and
believed in where the Cross was denied STOP It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted,
were a rotten red STOP It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young
Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it STOP It hushed
the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and
good STOP Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one
dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes STOP The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief
functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his
namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God's own Temple every
day STOP Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked
with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his
end, never doubting that he would save Lucie's husband at last STOP Yet the
current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time
away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three
months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident STOP So much more
wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,
that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the
violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares
under the southern wintry sun STOP Still, the Doctor walked among the
terrors with a steady head STOP No man better known than he, in Paris at
that day; no man in a stranger situation STOP Silent, humane, indispensable
in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and
victims, he was a man apart STOP In the exercise of his skill, the
appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all
other men STOP He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if
he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were
a Spirit moving among mortals STOP V. The Wood-Sawyer


One year and three months STOP During all that time Lucie was never
sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her
husband's head next day STOP Every day, through the stony streets, the
tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned STOP Lovely girls; bright
women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and
old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all
daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons,
and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst STOP Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to
bestow, O Guillotine STOP If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time,
had stunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle
despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many STOP But, from
the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in
the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties STOP She was
truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good
will always be STOP As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father
had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little
household as exactly as if her husband had been there STOP Everything had
its appointed place and its appointed time STOP Little Lucie she taught,
as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home STOP The
slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief
that they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his speedy
return, the setting aside of his chair and his books--these, and the
solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many
unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only
outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind STOP She did not greatly alter in appearance STOP The plain dark dresses, akin to
mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well
attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days STOP She lost her colour,
and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional,
thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely STOP Sometimes, at
night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had
repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven,
was on him STOP He always resolutely answered: “Nothing can happen to him
without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie.”

They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her
father said to her, on coming home one evening:

“My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can
sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon STOP When he can get to
it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you
in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can
show you STOP But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even
if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.”

“O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.”

From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours STOP As the
clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away STOP When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they
went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a
single day STOP It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street STOP The hovel
of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that
end; all else was wall STOP On the third day of her being there, he noticed
her STOP “Good day, citizeness.”

“Good day, citizen.”

This mode of address was now prescribed by decree STOP It had been
established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots;
but, was now law for everybody STOP “Walking here again, citizeness?”

“You see me, citizen!”

The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he
had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison, pointed
at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent
bars, peeped through them jocosely STOP “But it's not my business,” said he STOP And went on sawing his wood STOP Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she
appeared STOP “What STOP Walking here again, citizeness?”

“Yes, citizen.”

“Ah STOP A child too STOP Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?”

“Do I say yes, mamma?” whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her STOP “Yes, dearest.”

“Yes, citizen.”

“Ah STOP But it's not my business STOP My work is my business STOP See my saw STOP I
call it my Little Guillotine STOP La, la, la; La, la, la STOP And off his head
comes!”

The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket STOP “I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine STOP See here again STOP Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo STOP And off _her_ head comes STOP Now, a child STOP Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle STOP And off _its_ head comes STOP All the
family!”

Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was
impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in
his sight STOP Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him
first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received STOP He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten
him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart
up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her,
with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work STOP “But it's
not my business!” he would generally say at those times, and would
briskly fall to his sawing again STOP In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of
spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again
in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at
this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall STOP Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in
five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not
for a week or a fortnight together STOP It was enough that he could and did
see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have
waited out the day, seven days a week STOP These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her
father walked among the terrors with a steady head STOP On a lightly-snowing
afternoon she arrived at the usual corner STOP It was a day of some wild
rejoicing, and a festival STOP She had seen the houses, as she came along,
decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them;
also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription
(tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible STOP Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death STOP The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole
surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend STOP He had got
somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in
with most inappropriate difficulty STOP On his house-top, he displayed pike
and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his
saw inscribed as his “Little Sainte Guillotine”--for the great sharp
female was by that time popularly canonised STOP His shop was shut and he
was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone STOP But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement
and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear STOP A moment
afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the
prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with
The Vengeance STOP There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and
they were dancing like five thousand demons STOP There was no other music
than their own singing STOP They danced to the popular Revolution song,
keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison STOP Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced
together, as hazard had brought them together STOP At first, they were a
mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they
filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly
apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them STOP They
advanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one
another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round
in pairs, until many of them dropped STOP While those were down, the rest
linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,
and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then
reversed the spin, and all spun round another way STOP Suddenly they stopped
again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width
of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high
up, swooped screaming off STOP No fight could have been half so terrible
as this dance STOP It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once
innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into
a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the
heart STOP Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how
warped and perverted all things good by nature were become STOP The maidenly
bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted, the
delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of
the disjointed time STOP This was the Carmagnole STOP As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and
bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer's house, the feathery snow
fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been STOP “O my father!” for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she
had momentarily darkened with her hand; “such a cruel, bad sight.”

“I know, my dear, I know STOP I have seen it many times STOP Don't be
frightened STOP Not one of them would harm you.”

“I am not frightened for myself, my father STOP But when I think of my
husband, and the mercies of these people--”

“We will set him above their mercies very soon STOP I left him climbing to
the window, and I came to tell you STOP There is no one here to see STOP You may
kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.”

“I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!”

“You cannot see him, my poor dear?”

“No, father,” said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand,
“no.”

A footstep in the snow STOP Madame Defarge STOP “I salute you, citizeness,”
 from the Doctor STOP “I salute you, citizen.” This in passing STOP Nothing more STOP Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road STOP “Give me your arm, my love STOP Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness
and courage, for his sake STOP That was well done;” they had left the spot;
“it shall not be in vain STOP Charles is summoned for to-morrow.”

“For to-morrow!”

“There is no time to lose STOP I am well prepared, but there are precautions
to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned
before the Tribunal STOP He has not received the notice yet, but I know
that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the
Conciergerie; I have timely information STOP You are not afraid?”

She could scarcely answer, “I trust in you.”

“Do so, implicitly STOP Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall
be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him with every
protection STOP I must see Lorry.”

He stopped STOP There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing STOP They
both knew too well what it meant STOP One STOP Two STOP Three STOP Three tumbrils faring
away with their dread loads over the hushing snow STOP “I must see Lorry,” the Doctor repeated, turning her another way STOP The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it STOP He
and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated
and made national STOP What he could save for the owners, he saved STOP No
better man living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping, and to
hold his peace STOP A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted
the approach of darkness STOP It was almost dark when they arrived at the
Bank STOP The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and
deserted STOP Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters:
National Property STOP Republic One and Indivisible STOP Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity, or Death STOP Who could that be with Mr. Lorry--the owner of the riding-coat upon the
chair--who must not be seen STOP From whom newly arrived, did he come out,
agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms STOP To whom did
he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and
turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued,
he said: “Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?”




VI STOP Triumph


The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined
Jury, sat every day STOP Their lists went forth every evening, and were
read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners STOP The
standard gaoler-joke was, “Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you
inside there!”

“Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!”

So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force STOP When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved
for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded STOP Charles
Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen
hundreds pass away so STOP His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them
to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the
list, making a similar short pause at each name STOP There were twenty-three
names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so
summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been
guillotined and forgotten STOP The list was read, in the vaulted chamber
where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his
arrival STOP Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human
creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the
scaffold STOP There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was
soon over STOP It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force
were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little
concert, for that evening STOP They crowded to the grates and shed tears
there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be
refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the
common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs
who kept watch there through the night STOP The prisoners were far from
insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the
time STOP Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour
or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to
brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere
boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind STOP In
seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the
disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it STOP And all of us have
like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke
them STOP The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its
vermin-haunted cells was long and cold STOP Next day, fifteen prisoners were
put to the bar before Charles Darnay's name was called STOP All the fifteen
were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half STOP “Charles Evremonde, called Darnay,” was at length arraigned STOP His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap
and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing STOP Looking
at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the
usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the
honest men STOP The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never
without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing
spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,
anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check STOP Of the men,
the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore
knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many
knitted STOP Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under
her arm as she worked STOP She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom
he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly
remembered as Defarge STOP He noticed that she once or twice whispered in
his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed
in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to
himself as they could be, they never looked towards him STOP They seemed to
be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at
the Jury, but at nothing else STOP Under the President sat Doctor Manette,
in his usual quiet dress STOP As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.
Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who
wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
Carmagnole STOP Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor
as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree
which banished all emigrants on pain of Death STOP It was nothing that the
decree bore date since his return to France STOP There he was, and there was
the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded STOP “Take off his head!” cried the audience STOP “An enemy to the Republic!”

The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the
prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in
England STOP Undoubtedly it was STOP Was he not an emigrant then STOP What did he call himself STOP Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law STOP Why not STOP the President desired to know STOP Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful
to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left
his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present
acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in
England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France STOP What proof had he of this STOP He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and
Alexandre Manette STOP But he had married in England STOP the President reminded him STOP True, but not an English woman STOP A citizeness of France STOP Yes STOP By birth STOP Her name and family STOP “Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who
sits there.”

This answer had a happy effect upon the audience STOP Cries in exaltation
of the well-known good physician rent the hall STOP So capriciously were
the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as
if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him STOP On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot
according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions STOP The same cautious
counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every
inch of his road STOP The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not
sooner STOP He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means
of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England,
he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature STOP He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of
a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his
absence STOP He had come back, to save a citizen's life, and to bear his
testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth STOP Was that criminal
in the eyes of the Republic STOP The populace cried enthusiastically, “No!” and the President rang his
bell to quiet them STOP Which it did not, for they continued to cry “No!”
 until they left off, of their own will STOP The President required the name of that citizen STOP The accused explained
that the citizen was his first witness STOP He also referred with confidence
to the citizen's letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier,
but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before
the President STOP The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that
it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced
and read STOP Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so STOP Citizen
Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the
pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of
enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly
overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out
of the Tribunal's patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he
had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury's
declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was
answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde,
called Darnay STOP Doctor Manette was next questioned STOP His high personal popularity,
and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he
proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his
release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in
England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in
their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat
government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as
the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these
circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the
straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the
populace became one STOP At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur
Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,
had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his
account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that
they were ready with their votes if the President were content to
receive them STOP At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace
set up a shout of applause STOP All the voices were in the prisoner's
favour, and the President declared him free STOP Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace
sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards
generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against
their swollen account of cruel rage STOP No man can decide now to which of
these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,
to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating STOP No sooner
was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood
at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the
prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after
his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from
exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same
people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with
the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the
streets STOP His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,
rescued him from these caresses for the moment STOP Five were to be tried
together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not
assisted it by word or deed STOP So quick was the Tribunal to compensate
itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to
him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four
hours STOP The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign
of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, “Long live the
Republic!”

The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,
for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great
crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in
Court--except two, for which he looked in vain STOP On his coming out, the
concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by
turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of
which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the
shore STOP They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had
taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages STOP Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they
had bound a pike with a red cap on its top STOP In this car of triumph, not
even the Doctor's entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home
on men's shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him,
and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that
he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he
was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine STOP In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing
him out, they carried him on STOP Reddening the snowy streets with the
prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as
they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried
him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived STOP Her father
had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his
feet, she dropped insensible in his arms STOP As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his
face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come
together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing STOP Instantly, all the
rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole STOP Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the
crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and
overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river's bank,
and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled
them away STOP After grasping the Doctor's hand, as he stood victorious and proud
before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in
breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;
after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round
his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who
lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their
rooms STOP “Lucie STOP My own STOP I am safe.”

“O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have
prayed to Him.”

They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts STOP When she was again in
his arms, he said to her:

“And now speak to your father, dearest STOP No other man in all this France
could have done what he has done for me.”

She laid her head upon her father's breast, as she had laid his poor
head on her own breast, long, long ago STOP He was happy in the return he
had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his
strength STOP “You must not be weak, my darling,” he remonstrated; “don't
tremble so STOP I have saved him.”




VII STOP A Knock at the Door


“I have saved him.” It was not another of the dreams in which he had
often come back; he was really here STOP And yet his wife trembled, and a
vague but heavy fear was upon her STOP All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately
revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on
vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that
many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to
her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her
heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be STOP The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now
the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets STOP Her mind pursued
them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to
his real presence and trembled more STOP Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this
woman's weakness, which was wonderful to see STOP No garret, no shoemaking,
no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now STOP He had accomplished the task
he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles STOP Let
them all lean upon him STOP Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was
the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but
because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,
had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards
the living of the poorer prisoners STOP Partly on this account, and
partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and
citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them
occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by
Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every
night STOP It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every
house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground STOP Mr.
Jerry Cruncher's name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down
below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name
himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had
employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called
Darnay STOP In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed STOP In the Doctor's little household, as
in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small
shops STOP To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as
possible for talk and envy, was the general desire STOP For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the
office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the
basket STOP Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home
such purchases as were needful STOP Although Miss Pross, through her long
association with a French family, might have known as much of their
language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that
direction; consequently she knew no more of that “nonsense” (as she was
pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did STOP So her manner of marketing
was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any
introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be
the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold
of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded STOP She always
made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,
one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be STOP “Now, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;
“if you are ready, I am.”

Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service STOP He had worn
all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down STOP “There's all manner of things wanted,” said Miss Pross, “and we shall
have a precious time of it STOP We want wine, among the rest STOP Nice toasts
these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.”

“It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,”
 retorted Jerry, “whether they drink your health or the Old Un's.”

“Who's he?” said Miss Pross STOP Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning “Old
Nick's.”

“Ha!” said Miss Pross, “it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the
meaning of these creatures STOP They have but one, and it's Midnight Murder,
and Mischief.”

“Hush, dear STOP Pray, pray, be cautious!” cried Lucie STOP “Yes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious,” said Miss Pross; “but I may say
among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey
smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the
streets STOP Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back STOP Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your
pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again STOP May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?”

“I think you may take that liberty,” the Doctor answered, smiling STOP “For gracious sake, don't talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of
that,” said Miss Pross STOP “Hush, dear STOP Again?” Lucie remonstrated STOP “Well, my sweet,” said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, “the
short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious
Majesty King George the Third;” Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; “and
as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish
tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!”

Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words
after Miss Pross, like somebody at church STOP “I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you
had never taken that cold in your voice,” said Miss Pross, approvingly STOP “But the question, Doctor Manette STOP Is there”--it was the good creature's
way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety
with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--“is there any
prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?”

“I fear not yet STOP It would be dangerous for Charles yet.”

“Heigh-ho-hum!” said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she
glanced at her darling's golden hair in the light of the fire, “then we
must have patience and wait: that's all STOP We must hold up our heads and
fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say STOP Now, Mr STOP Cruncher!--Don't
you move, Ladybird!”

They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the
child, by a bright fire STOP Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the
Banking House STOP Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in
a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed STOP Little Lucie
sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,
in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of
a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out
a captive who had once done the Fairy a service STOP All was subdued and
quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been STOP “What is that?” she cried, all at once STOP “My dear!” said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand
on hers, “command yourself STOP What a disordered state you are in STOP The
least thing--nothing--startles you STOP _You_, your father's daughter!”

“I thought, my father,” said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face
and in a faltering voice, “that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.”

“My love, the staircase is as still as Death.”

As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door STOP “Oh father, father STOP What can this be STOP Hide Charles STOP Save him!”

“My child,” said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her
shoulder, “I _have_ saved him STOP What weakness is this, my dear STOP Let me go
to the door.”

He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms,
and opened it STOP A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough
men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room STOP “The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay,” said the first STOP “Who seeks him?” answered Darnay STOP “I seek him STOP We seek him STOP I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the
Tribunal to-day STOP You are again the prisoner of the Republic.”

The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging
to him STOP “Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?”

“It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will
know to-morrow STOP You are summoned for to-morrow.”

Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he
stood with the lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it,
moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting
the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red
woollen shirt, said:

“You know him, you have said STOP Do you know me?”

“Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.”

“We all know you, Citizen Doctor,” said the other three STOP He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice,
after a pause:

“Will you answer his question to me then STOP How does this happen?”

“Citizen Doctor,” said the first, reluctantly, “he has been denounced to
the Section of Saint Antoine STOP This citizen,” pointing out the second who
had entered, “is from Saint Antoine.”

The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:

“He is accused by Saint Antoine.”

“Of what?” asked the Doctor STOP “Citizen Doctor,” said the first, with his former reluctance, “ask no
more STOP If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as
a good patriot will be happy to make them STOP The Republic goes before all STOP The People is supreme STOP Evremonde, we are pressed.”

“One word,” the Doctor entreated STOP “Will you tell me who denounced him?”

“It is against rule,” answered the first; “but you can ask Him of Saint
Antoine here.”

The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man STOP Who moved uneasily on his
feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:

“Well STOP Truly it is against rule STOP But he is denounced--and gravely--by
the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge STOP And by one other.”

“What other?”

“Do _you_ ask, Citizen Doctor?”

“Yes.”

“Then,” said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, “you will be
answered to-morrow STOP Now, I am dumb!”




VIII STOP A Hand at Cards


Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her
way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the
Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases
she had to make STOP Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side STOP They
both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they
passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and
turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers STOP It
was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing
lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were
stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the
Republic STOP Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got
undeserved promotion in it STOP Better for him that his beard had never
grown, for the National Razor shaved him close STOP Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil
for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted STOP After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,
once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather
took her fancy STOP It had a quieter look than any other place of the same
description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was
not so red as the rest STOP Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her
opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,
attended by her cavalier STOP Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,
playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,
bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of
the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be
resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the
popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude,
like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached
the counter, and showed what they wanted STOP As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a
corner, and rose to depart STOP In going, he had to face Miss Pross STOP No
sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped
her hands STOP In a moment, the whole company were on their feet STOP That somebody was
assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the
likeliest occurrence STOP Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only
saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all
the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman,
evidently English STOP What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very
voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss
Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears STOP But, they had no
ears for anything in their surprise STOP For, it must be recorded, that
not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,
Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual
account--was in a state of the greatest wonder STOP “What is the matter?” said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream;
speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in
English STOP “Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!” cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again STOP “After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time,
do I find you here!”

“Don't call me Solomon STOP Do you want to be the death of me?” asked the
man, in a furtive, frightened way STOP “Brother, brother!” cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears STOP “Have I ever
been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?”

“Then hold your meddlesome tongue,” said Solomon, “and come out, if you
want to speak to me STOP Pay for your wine, and come out STOP Who's this man?”

Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
affectionate brother, said through her tears, “Mr STOP Cruncher.”

“Let him come out too,” said Solomon STOP “Does he think me a ghost?”

Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks STOP He said not a
word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule
through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine STOP As she did
so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus
of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French
language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and
pursuits STOP “Now,” said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, “what do you
want?”

“How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away
from!” cried Miss Pross, “to give me such a greeting, and show me no
affection.”

“There STOP Confound it STOP There,” said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's
lips with his own STOP “Now are you content?”

Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence STOP “If you expect me to be surprised,” said her brother Solomon, “I am not
surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here STOP If
you really don't want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you
do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine STOP I am busy STOP I
am an official.”

“My English brother Solomon,” mourned Miss Pross, casting up her
tear-fraught eyes, “that had the makings in him of one of the best and
greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and
such foreigners STOP I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in
his--”

“I said so!” cried her brother, interrupting STOP “I knew it STOP You want to be
the death of me STOP I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister STOP Just
as I am getting on!”

“The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!” cried Miss Pross STOP “Far
rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever
loved you truly, and ever shall STOP Say but one affectionate word to me,
and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will
detain you no longer.”

Good Miss Pross STOP As if the estrangement between them had come of any
culpability of hers STOP As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years
ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent
her money and left her STOP He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging
condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative
merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case,
all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder,
hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular
question:

“I say STOP Might I ask the favour STOP As to whether your name is John Solomon,
or Solomon John?”

The official turned towards him with sudden distrust STOP He had not
previously uttered a word STOP “Come!” said Mr. Cruncher STOP “Speak out, you know.” (Which, by the way,
was more than he could do himself. STOP “John Solomon, or Solomon John STOP She
calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister STOP And _I_ know
you're John, you know STOP Which of the two goes first STOP And regarding that
name of Pross, likewise STOP That warn't your name over the water.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name
was, over the water.”

“No?”

“No STOP But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables.”

“Indeed?”

“Yes STOP T'other one's was one syllable STOP I know you STOP You was a spy--witness
at the Bailey STOP What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to
yourself, was you called at that time?”

“Barsad,” said another voice, striking in STOP “That's the name for a thousand pound!” cried Jerry STOP The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton STOP He had his hands behind
him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher's
elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself STOP “Don't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross STOP I arrived at Mr. Lorry's, to his
surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself
elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present
myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother STOP I wish you had a
better employed brother than Mr. Barsad STOP I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad
was not a Sheep of the Prisons.”

Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers STOP The spy,
who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--

“I'll tell you,” said Sydney STOP “I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out
of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls,
an hour or more ago STOP You have a face to be remembered, and I remember
faces well STOP Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having
a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with
the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your
direction STOP I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and
sat near you STOP I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved
conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the
nature of your calling STOP And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed
to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.”

“What purpose?” the spy asked STOP “It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the
street STOP Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your
company--at the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance?”

“Under a threat?”

“Oh STOP Did I say that?”

“Then, why should I go there?”

“Really, Mr. Barsad, I can't say, if you can't.”

“Do you mean that you won't say, sir?” the spy irresolutely asked STOP “You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad STOP I won't.”

Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his
quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,
and with such a man as he had to do with STOP His practised eye saw it, and
made the most of it STOP “Now, I told you so,” said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his
sister; “if any trouble comes of this, it's your doing.”

“Come, come, Mr. Barsad!” exclaimed Sydney STOP “Don't be ungrateful STOP But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so
pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual
satisfaction STOP Do you go with me to the Bank?”

“I'll hear what you have got to say STOP Yes, I'll go with you.”

“I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her
own street STOP Let me take your arm, Miss Pross STOP This is not a good city,
at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort
knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry's with us STOP Are we
ready STOP Come then!”

Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life
remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney's arm and looked up
in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced
purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only
contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man STOP She was
too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved
her affection, and with Sydney's friendly reassurances, adequately to
heed what she observed STOP They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr.
Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk STOP John Barsad, or Solomon
Pross, walked at his side STOP Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery
little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the
picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked
into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years
ago STOP He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with
which he saw a stranger STOP “Miss Pross's brother, sir,” said Sydney STOP “Mr STOP Barsad.”

“Barsad?” repeated the old gentleman, “Barsad STOP I have an association
with the name--and with the face.”

“I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,” observed Carton,
coolly STOP “Pray sit down.”

As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,
by saying to him with a frown, “Witness at that trial.” Mr. Lorry
immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised
look of abhorrence STOP “Mr STOP Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate
brother you have heard of,” said Sydney, “and has acknowledged the
relationship STOP I pass to worse news STOP Darnay has been arrested again.”

Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, “What do you
tell me STOP I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about
to return to him!”

“Arrested for all that STOP When was it done, Mr. Barsad?”

“Just now, if at all.”

“Mr STOP Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,” said Sydney, “and I
have it from Mr. Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep
over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place STOP He left the
messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter STOP There is no
earthly doubt that he is retaken.”

Mr. Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss
of time to dwell upon the point STOP Confused, but sensible that something
might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was
silently attentive STOP “Now, I trust,” said Sydney to him, “that the name and influence of
Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he
would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr STOP Barsad?--”

“Yes; I believe so.”

“--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day STOP But it may not be so STOP I own
to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's not having had the
power to prevent this arrest.”

“He may not have known of it beforehand,” said Mr. Lorry STOP “But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how
identified he is with his son-in-law.”

“That's true,” Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his
chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton STOP “In short,” said Sydney, “this is a desperate time, when desperate games
are played for desperate stakes STOP Let the Doctor play the winning game; I
will play the losing one STOP No man's life here is worth purchase STOP Any one
carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow STOP Now, the
stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend
in the Conciergerie STOP And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.
Barsad.”

“You need have good cards, sir,” said the spy STOP “I'll run them over STOP I'll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a
brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy.”

It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another
glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away STOP “Mr STOP Barsad,” he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking
over a hand at cards: “Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican
committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,
so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman
is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a
Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name STOP That's a very good card STOP Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican
French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic
English government, the enemy of France and freedom STOP That's an excellent
card STOP Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.
Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the
spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,
the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so
difficult to find STOP That's a card not to be beaten STOP Have you followed my
hand, Mr. Barsad?”

“Not to understand your play,” returned the spy, somewhat uneasily STOP “I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section
Committee STOP Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have STOP Don't
hurry.”

He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and
drank it off STOP He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself
into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him STOP Seeing it, he
poured out and drank another glassful STOP “Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad STOP Take time.”

It was a poorer hand than he suspected STOP Mr. Barsad saw losing cards
in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of STOP Thrown out of his honourable
employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing
there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for
vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in
France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen
there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives STOP He
knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint
Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received from the watchful police
such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment,
release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to
familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame
Defarge, and had broken down with them signally STOP He always remembered
with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he
talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved STOP He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over
again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the
guillotine then surely swallowed up STOP He knew, as every one employed as
he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that
he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of
his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning
terror, a word might bring it down upon him STOP Once denounced, and on such
grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw
that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many
proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash
his last chance of life STOP Besides that all secret men are men soon
terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify
the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over STOP “You scarcely seem to like your hand,” said Sydney, with the greatest
composure STOP “Do you play?”

“I think, sir,” said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr.
Lorry, “I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to
put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can
under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace
of which he has spoken STOP I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is
considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by
somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean
himself as to make himself one?”

“I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,” said Carton, taking the answer on himself,
and looking at his watch, “without any scruple, in a very few minutes.”

“I should have hoped, gentlemen both,” said the spy, always striving to
hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, “that your respect for my sister--”

“I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
relieving her of her brother,” said Sydney Carton STOP “You think not, sir?”

“I have thoroughly made up my mind about it.”

The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his
ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour,
received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a
mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and
failed him STOP While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air
of contemplating cards:

“And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I
have another good card here, not yet enumerated STOP That friend and
fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;
who was he?”

“French STOP You don't know him,” said the spy, quickly STOP “French, eh?” repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him
at all, though he echoed his word STOP “Well; he may be.”

“Is, I assure you,” said the spy; “though it's not important.”

“Though it's not important,” repeated Carton, in the same mechanical
way--“though it's not important--No, it's not important STOP No STOP Yet I know
the face.”

“I think not STOP I am sure not STOP It can't be,” said the spy STOP “It-can't-be,” muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his
glass (which fortunately was a small one) again STOP “Can't-be STOP Spoke good
French STOP Yet like a foreigner, I thought?”

“Provincial,” said the spy STOP “No STOP Foreign!” cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a
light broke clearly on his mind STOP “Cly STOP Disguised, but the same man STOP We
had that man before us at the Old Bailey.”

“Now, there you are hasty, sir,” said Barsad, with a smile that gave his
aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; “there you really give
me an advantage over you STOP Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this
distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years STOP I
attended him in his last illness STOP He was buried in London, at the church
of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields STOP His unpopularity with the blackguard
multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped
to lay him in his coffin.”

Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable
goblin shadow on the wall STOP Tracing it to its source, he discovered it
to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the
risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher's head STOP “Let us be reasonable,” said the spy, “and let us be fair STOP To show you
how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will
lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial, which I happened to have
carried in my pocket-book,” with a hurried hand he produced and opened
it, “ever since STOP There it is STOP Oh, look at it, look at it STOP You may take
it in your hand; it's no forgery.”

Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and
Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward STOP His hair could not have been more
violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the
crumpled horn in the house that Jack built STOP Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on
the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff STOP “That there Roger Cly, master,” said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and
iron-bound visage STOP “So _you_ put him in his coffin?”

“I did.”

“Who took him out of it?”

Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, “What do you mean?”

“I mean,” said Mr. Cruncher, “that he warn't never in it STOP No STOP Not he STOP I'll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.”

The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in
unspeakable astonishment at Jerry STOP “I tell you,” said Jerry, “that you buried paving-stones and earth in
that there coffin STOP Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly STOP It was a
take in STOP Me and two more knows it.”

“How do you know it?”

“What's that to you STOP Ecod!” growled Mr. Cruncher, “it's you I have got a
old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen STOP I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.”

Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and
explain himself STOP “At another time, sir,” he returned, evasively, “the present time is
ill-conwenient for explainin' STOP What I stand to, is, that he knows well
wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin STOP Let him say he was,
in so much as a word of one syllable, and I'll either catch hold of his
throat and choke him for half a guinea;” Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as
quite a liberal offer; “or I'll out and announce him.”

“Humph STOP I see one thing,” said Carton STOP “I hold another card, Mr. Barsad STOP Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for
you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another
aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has
the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again STOP A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic STOP A strong
card--a certain Guillotine card STOP Do you play?”

“No!” returned the spy STOP “I throw up STOP I confess that we were so unpopular
with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk
of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that
he never would have got away at all but for that sham STOP Though how this
man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.”

“Never you trouble your head about this man,” retorted the contentious
Mr. Cruncher; “you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to
that gentleman STOP And look here STOP Once more!”--Mr. Cruncher could not
be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his
liberality--“I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea.”

The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said,
with more decision, “It has come to a point STOP I go on duty soon, and
can't overstay my time STOP You told me you had a proposal; what is it STOP Now, it is of no use asking too much of me STOP Ask me to do anything in my
office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my
life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent STOP In short,
I should make that choice STOP You talk of desperation STOP We are all desperate
here STOP Remember STOP I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my
way through stone walls, and so can others STOP Now, what do you want with
me?”

“Not very much STOP You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?”

“I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,”
 said the spy, firmly STOP “Why need you tell me what I have not asked STOP You are a turnkey at the
Conciergerie?”

“I am sometimes.”

“You can be when you choose?”

“I can pass in and out when I choose.”

Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out
upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped STOP It being all spent, he
said, rising:

“So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that
the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me STOP Come
into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.”




IX STOP The Game Made


While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining
dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked
at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust STOP That honest tradesman's
manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the
leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs,
and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very
questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught
his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the
hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an
infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character STOP “Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry STOP “Come here.”

Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance
of him STOP “What have you been, besides a messenger?”

After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron,
Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, “Agicultooral
character.”

“My mind misgives me much,” said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger
at him, “that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's
as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous
description STOP If you have, don't expect me to befriend you when you
get back to England STOP If you have, don't expect me to keep your secret STOP Tellson's shall not be imposed upon.”

“I hope, sir,” pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, “that a gentleman like
yourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it,
would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don't say it
is, but even if it wos STOP And which it is to be took into account that if
it wos, it wouldn't, even then, be all o' one side STOP There'd be two sides
to it STOP There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking
up their guineas where a honest tradesman don't pick up his
fardens--fardens STOP no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens STOP no, nor
yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson's, and a cocking
their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going
out to their own carriages--ah STOP equally like smoke, if not more so STOP Well, that 'ud be imposing, too, on Tellson's STOP For you cannot sarse the
goose and not the gander STOP And here's Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos
in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given,
a floppin' again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark
ruinating STOP Whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flop--catch 'em at
it STOP Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,
and how can you rightly have one without t'other STOP Then, wot with
undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot
with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn't get
much by it, even if it wos so STOP And wot little a man did get, would never
prosper with him, Mr. Lorry STOP He'd never have no good of it; he'd want
all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being
once in--even if it wos so.”

“Ugh!” cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, “I am shocked at
the sight of you.”

“Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,” pursued Mr. Cruncher,
“even if it wos so, which I don't say it is--”

“Don't prevaricate,” said Mr. Lorry STOP “No, I will _not_, sir,” returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were
further from his thoughts or practice--“which I don't say it is--wot I
would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this STOP Upon that there stool, at
that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to
be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till
your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes STOP If it
wos so, which I still don't say it is (for I will not prewaricate to
you, sir), let that there boy keep his father's place, and take care of
his mother; don't blow upon that boy's father--do not do it, sir--and
let that father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin', and make amends
for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin' of 'em in with
a will, and with conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of 'em safe STOP That, Mr. Lorry,” said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his
arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his
discourse, “is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir STOP A man don't
see all this here a goin' on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects
without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down
to porterage and hardly that, without havin' his serious thoughts of
things STOP And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin' of you
fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good
cause when I might have kep' it back.”

“That at least is true,” said Mr. Lorry STOP “Say no more now STOP It may be
that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in
action--not in words STOP I want no more words.”

Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy
returned from the dark room STOP “Adieu, Mr. Barsad,” said the former; “our
arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.”

He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry STOP When they
were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done STOP “Not much STOP If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access
to him, once.”

Mr. Lorry's countenance fell STOP “It is all I could do,” said Carton STOP “To propose too much, would be
to put this man's head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing
worse could happen to him if he were denounced STOP It was obviously the
weakness of the position STOP There is no help for it.”

“But access to him,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it should go ill before the
Tribunal, will not save him.”

“I never said it would.”

Mr. Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his
darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually
weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late,
and his tears fell STOP “You are a good man and a true friend,” said Carton, in an altered
voice STOP “Forgive me if I notice that you are affected STOP I could not see my
father weep, and sit by, careless STOP And I could not respect your
sorrow more, if you were my father STOP You are free from that misfortune,
however.”

Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there
was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,
that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly
unprepared for STOP He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it STOP “To return to poor Darnay,” said Carton STOP “Don't tell Her of this
interview, or this arrangement STOP It would not enable Her to go to see
him STOP She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey
to him the means of anticipating the sentence.”

Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to
see if it were in his mind STOP It seemed to be; he returned the look, and
evidently understood it STOP “She might think a thousand things,” Carton said, “and any of them would
only add to her trouble STOP Don't speak of me to her STOP As I said to you when
I first came, I had better not see her STOP I can put my hand out, to do any
little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that STOP You are going to her, I hope STOP She must be very desolate to-night.”

“I am going now, directly.”

“I am glad of that STOP She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance
on you STOP How does she look?”

“Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.”

“Ah!”

It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob STOP It
attracted Mr. Lorry's eyes to Carton's face, which was turned to the
fire STOP A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),
passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a
wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little
flaming logs, which was tumbling forward STOP He wore the white riding-coat
and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their
light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,
all untrimmed, hanging loose about him STOP His indifference to fire was
sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;
his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had
broken under the weight of his foot STOP “I forgot it,” he said STOP Mr. Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face STOP Taking note of the
wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having
the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly
reminded of that expression STOP “And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?” said Carton, turning
to him STOP “Yes STOP As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so
unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here STOP I hoped to
have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris STOP I have
my Leave to Pass STOP I was ready to go.”

They were both silent STOP “Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?” said Carton, wistfully STOP “I am in my seventy-eighth year.”

“You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;
trusted, respected, and looked up to?”

“I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man STOP Indeed, I
may say that I was a man of business when a boy.”

“See what a place you fill at seventy-eight STOP How many people will miss
you when you leave it empty!”

“A solitary old bachelor,” answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head STOP “There
is nobody to weep for me.”

“How can you say that STOP Wouldn't She weep for you STOP Wouldn't her child?”

“Yes, yes, thank God STOP I didn't quite mean what I said.”

“It _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?”

“Surely, surely.”

“If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,
'I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or
respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no
regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by! STOP your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they
not?”

“You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.”

Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a
few moments, said:

“I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off STOP Do the
days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?”

Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:

“Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no STOP For, as I draw
closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and
nearer to the beginning STOP It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and
preparings of the way STOP My heart is touched now, by many remembrances
that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old STOP ),
and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not
so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.”

“I understand the feeling!” exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush STOP “And
you are the better for it?”

“I hope so.”

Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with
his outer coat; “But you,” said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, “you
are young.”

“Yes,” said Carton STOP “I am not old, but my young way was never the way to
age STOP Enough of me.”

“And of me, I am sure,” said Mr. Lorry STOP “Are you going out?”

“I'll walk with you to her gate STOP You know my vagabond and restless
habits STOP If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be
uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning STOP You go to the Court to-morrow?”

“Yes, unhappily.”

“I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd STOP My Spy will find a
place for me STOP Take my arm, sir.”

Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets STOP A
few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination STOP Carton left him
there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate
again when it was shut, and touched it STOP He had heard of her going to
the prison every day STOP “She came out here,” he said, looking about him,
“turned this way, must have trod on these stones often STOP Let me follow in
her steps.”

It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force,
where she had stood hundreds of times STOP A little wood-sawyer, having
closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door STOP “Good night, citizen,” said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the
man eyed him inquisitively STOP “Good night, citizen.”

“How goes the Republic?”

“You mean the Guillotine STOP Not ill. Sixty-three to-day STOP We shall mount
to a hundred soon STOP Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being
exhausted STOP Ha, ha, ha STOP He is so droll, that Samson STOP Such a Barber!”

“Do you often go to see him--”

“Shave STOP Always STOP Every day STOP What a barber STOP You have seen him at work?”

“Never.”

“Go and see him when he has a good batch STOP Figure this to yourself,
citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes STOP Less
than two pipes STOP Word of honour!”

As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain
how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire
to strike the life out of him, that he turned away STOP “But you are not English,” said the wood-sawyer, “though you wear
English dress?”

“Yes,” said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder STOP “You speak like a Frenchman.”

“I am an old student here.”

“Aha, a perfect Frenchman STOP Good night, Englishman.”

“Good night, citizen.”

“But go and see that droll dog,” the little man persisted, calling after
him STOP “And take a pipe with you!”

Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of
the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap
of paper STOP Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered
the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,
for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of
terror--he stopped at a chemist's shop, which the owner was closing with
his own hands STOP A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill
thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man STOP Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his
counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him STOP “Whew!” the chemist
whistled softly, as he read it STOP “Hi STOP hi STOP hi!”

Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:

“For you, citizen?”

“For me.”

“You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen STOP You know the
consequences of mixing them?”

“Perfectly.”

Certain small packets were made and given to him STOP He put them, one by
one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them,
and deliberately left the shop STOP “There is nothing more to do,” said he,
glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow STOP I can't sleep.”

It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words
aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of
negligence than defiance STOP It was the settled manner of a tired man, who
had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into
his road and saw its end STOP Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a
youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave STOP His
mother had died, years before STOP These solemn words, which had been
read at his father's grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark
streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing
on high above him STOP “I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord:
he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.”

In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow
rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,
and for to-morrow's victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,
and still of to-morrow's and to-morrow's, the chain of association that
brought the words home, like a rusty old ship's anchor from the deep,
might have been easily found STOP He did not seek it, but repeated them and
went on STOP With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors
surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers
were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length
of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and
profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon
the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets
along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and
material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among
the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn
interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its
short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for
the lighter streets STOP Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be
suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy
shoes, and trudged STOP But, the theatres were all well filled, and the
people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home STOP At
one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking
for a way across the street through the mud STOP He carried the child over,
and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss STOP “I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me, shall never die.”

Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words
were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air STOP Perfectly calm
and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he
heard them always STOP The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the
water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the
picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light
of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the
sky STOP Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died,
and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to
Death's dominion STOP But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden
of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays STOP And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light
appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river
sparkled under it STOP The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial
friend, in the morning stillness STOP He walked by the stream, far from the
houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the
bank STOP When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little
longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the
stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--“Like me.”

A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then
glided into his view, floated by him, and died away STOP As its silent track
in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors,
ended in the words, “I am the resurrection and the life.”

Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise
where the good old man was gone STOP Sydney Carton drank nothing but a
little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh
himself, went out to the place of trial STOP The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell
away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd STOP Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there STOP She was there,
sitting beside her father STOP When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so
sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying
tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy
blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart STOP If
there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney
Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly STOP Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,
ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing STOP There could have
been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not
first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the
Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds STOP Every eye was turned to the jury STOP The same determined patriots and good
republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day
after STOP Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and
his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance
gave great satisfaction to the spectators STOP A life-thirsting,
cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St.
Antoine STOP The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer STOP Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor STOP No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day STOP A fell, uncompromising,
murderous business-meaning there STOP Every eye then sought some other eye
in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one
another, before bending forward with a strained attention STOP Charles Evremonde, called Darnay STOP Released yesterday STOP Reaccused and
retaken yesterday STOP Indictment delivered to him last night STOP Suspected and
Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants,
one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished
privileges to the infamous oppression of the people STOP Charles Evremonde,
called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law STOP To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor STOP The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly STOP “Openly, President.”

“By whom?”

“Three voices STOP Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.”

“Good.”

“Therese Defarge, his wife.”

“Good.”

“Alexandre Manette, physician.”

A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor
Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated STOP “President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and
a fraud STOP You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter STOP My
daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life STOP Who
and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband
of my child!”

“Citizen Manette, be tranquil STOP To fail in submission to the authority of
the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law STOP As to what is dearer
to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the
Republic.”

Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke STOP The President rang his bell, and
with warmth resumed STOP “If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her STOP Listen to what is
to follow STOP In the meanwhile, be silent!”

Frantic acclamations were again raised STOP Doctor Manette sat down, with
his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew
closer to him STOP The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together,
and restored the usual hand to his mouth STOP Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his
being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of
his having been a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the release,
and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him STOP This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work STOP “You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?”

“I believe so.”

Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: “You were one of the
best patriots there STOP Why not say so STOP You were a cannonier that day
there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when
it fell STOP Patriots, I speak the truth!”

It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience,
thus assisted the proceedings STOP The President rang his bell; but, The
Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, “I defy that bell!”
 wherein she was likewise much commended STOP “Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,
citizen.”

“I knew,” said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the
bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him;
“I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell
known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower STOP I knew it from himself STOP He
knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower,
when he made shoes under my care STOP As I serve my gun that day, I resolve,
when the place shall fall, to examine that cell STOP It falls STOP I mount to
the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a
gaoler STOP I examine it, very closely STOP In a hole in the chimney, where a
stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper STOP This is
that written paper STOP I have made it my business to examine some specimens
of the writing of Doctor Manette STOP This is the writing of Doctor Manette STOP I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of
the President.”

“Let it be read.”

In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking
lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with
solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the
reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge
never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there
intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as
follows STOP X STOP The Substance of the Shadow


“I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and
afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful
cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767 STOP I write
it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty STOP I design to secrete it
in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a
place of concealment for it STOP Some pitying hand may find it there, when I
and my sorrows are dust STOP “These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with
difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed
with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity STOP Hope
has quite departed from my breast STOP I know from terrible warnings I have
noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I
solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right
mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the
truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they
be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat STOP “One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the
twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired
part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air,
at an hour's distance from my place of residence in the Street of the
School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very
fast STOP As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it
might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a
voice called to the driver to stop STOP “The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses,
and the same voice called to me by my name STOP I answered STOP The carriage
was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the
door and alight before I came up with it STOP “I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to
conceal themselves STOP As they stood side by side near the carriage door,
I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather
younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice,
and (as far as I could see) face too STOP “'You are Doctor Manette? STOP said one STOP “I am.”

“'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the young
physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two
has made a rising reputation in Paris? STOP “'Gentlemen,' I returned, 'I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so
graciously. STOP “'We have been to your residence,' said the first, 'and not being
so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were
probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of
overtaking you STOP Will you please to enter the carriage? STOP “The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words
were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door STOP They were armed STOP I was not STOP “'Gentlemen,' said I, 'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me
the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to
which I am summoned. STOP “The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second STOP 'Doctor,
your clients are people of condition STOP As to the nature of the case,
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
yourself better than we can describe it STOP Enough STOP Will you please to
enter the carriage? STOP “I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence STOP They both
entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps STOP The
carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed STOP “I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred STOP I have no doubt that
it is, word for word, the same STOP I describe everything exactly as it took
place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task STOP Where I make
the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my
paper in its hiding-place STOP *****

“The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and
emerged upon the country road STOP At two-thirds of a league from the
Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards
when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently
stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by
a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had
overflowed, to the door of the house STOP It was not opened immediately, in
answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck
the man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face STOP “There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention,
for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs STOP But, the
other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner
with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers STOP “From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found
locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had
relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber STOP I was
conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain,
lying on a bed STOP “The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much
past twenty STOP Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to
her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs STOP I noticed that these bonds were
all portions of a gentleman's dress STOP On one of them, which was a fringed
scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble,
and the letter E.

“I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient;
for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the
edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was
in danger of suffocation STOP My first act was to put out my hand to relieve
her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the
corner caught my sight STOP “I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her
and keep her down, and looked into her face STOP Her eyes were dilated and
wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the
words, 'My husband, my father, and my brother! STOP and then counted up to
twelve, and said, 'Hush! STOP For an instant, and no more, she would pause
to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she
would repeat the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother! STOP and
would count up to twelve, and say, 'Hush! STOP There was no variation in the
order, or the manner STOP There was no cessation, but the regular moment's
pause, in the utterance of these sounds STOP “'How long,' I asked, 'has this lasted? STOP “To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the
younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority STOP It
was the elder who replied, 'Since about this hour last night. STOP “'She has a husband, a father, and a brother? STOP “'A brother. STOP “'I do not address her brother? STOP “He answered with great contempt, 'No. STOP “'She has some recent association with the number twelve? STOP “The younger brother impatiently rejoined, 'With twelve o'clock? STOP “'See, gentlemen,' said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, 'how
useless I am, as you have brought me STOP If I had known what I was coming
to see, I could have come provided STOP As it is, time must be lost STOP There
are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place. STOP “The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, 'There is
a case of medicines here;' and brought it from a closet, and put it on
the table STOP *****

“I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my
lips STOP If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were
poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those STOP “'Do you doubt them? STOP asked the younger brother STOP “'You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,' I replied, and said no
more STOP “I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many
efforts, the dose that I desired to give STOP As I intended to repeat it
after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then
sat down by the side of the bed STOP There was a timid and suppressed woman
in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into
a corner STOP The house was damp and decayed, indifferently
furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used STOP Some thick
old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the
sound of the shrieks STOP They continued to be uttered in their regular
succession, with the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother! STOP the
counting up to twelve, and 'Hush! STOP The frenzy was so violent, that I had
not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to
them, to see that they were not painful STOP The only spark of encouragement
in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer's breast had this much
soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the
figure STOP It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more
regular STOP “For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by
the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on,
before the elder said:

“'There is another patient. STOP “I was startled, and asked, 'Is it a pressing case? STOP “'You had better see,' he carelessly answered; and took up a light STOP *****

“The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which
was a species of loft over a stable STOP There was a low plastered ceiling
to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and
there were beams across STOP Hay and straw were stored in that portion of
the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand STOP I had to
pass through that part, to get at the other STOP My memory is circumstantial
and unshaken STOP I try it with these details, and I see them all, in
this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my
captivity, as I saw them all that night STOP “On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a
handsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most STOP He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his
breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward STOP I could not see
where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see
that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point STOP “'I am a doctor, my poor fellow,' said I STOP 'Let me examine it. STOP “'I do not want it examined,' he answered; 'let it be. STOP “It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away STOP The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours
before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to
without delay STOP He was then dying fast STOP As I turned my eyes to the elder
brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was
ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all
as if he were a fellow-creature STOP “'How has this been done, monsieur? STOP said I STOP “'A crazed young common dog STOP A serf STOP Forced my brother to draw upon him,
and has fallen by my brother's sword--like a gentleman. STOP “There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this
answer STOP The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would
have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his
vermin kind STOP He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about
the boy, or about his fate STOP “The boy's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now
slowly moved to me STOP “'Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are
proud too, sometimes STOP They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but
we have a little pride left, sometimes STOP She--have you seen her, Doctor? STOP “The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the
distance STOP He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence STOP “I said, 'I have seen her. STOP “'She is my sister, Doctor STOP They have had their shameful rights, these
Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we
have had good girls among us STOP I know it, and have heard my father say
so STOP She was a good girl STOP She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a
tenant of his STOP We were all tenants of his--that man's who stands there STOP The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race. STOP “It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis STOP “'We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs
are by those superior Beings--taxed by him without mercy, obliged to
work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged
to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden
for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and
plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we
ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his
people should not see it and take it from us--I say, we were so robbed,
and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a
dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should
most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable
race die out! STOP “I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth
like a fire STOP I had supposed that it must be latent in the people
somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the
dying boy STOP “'Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married STOP He was ailing at that time,
poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort
him in our cottage--our dog-hut, as that man would call it STOP She had not
been married many weeks, when that man's brother saw her and admired
her, and asked that man to lend her to him--for what are husbands among
us STOP He was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and
hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine STOP What did the two
then, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her
willing? STOP “The boy's eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the
looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true STOP The two
opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this
Bastille; the gentleman's, all negligent indifference; the peasant's, all
trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge STOP “'You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us STOP They so harnessed him and
drove him STOP You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their
grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep
may not be disturbed STOP They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at
night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day STOP But he was
not persuaded STOP No STOP Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he
could find food--he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the
bell, and died on her bosom. STOP “Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to
tell all his wrong STOP He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as
he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his
wound STOP “'Then, with that man's permission and even with his aid, his
brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his
brother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if
it is now--his brother took her away--for his pleasure and diversion,
for a little while STOP I saw her pass me on the road STOP When I took the
tidings home, our father's heart burst; he never spoke one of the words
that filled it STOP I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place
beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be
_his_ vassal STOP Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed
in--a common dog, but sword in hand.--Where is the loft window STOP It was
somewhere here? STOP “The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around
him STOP I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled
over the floor, as if there had been a struggle STOP “'She heard me, and ran in STOP I told her not to come near us till he was
dead STOP He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck
at me with a whip STOP But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to
make him draw STOP Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword
that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself--thrust
at me with all his skill for his life. STOP “My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of
a broken sword, lying among the hay STOP That weapon was a gentleman's STOP In
another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier's STOP “'Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up STOP Where is he? STOP “'He is not here,' I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he
referred to the brother STOP “'He STOP Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me STOP Where is the
man who was here STOP Turn my face to him. STOP “I did so, raising the boy's head against my knee STOP But, invested for the
moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging
me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him STOP “'Marquis,' said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and
his right hand raised, 'in the days when all these things are to be
answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to
answer for them STOP I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that
I do it STOP In the days when all these things are to be answered for,
I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them
separately STOP I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do
it. STOP “Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his
forefinger drew a cross in the air STOP He stood for an instant with the
finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him
down dead STOP *****

“When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving
in precisely the same order of continuity STOP I knew that this might last
for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the
grave STOP “I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of
the bed until the night was far advanced STOP She never abated the piercing
quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order
of her words STOP They were always 'My husband, my father, and my brother STOP One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve STOP Hush! STOP “This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her STOP I had
come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to
falter STOP I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and
by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead STOP “It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and
fearful storm STOP I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to
compose her figure and the dress she had torn STOP It was then that I knew
her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being
a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had
had of her STOP “'Is she dead? STOP asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the
elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse STOP “'Not dead,' said I; 'but like to die. STOP “'What strength there is in these common bodies! STOP he said, looking down
at her with some curiosity STOP “'There is prodigious strength,' I answered him, 'in sorrow and
despair. STOP “He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them STOP He moved a
chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a
subdued voice,

“'Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I
recommended that your aid should be invited STOP Your reputation is high,
and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful
of your interest STOP The things that you see here, are things to be seen,
and not spoken of. STOP “I listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering STOP “'Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor? STOP “'Monsieur,' said I, 'in my profession, the communications of patients
are always received in confidence. STOP I was guarded in my answer, for I
was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen STOP “Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the
pulse and the heart STOP There was life, and no more STOP Looking round as I
resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me STOP *****

“I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so
fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total
darkness, that I must abridge this narrative STOP There is no confusion or
failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that
was ever spoken between me and those brothers STOP “She lingered for a week STOP Towards the last, I could understand some few
syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips STOP She
asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her STOP It
was in vain that I asked her for her family name STOP She faintly shook her
head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done STOP “I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the
brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day STOP Until
then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the
woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind
the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there STOP But when it came to
that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as
if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too STOP “I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brother's (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that
peasant a boy STOP The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
to the family, and was ridiculous STOP As often as I caught the younger
brother's eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply,
for knowing what I knew from the boy STOP He was smoother and more polite to
me than the elder; but I saw this STOP I also saw that I was an incumbrance
in the mind of the elder, too STOP “My patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch,
answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her STOP I was alone
with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and
all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended STOP “The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride
away STOP I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with
their riding-whips, and loitering up and down STOP “'At last she is dead? STOP said the elder, when I went in STOP “'She is dead,' said I STOP “'I congratulate you, my brother,' were his words as he turned round STOP “He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking STOP He now
gave me a rouleau of gold STOP I took it from his hand, but laid it on
the table STOP I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept
nothing STOP “'Pray excuse me,' said I STOP 'Under the circumstances, no. STOP “They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to
them, and we parted without another word on either side STOP *****

“I am weary, weary, weary--worn down by misery STOP I cannot read what I
have written with this gaunt hand STOP “Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box, with my name on the outside STOP From the first, I had anxiously
considered what I ought to do STOP I decided, that day, to write privately
to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been
summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the
circumstances STOP I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities
of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be
heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind STOP I had kept the matter a
profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state
in my letter STOP I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but
I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were
compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed STOP “I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that
night STOP I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it STOP It was the last day of the year STOP The letter was lying before me just
completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me STOP *****

“I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself STOP It is
so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so
dreadful STOP “The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long
life STOP She was in great agitation STOP She presented herself to me as the
wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde STOP I connected the title by which the
boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered
on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I
had seen that nobleman very lately STOP “My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our
conversation STOP I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I
know not at what times I may be watched STOP She had in part suspected, and
in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband's
share in it, and my being resorted to STOP She did not know that the girl
was dead STOP Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her,
in secret, a woman's sympathy STOP Her hope had been to avert the wrath of
Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many STOP “She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and
her greatest desire was, to help that sister STOP I could tell her nothing
but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing STOP Her
inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope
that I could tell her the name and place of abode STOP Whereas, to this
wretched hour I am ignorant of both STOP *****

“These scraps of paper fail me STOP One was taken from me, with a warning,
yesterday STOP I must finish my record to-day STOP “She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage STOP How
could she be STOP The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence
was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her
husband too STOP When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a
pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage STOP “'For his sake, Doctor,' she said, pointing to him in tears, 'I would do
all I can to make what poor amends I can STOP He will never prosper in his
inheritance otherwise STOP I have a presentiment that if no other innocent
atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him STOP What
I have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few
jewels--I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the
compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if
the sister can be discovered. STOP “She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, 'It is for thine own dear
sake STOP Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles? STOP The child answered her
bravely, 'Yes! STOP I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and
went away caressing him STOP I never saw her more STOP “As she had mentioned her husband's name in the faith that I knew it,
I added no mention of it to my letter STOP I sealed my letter, and, not
trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day STOP “That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o'clock, a man in
a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed
my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs STOP When my servant came
into the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife, beloved of my heart STOP My fair young English wife!--we saw the man, who was supposed to be at
the gate, standing silent behind him STOP “An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said STOP It would not detain me,
he had a coach in waiting STOP “It brought me here, it brought me to my grave STOP When I was clear of the
house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and
my arms were pinioned STOP The two brothers crossed the road from a dark
corner, and identified me with a single gesture STOP The Marquis took from
his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light
of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot STOP Not a word was spoken STOP I was brought here, I was brought to my living
grave STOP “If it had pleased _God_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the
brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of
my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or
dead--I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them STOP But,
now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that
they have no part in His mercies STOP And them and their descendants, to the
last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last
night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times
when all these things shall be answered for STOP I denounce them to Heaven
and to earth.”

A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done STOP A
sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
blood STOP The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time,
and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it STOP Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show
how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured
Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their
time STOP Little need to show that this detested family name had long been
anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register STOP The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have
sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation STOP And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a
well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife STOP One
of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of
the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and
self-immolations on the people's altar STOP Therefore when the President
said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good
physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by
rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel
a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an
orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of
human sympathy STOP “Much influence around him, has that Doctor?” murmured Madame Defarge,
smiling to The Vengeance STOP “Save him now, my Doctor, save him!”

At every juryman's vote, there was a roar STOP Another and another STOP Roar and
roar STOP Unanimously voted STOP At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy
of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People STOP Back to the
Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours STOP XI STOP Dusk


The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under
the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken STOP But, she uttered no
sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was
she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment
it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock STOP The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors,
the Tribunal adjourned STOP The quick noise and movement of the court's
emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood
stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face
but love and consolation STOP “If I might touch him STOP If I might embrace him once STOP O, good citizens, if
you would have so much compassion for us!”

There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had
taken him last night, and Barsad STOP The people had all poured out to the
show in the streets STOP Barsad proposed to the rest, “Let her embrace
him then; it is but a moment.” It was silently acquiesced in, and they
passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by
leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms STOP “Farewell, dear darling of my soul STOP My parting blessing on my love STOP We
shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!”

They were her husband's words, as he held her to his bosom STOP “I can bear it, dear Charles STOP I am supported from above: don't suffer
for me STOP A parting blessing for our child.”

“I send it to her by you STOP I kiss her by you STOP I say farewell to her by
you.”

“My husband STOP No STOP A moment!” He was tearing himself apart from her STOP “We shall not be separated long STOP I feel that this will break my heart
by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God
will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.”

Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both
of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:

“No, no STOP What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel
to us STOP We know now, what a struggle you made of old STOP We know, now what
you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it STOP We
know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for
her dear sake STOP We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and
duty STOP Heaven be with you!”

Her father's only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair,
and wring them with a shriek of anguish STOP “It could not be otherwise,” said the prisoner STOP “All things have worked
together as they have fallen out STOP It was the always-vain endeavour to
discharge my poor mother's trust that first brought my fatal presence
near you STOP Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in
nature to so unhappy a beginning STOP Be comforted, and forgive me STOP Heaven
bless you!”

As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him
with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and
with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting
smile STOP As he went out at the prisoners' door, she turned, laid her head
lovingly on her father's breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his
feet STOP Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved,
Sydney Carton came and took her up STOP Only her father and Mr. Lorry were
with her STOP His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head STOP Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a
flush of pride in it STOP “Shall I take her to a coach STOP I shall never feel her weight.”

He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a
coach STOP Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat
beside the driver STOP When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not
many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of
the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up
the staircase to their rooms STOP There, he laid her down on a couch, where
her child and Miss Pross wept over her STOP “Don't recall her to herself,” he said, softly, to the latter, “she is
better so STOP Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.”

“Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!” cried little Lucie, springing up and
throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief STOP “Now that
you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to
save papa STOP O, look at her, dear Carton STOP Can you, of all the people who
love her, bear to see her so?”

He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face STOP He
put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother STOP “Before I go,” he said, and paused--“I may kiss her?”

It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face
with his lips, he murmured some words STOP The child, who was nearest to
him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a
handsome old lady, that she heard him say, “A life you love.”

When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry
and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:

“You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least
be tried STOP These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to
you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?”

“Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me STOP I had the
strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.” He returned the
answer in great trouble, and very slowly STOP “Try them again STOP The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few
and short, but try.”

“I intend to try STOP I will not rest a moment.”

“That's well STOP I have known such energy as yours do great things before
now--though never,” he added, with a smile and a sigh together, “such
great things as this STOP But try STOP Of little worth as life is when we misuse
it, it is worth that effort STOP It would cost nothing to lay down if it
were not.”

“I will go,” said Doctor Manette, “to the Prosecutor and the President
straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name STOP I will
write too, and--But stay STOP There is a Celebration in the streets, and no
one will be accessible until dark.”

“That's true STOP Well STOP It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the
forlorner for being delayed till dark STOP I should like to know how you
speed; though, mind STOP I expect nothing STOP When are you likely to have seen
these dread powers, Doctor Manette?”

“Immediately after dark, I should hope STOP Within an hour or two from
this.”

“It will be dark soon after four STOP Let us stretch the hour or two STOP If I
go to Mr. Lorry's at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from
our friend or from yourself?”

“Yes.”

“May you prosper!”

Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the
shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn STOP “I have no hope,” said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper STOP “Nor have I.”

“If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare
him--which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man's
to them!--I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the
court.”

“And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.”

Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it STOP “Don't despond,” said Carton, very gently; “don't grieve STOP I encouraged
Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be
consolatory to her STOP Otherwise, she might think 'his life was wantonly
thrown away or wasted,' and that might trouble her.”

“Yes, yes, yes,” returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, “you are right STOP But he will perish; there is no real hope.”

“Yes STOP He will perish: there is no real hope,” echoed Carton STOP And walked with a settled step, down-stairs STOP XII STOP Darkness


Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go STOP “At
Tellson's banking-house at nine,” he said, with a musing face STOP “Shall I
do well, in the mean time, to show myself STOP I think so STOP It is best that
these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound
precaution, and may be a necessary preparation STOP But care, care, care STOP Let me think it out!”

Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a
turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought
in his mind to its possible consequences STOP His first impression was
confirmed STOP “It is best,” he said, finally resolved, “that these people
should know there is such a man as I here.” And he turned his face
towards Saint Antoine STOP Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in
the Saint Antoine suburb STOP It was not difficult for one who knew the city
well, to find his house without asking any question STOP Having ascertained
its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined
at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner STOP For the
first time in many years, he had no strong drink STOP Since last night he
had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had
dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry's hearth like a man who had
done with it STOP It was as late as seven o'clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out
into the streets again STOP As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he
stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered
the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and
his wild hair STOP This done, he went on direct to Defarge's, and went in STOP There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the
restless fingers and the croaking voice STOP This man, whom he had seen upon
the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the
Defarges, man and wife STOP The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like
a regular member of the establishment STOP As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent
French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless
glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced
to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered STOP He repeated what he had already said STOP “English?” asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark
eyebrows STOP After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were
slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign
accent STOP “Yes, madame, yes STOP I am English!”

Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he
took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
meaning, he heard her say, “I swear to you, like Evremonde!”

Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening STOP “How?”

“Good evening.”

“Oh STOP Good evening, citizen,” filling his glass STOP “Ah STOP and good wine STOP I
drink to the Republic.”

Defarge went back to the counter, and said, “Certainly, a little like.”
 Madame sternly retorted, “I tell you a good deal like.” Jacques Three
pacifically remarked, “He is so much in your mind, see you, madame.”
 The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, “Yes, my faith STOP And you
are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more
to-morrow!”

Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow
forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face STOP They were all leaning
their arms on the counter close together, speaking low STOP After a silence
of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without
disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed
their conversation STOP “It is true what madame says,” observed Jacques Three STOP “Why stop STOP There
is great force in that STOP Why stop?”

“Well, well,” reasoned Defarge, “but one must stop somewhere STOP After all,
the question is still where?”

“At extermination,” said madame STOP “Magnificent!” croaked Jacques Three STOP The Vengeance, also, highly
approved STOP “Extermination is good doctrine, my wife,” said Defarge, rather
troubled; “in general, I say nothing against it STOP But this Doctor has
suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when
the paper was read.”

“I have observed his face!” repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily STOP “Yes STOP I have observed his face STOP I have observed his face to be not the
face of a true friend of the Republic STOP Let him take care of his face!”

“And you have observed, my wife,” said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner,
“the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!”

“I have observed his daughter,” repeated madame; “yes, I have observed
his daughter, more times than one STOP I have observed her to-day, and I
have observed her other days STOP I have observed her in the court, and
I have observed her in the street by the prison STOP Let me but lift my
finger--!” She seemed to raise it (the listener's eyes were always on
his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as
if the axe had dropped STOP “The citizeness is superb!” croaked the Juryman STOP “She is an Angel!” said The Vengeance, and embraced her STOP “As to thee,” pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, “if it
depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this
man even now.”

“No!” protested Defarge STOP “Not if to lift this glass would do it STOP But I
would leave the matter there STOP I say, stop there.”

“See you then, Jacques,” said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; “and see you,
too, my little Vengeance; see you both STOP Listen STOP For other crimes as
tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register,
doomed to destruction and extermination STOP Ask my husband, is that so.”

“It is so,” assented Defarge, without being asked STOP “In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds
this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the
night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot,
by the light of this lamp STOP Ask him, is that so.”

“It is so,” assented Defarge STOP “That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is
burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between
those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate STOP Ask him, is
that so.”

“It is so,” assented Defarge again STOP “I communicate to him that secret STOP I smite this bosom with these two
hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, 'Defarge, I was brought up
among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured
by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my
family STOP Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground
was my sister, that husband was my sister's husband, that unborn child
was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father,
those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things
descends to me! STOP Ask him, is that so.”

“It is so,” assented Defarge once more STOP “Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop,” returned madame; “but don't
tell me.”

Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature
of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing
her--and both highly commended it STOP Defarge, a weak minority, interposed
a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but
only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply STOP “Tell
the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!”

Customers entered, and the group was broken up STOP The English customer
paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as
a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace STOP Madame Defarge
took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road STOP The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might
be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and
deep STOP But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the
prison wall STOP At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present
himself in Mr. Lorry's room again, where he found the old gentleman
walking to and fro in restless anxiety STOP He said he had been with Lucie
until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and
keep his appointment STOP Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the
banking-house towards four o'clock STOP She had some faint hopes that his
mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight STOP He had been
more than five hours gone: where could he be STOP Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and
he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he
should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight STOP In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor STOP He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette
did not come back STOP Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and
brought none STOP Where could he be STOP They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some
weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on
the stairs STOP The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was
lost STOP Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that
time traversing the streets, was never known STOP As he stood staring at
them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything STOP “I cannot find it,” said he, “and I must have it STOP Where is it?”

His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look
straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor STOP “Where is my bench STOP I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I
can't find it STOP What have they done with my work STOP Time presses: I must
finish those shoes.”

They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them STOP “Come, come!” said he, in a whimpering miserable way; “let me get to
work STOP Give me my work.”

Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the
ground, like a distracted child STOP “Don't torture a poor forlorn wretch,” he implored them, with a dreadful
cry; “but give me my work STOP What is to become of us, if those shoes are
not done to-night?”

Lost, utterly lost STOP It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him,
that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and
soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should
have his work presently STOP He sank into the chair, and brooded over the
embers, and shed tears STOP As if all that had happened since the garret
time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into
the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping STOP Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle
of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions STOP His lonely
daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both
too strongly STOP Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with
one meaning in their faces STOP Carton was the first to speak:

“The last chance is gone: it was not much STOP Yes; he had better be taken
to her STOP But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to
me STOP Don't ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and
exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.”

“I do not doubt it,” answered Mr. Lorry STOP “Say on.”

The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously
rocking itself to and fro, and moaning STOP They spoke in such a tone as
they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the
night STOP Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his
feet STOP As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to
carry the lists of his day's duties, fell lightly on the floor STOP Carton
took it up, and there was a folded paper in it STOP “We should look
at this!” he said STOP Mr. Lorry nodded his consent STOP He opened it, and
exclaimed, “Thank _God!_”

“What is it?” asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly STOP “A moment STOP Let me speak of it in its place STOP First,” he put his hand in
his coat, and took another paper from it, “that is the certificate which
enables me to pass out of this city STOP Look at it STOP You see--Sydney Carton,
an Englishman?”

Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face STOP “Keep it for me until to-morrow STOP I shall see him to-morrow, you
remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.”

“Why not?”

“I don't know; I prefer not to do so STOP Now, take this paper that Doctor
Manette has carried about him STOP It is a similar certificate, enabling him
and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the
frontier STOP You see?”

“Yes!”

“Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil,
yesterday STOP When is it dated STOP But no matter; don't stay to look; put it
up carefully with mine and your own STOP Now, observe STOP I never doubted until
within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper STOP It is
good, until recalled STOP But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to
think, will be.”

“They are not in danger?”

“They are in great danger STOP They are in danger of denunciation by Madame
Defarge STOP I know it from her own lips STOP I have overheard words of that
woman's, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong
colours STOP I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy STOP He
confirms me STOP He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall,
is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by
Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her”--he never mentioned Lucie's
name--“making signs and signals to prisoners STOP It is easy to foresee that
the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will
involve her life--and perhaps her child's--and perhaps her father's--for
both have been seen with her at that place STOP Don't look so horrified STOP You
will save them all.”

“Heaven grant I may, Carton STOP But how?”

“I am going to tell you how STOP It will depend on you, and it could depend
on no better man STOP This new denunciation will certainly not take place
until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards;
more probably a week afterwards STOP You know it is a capital crime, to
mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine STOP She and her
father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the
inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that
strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure STOP You follow me?”

“So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for
the moment I lose sight,” touching the back of the Doctor's chair, “even
of this distress.”

“You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast
as quickly as the journey can be made STOP Your preparations have been
completed for some days, to return to England STOP Early to-morrow have your
horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o'clock in the
afternoon.”

“It shall be done!”

His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the
flame, and was as quick as youth STOP “You are a noble heart STOP Did I say we could depend upon no better man STOP Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child
and her father STOP Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head
beside her husband's cheerfully.” He faltered for an instant; then went
on as before STOP “For the sake of her child and her father, press upon her
the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour STOP Tell
her that it was her husband's last arrangement STOP Tell her that more
depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope STOP You think that her
father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?”

“I am sure of it.”

“I thought so STOP Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in
the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage STOP The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.”

“I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?”

“You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will
reserve my place STOP Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and
then for England!”

“Why, then,” said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady
hand, “it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young
and ardent man at my side.”

“By the help of Heaven you shall STOP Promise me solemnly that nothing will
influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one
another.”

“Nothing, Carton.”

“Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it--for
any reason--and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must
inevitably be sacrificed.”

“I will remember them STOP I hope to do my part faithfully.”

“And I hope to do mine STOP Now, good bye!”

Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even
put the old man's hand to his lips, he did not part from him then STOP He
helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers,
as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find
where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought
to have STOP He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the
courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in
the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to
it--outwatched the awful night STOP He entered the courtyard and remained
there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of
her room STOP Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a
Farewell STOP XIII STOP Fifty-two


In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited
their fate STOP They were in number as the weeks of the year STOP Fifty-two were
to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless
everlasting sea STOP Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants
were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday,
the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set
apart STOP Two score and twelve were told off STOP From the farmer-general of seventy,
whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose
poverty and obscurity could not save her STOP Physical diseases, engendered
in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees;
and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,
intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally
without distinction STOP Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no
flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal STOP In every line
of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation STOP He had
fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him,
that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could
avail him nothing STOP Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh
before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear STOP His hold on life
was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts
and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and
when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded,
this was closed again STOP There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts,
a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against
resignation STOP If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and
child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a
selfish thing STOP But, all this was at first STOP Before long, the consideration that there
was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same
road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate
him STOP Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude STOP So,
by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his
thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down STOP Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had
travelled thus far on his last way STOP Being allowed to purchase the means
of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the
prison lamps should be extinguished STOP He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing
of her father's imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself,
and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father's and uncle's
responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read STOP He had
already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name
he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that
her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he
had still exacted on the morning of their marriage STOP He entreated her,
for her father's sake, never to seek to know whether her father had
become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled
to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on
that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden STOP If he had
preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that
he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no
mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had
discovered there, and which had been described to all the world STOP He
besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console
her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think
of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly
reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint
sakes STOP Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and
blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their
dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her
father STOP To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her
father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care STOP And
he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any
despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be
tending STOP To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs STOP That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm
attachment, all was done STOP He never thought of Carton STOP His mind was so
full of the others, that he never once thought of him STOP He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out STOP When
he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world STOP But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining
forms STOP Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had
nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of
heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and
he had never gone away STOP A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even
suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there
was no difference in him STOP Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the
sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it
flashed upon his mind, “this is the day of my death!”

Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads
were to fall STOP And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could
meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking
thoughts, which was very difficult to master STOP He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life STOP How
high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be
stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed
red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first,
or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise
directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless
times STOP Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no
fear STOP Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like
the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own STOP The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the
numbers he would never hear again STOP Nine gone for ever, ten gone for
ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away STOP After a hard
contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
him, he had got the better of it STOP He walked up and down, softly
repeating their names to himself STOP The worst of the strife was over STOP He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for
himself and for them STOP Twelve gone for ever STOP He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would
be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily
and slowly through the streets STOP Therefore, he resolved to keep Two
before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others STOP Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very
different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force,
he heard One struck away from him, without surprise STOP The hour had
measured like most other hours STOP Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his
recovered self-possession, he thought, “There is but another now,” and
turned to walk again STOP Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door STOP He stopped STOP The key was put in the lock, and turned STOP Before the door was opened, or
as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: “He has never seen
me here; I have kept out of his way STOP Go you in alone; I wait near STOP Lose
no time!”

The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him
face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his
features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton STOP There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the
first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own
imagining STOP But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner's
hand, and it was his real grasp STOP “Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?” he said STOP “I could not believe it to be you STOP I can scarcely believe it now STOP You
are not”--the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--“a prisoner?”

“No STOP I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers
here, and in virtue of it I stand before you STOP I come from her--your
wife, dear Darnay.”

The prisoner wrung his hand STOP “I bring you a request from her.”

“What is it?”

“A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you
in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well
remember.”

The prisoner turned his face partly aside STOP “You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have
no time to tell you STOP You must comply with it--take off those boots you
wear, and draw on these of mine.”

There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner STOP Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got
him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot STOP “Draw on these boots of mine STOP Put your hands to them; put your will to
them STOP Quick!”

“Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done STOP You
will only die with me STOP It is madness.”

“It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I STOP When I ask you
to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here STOP Change
that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine STOP While you do
it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like
this of mine!”

With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action,
that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him STOP The prisoner was like a young child in his hands STOP “Carton STOP Dear Carton STOP It is madness STOP It cannot be accomplished, it never
can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed STOP I implore you
not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.”

“Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door STOP When I ask that,
refuse STOP There are pen and ink and paper on this table STOP Is your hand
steady enough to write?”

“It was when you came in.”

“Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate STOP Quick, friend, quick!”

Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table STOP Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him STOP “Write exactly as I speak.”

“To whom do I address it?”

“To no one.” Carton still had his hand in his breast STOP “Do I date it?”

“No.”

The prisoner looked up, at each question STOP Carton, standing over him with
his hand in his breast, looked down STOP “'If you remember,'” said Carton, dictating, “'the words that passed
between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it STOP You do remember them, I know STOP It is not in your nature to forget them STOP '”

He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look
up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon
something STOP “Have you written 'forget them'?” Carton asked STOP “I have STOP Is that a weapon in your hand?”

“No; I am not armed.”

“What is it in your hand?”

“You shall know directly STOP Write on; there are but a few words more.” He
dictated again STOP “'I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove
them STOP That I do so is no subject for regret or grief STOP '” As he said these
words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly
moved down close to the writer's face STOP The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about
him vacantly STOP “What vapour is that?” he asked STOP “Vapour?”

“Something that crossed me?”

“I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here STOP Take up the pen
and finish STOP Hurry, hurry!”

As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the
prisoner made an effort to rally his attention STOP As he looked at Carton
with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his
hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him STOP “Hurry, hurry!”

The prisoner bent over the paper, once more STOP “'If it had been otherwise;'” Carton's hand was again watchfully and
softly stealing down; “'I never should have used the longer opportunity STOP If it had been otherwise;'” the hand was at the prisoner's face; “'I
should but have had so much the more to answer for STOP If it had been
otherwise--'” Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into
unintelligible signs STOP Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more STOP The prisoner sprang up
with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his
nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist STOP For a few
seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his
life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on
the ground STOP Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton
dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back
his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn STOP Then, he
softly called, “Enter there STOP Come in!” and the Spy presented himself STOP “You see?” said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the
insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: “is your hazard very
great?”

“Mr STOP Carton,” the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, “my
hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to
the whole of your bargain.”

“Don't fear me STOP I will be true to the death.”

“You must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right STOP Being
made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.”

“Have no fear STOP I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the
rest will soon be far from here, please God STOP Now, get assistance and
take me to the coach.”

“You?” said the Spy nervously STOP “Him, man, with whom I have exchanged STOP You go out at the gate by which
you brought me in?”

“Of course.”

“I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you
take me out STOP The parting interview has overpowered me STOP Such a thing has
happened here, often, and too often STOP Your life is in your own hands STOP Quick STOP Call assistance!”

“You swear not to betray me?” said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a
last moment STOP “Man, man!” returned Carton, stamping his foot; “have I sworn by no
solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious
moments now STOP Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place
him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him
yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of
last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!”

The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his
forehead on his hands STOP The Spy returned immediately, with two men STOP “How, then?” said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure STOP “So
afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of
Sainte Guillotine?”

“A good patriot,” said the other, “could hardly have been more afflicted
if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.”

They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had
brought to the door, and bent to carry it away STOP “The time is short, Evremonde,” said the Spy, in a warning voice STOP “I know it well,” answered Carton STOP “Be careful of my friend, I entreat
you, and leave me.”

“Come, then, my children,” said Barsad STOP “Lift him, and come away!”

The door closed, and Carton was left alone STOP Straining his powers of
listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote
suspicion or alarm STOP There was none STOP Keys turned, doors clashed,
footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry
made, that seemed unusual STOP Breathing more freely in a little while, he
sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two STOP Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then
began to be audible STOP Several doors were opened in succession, and
finally his own STOP A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely
saying, “Follow me, Evremonde!” and he followed into a large dark room,
at a distance STOP It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows
within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern
the others who were brought there to have their arms bound STOP Some were
standing; some seated STOP Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;
but, these were few STOP The great majority were silent and still, looking
fixedly at the ground STOP As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two
were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him,
as having a knowledge of him STOP It thrilled him with a great dread of
discovery; but the man went on STOP A very few moments after that, a young
woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was
no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from
the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him STOP “Citizen Evremonde,” she said, touching him with her cold hand STOP “I am a
poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.”

He murmured for answer: “True STOP I forget what you were accused of?”

“Plots STOP Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any STOP Is it
likely STOP Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature
like me?”

The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears
started from his eyes STOP “I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing STOP I
am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good
to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be,
Citizen Evremonde STOP Such a poor weak little creature!”

As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it
warmed and softened to this pitiable girl STOP “I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde STOP I hoped it was true?”

“It was STOP But, I was again taken and condemned.”

“If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your
hand STOP I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me
more courage.”

As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in
them, and then astonishment STOP He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young
fingers, and touched his lips STOP “Are you dying for him?” she whispered STOP “And his wife and child STOP Hush STOP Yes.”

“O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?”

“Hush STOP Yes, my poor sister; to the last.”

        *****

The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that
same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about
it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined STOP “Who goes here STOP Whom have we within STOP Papers!”

The papers are handed out, and read STOP “Alexandre Manette STOP Physician STOP French STOP Which is he?”

This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man
pointed out STOP “Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind STOP The
Revolution-fever will have been too much for him?”

Greatly too much for him STOP “Hah STOP Many suffer with it STOP Lucie STOP His daughter STOP French STOP Which is she?”

This is she STOP “Apparently it must be STOP Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?”

It is STOP “Hah STOP Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere STOP Lucie, her child STOP English STOP This is she?”

She and no other STOP “Kiss me, child of Evremonde STOP Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican;
something new in thy family; remember it STOP Sydney Carton STOP Advocate STOP English STOP Which is he?”

He lies here, in this corner of the carriage STOP He, too, is pointed out STOP “Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?”

It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air STOP It is represented that
he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is
under the displeasure of the Republic STOP “Is that all STOP It is not a great deal, that STOP Many are under the
displeasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window STOP Jarvis Lorry STOP Banker STOP English STOP Which is he?”

“I am he STOP Necessarily, being the last.”

It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions STOP It
is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach
door, replying to a group of officials STOP They leisurely walk round the
carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it
carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to
the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its
mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of
an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine STOP “Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.”

“One can depart, citizen?”

“One can depart STOP Forward, my postilions STOP A good journey!”

“I salute you, citizens.--And the first danger passed!”

These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and
looks upward STOP There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there
is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller STOP “Are we not going too slowly STOP Can they not be induced to go faster?”
 asks Lucie, clinging to the old man STOP “It would seem like flight, my darling STOP I must not urge them too much;
it would rouse suspicion.”

“Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!”

“The road is clear, my dearest STOP So far, we are not pursued.”

Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings,
dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless
trees STOP The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on
either side STOP Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the
stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and
sloughs there STOP The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our
wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing
anything but stopping STOP Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary
farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes,
avenues of leafless trees STOP Have these men deceived us, and taken us back
by another road STOP Is not this the same place twice over STOP Thank Heaven,
no STOP A village STOP Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued STOP Hush STOP the posting-house STOP Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in
the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it
of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible
existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and
plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count
their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results STOP All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would
far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled STOP At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left
behind STOP We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and
on the low watery grounds STOP Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with
animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their
haunches STOP We are pursued STOP “Ho STOP Within the carriage there STOP Speak then!”

“What is it?” asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window STOP “How many did they say?”

“I do not understand you.”

“--At the last post STOP How many to the Guillotine to-day?”

“Fifty-two.”

“I said so STOP A brave number STOP My fellow-citizen here would have it
forty-two; ten more heads are worth having STOP The Guillotine goes
handsomely STOP I love it STOP Hi forward STOP Whoop!”

The night comes on dark STOP He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and
to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him,
by his name, what he has in his hand STOP O pity us, kind Heaven, and help
us STOP Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued STOP The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and
the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of
us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else STOP XIV STOP The Knitting Done


In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate
Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and
Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury STOP Not in the wine-shop did Madame
Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer,
erst a mender of roads STOP The sawyer himself did not participate in the
conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who
was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited STOP “But our Defarge,” said Jacques Three, “is undoubtedly a good
Republican STOP Eh?”

“There is no better,” the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill
notes, “in France.”

“Peace, little Vengeance,” said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with
a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips, “hear me speak STOP My husband,
fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved
well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence STOP But my husband has
his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.”

“It is a great pity,” croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head,
with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; “it is not quite like a good
citizen; it is a thing to regret.”

“See you,” said madame, “I care nothing for this Doctor, I STOP He may wear
his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to
me STOP But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and
child must follow the husband and father.”

“She has a fine head for it,” croaked Jacques Three STOP “I have seen blue
eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held
them up.” Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure STOP Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little STOP “The child also,” observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment
of his words, “has golden hair and blue eyes STOP And we seldom have a child
there STOP It is a pretty sight!”

“In a word,” said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction,
“I cannot trust my husband in this matter STOP Not only do I feel, since
last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects;
but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning,
and then they might escape.”

“That must never be,” croaked Jacques Three; “no one must escape STOP We
have not half enough as it is STOP We ought to have six score a day.”

“In a word,” Madame Defarge went on, “my husband has not my reason for
pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for
regarding this Doctor with any sensibility STOP I must act for myself,
therefore STOP Come hither, little citizen.”

The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the
submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap STOP “Touching those signals, little citizen,” said Madame Defarge, sternly,
“that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them
this very day?”

“Ay, ay, why not!” cried the sawyer STOP “Every day, in all weathers, from
two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes
without STOP I know what I know STOP I have seen with my eyes.”

He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had
never seen STOP “Clearly plots,” said Jacques Three STOP “Transparently!”

“There is no doubt of the Jury?” inquired Madame Defarge, letting her
eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile STOP “Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness STOP I answer for my
fellow-Jurymen.”

“Now, let me see,” said Madame Defarge, pondering again STOP “Yet once more STOP Can I spare this Doctor to my husband STOP I have no feeling either way STOP Can
I spare him?”

“He would count as one head,” observed Jacques Three, in a low voice STOP “We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.”

“He was signalling with her when I saw her,” argued Madame Defarge; “I
cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and
trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here STOP For, I am not a
bad witness.”

The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent
protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses STOP The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a
celestial witness STOP “He must take his chance,” said Madame Defarge STOP “No, I cannot spare
him STOP You are engaged at three o'clock; you are going to see the batch of
to-day executed.--You?”

The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in
the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent
of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of
Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of
smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national
barber STOP He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been
suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at
him out of Madame Defarge's head) of having his small individual fears
for his own personal safety, every hour in the day STOP “I,” said madame, “am equally engaged at the same place STOP After it is
over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we
will give information against these people at my Section.”

The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the
citizeness STOP The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded
her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and
hid his confusion over the handle of his saw STOP Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to
the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:

“She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death STOP She will
be mourning and grieving STOP She will be in a state of mind to impeach the
justice of the Republic STOP She will be full of sympathy with its enemies STOP I will go to her.”

“What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!” exclaimed Jacques
Three, rapturously STOP “Ah, my cherished!” cried The Vengeance; and
embraced her STOP “Take you my knitting,” said Madame Defarge, placing it in her
lieutenant's hands, “and have it ready for me in my usual seat STOP Keep
me my usual chair STOP Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a
greater concourse than usual, to-day.”

“I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,” said The Vengeance with
alacrity, and kissing her cheek STOP “You will not be late?”

“I shall be there before the commencement.”

“And before the tumbrils arrive STOP Be sure you are there, my soul,” said
The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the
street, “before the tumbrils arrive!”

Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and
might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the
mud, and round the corner of the prison wall STOP The Vengeance and the
Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative
of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments STOP There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded
than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets STOP Of a
strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great
determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart
to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an
instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have
heaved her up, under any circumstances STOP But, imbued from her childhood
with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,
opportunity had developed her into a tigress STOP She was absolutely without
pity STOP If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of
her STOP It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of
his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them STOP It was nothing to her, that
his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was
insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and
her prey, and as such had no right to live STOP To appeal to her, was made
hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself STOP If she had
been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which
she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had
been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any
softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
sent her there STOP Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe STOP Carelessly
worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her
dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap STOP Lying hidden in her
bosom, was a loaded pistol STOP Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened
dagger STOP Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such
a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown
sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets STOP Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment
waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,
the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's
attention STOP It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,
but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their
escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there STOP Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross
and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at
three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period STOP Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,
passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in
advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours
of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded STOP Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy STOP She and Jerry had
beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding
their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,
taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the
else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation STOP “Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose agitation
was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live:
“what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard STOP Another
carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken
suspicion.”

“My opinion, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “is as you're right STOP Likewise
wot I'll stand by you, right or wrong.”

“I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,” said
Miss Pross, wildly crying, “that I am incapable of forming any plan STOP Are
_you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?”

“Respectin' a future spear o' life, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “I
hope so STOP Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o'
mine, I think not STOP Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o'
two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here
crisis?”

“Oh, for gracious sake!” cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, “record
them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.”

“First,” said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with
an ashy and solemn visage, “them poor things well out o' this, never no
more will I do it, never no more!”

“I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,” returned Miss Pross, “that you
never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it
necessary to mention more particularly what it is.”

“No, miss,” returned Jerry, “it shall not be named to you STOP Second: them
poor things well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere with
Mrs. Cruncher's flopping, never no more!”

“Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,” said Miss Pross,
striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, “I have no doubt it
is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own
superintendence.--O my poor darlings!”

“I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a
most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--“and let my words
be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my
opinions respectin' flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only
hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present
time.”

“There, there, there STOP I hope she is, my dear man,” cried the distracted
Miss Pross, “and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.”

“Forbid it,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,
additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
out, “as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my
earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now STOP Forbid it as we shouldn't all
flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get 'em out o' this here dismal
risk STOP Forbid it, miss STOP Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!” This was Mr. Cruncher's
conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one STOP And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came
nearer and nearer STOP “If we ever get back to our native land,” said Miss Pross, “you may rely
upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and
understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events
you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in
earnest at this dreadful time STOP Now, pray let us think STOP My esteemed Mr.
Cruncher, let us think!”

Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer
and nearer STOP “If you were to go before,” said Miss Pross, “and stop the vehicle and
horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn't
that be best?”

Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best STOP “Where could you wait for me?” asked Miss Pross STOP Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
Temple Bar STOP Alas STOP Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame
Defarge was drawing very near indeed STOP “By the cathedral door,” said Miss Pross STOP “Would it be much out of
the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two
towers?”

“No, miss,” answered Mr. Cruncher STOP “Then, like the best of men,” said Miss Pross, “go to the posting-house
straight, and make that change.”

“I am doubtful,” said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,
“about leaving of you, you see STOP We don't know what may happen.”

“Heaven knows we don't,” returned Miss Pross, “but have no fear for me STOP Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o'Clock, or as near it as you can,
and I am sure it will be better than our going from here STOP I feel certain
of it STOP There STOP Bless you, Mr. Cruncher STOP Think-not of me, but of the lives
that may depend on both of us!”

This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty
clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher STOP With an encouraging nod or two, he
immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself
to follow as she had proposed STOP The having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross STOP The necessity of composing
her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the
streets, was another relief STOP She looked at her watch, and it was twenty
minutes past two STOP She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once STOP Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted
rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door
in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,
which were swollen and red STOP Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she
could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
was no one watching her STOP In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried
out, for she saw a figure standing in the room STOP The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of
Madame Defarge STOP By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,
those feet had come to meet that water STOP Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, “The wife of Evremonde;
where is she?”

It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open,
and would suggest the flight STOP Her first act was to shut them STOP There were
four in the room, and she shut them all STOP She then placed herself before
the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied STOP Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,
and rested on her when it was finished STOP Miss Pross had nothing beautiful
about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,
of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different
way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch STOP “You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,” said Miss
Pross, in her breathing STOP “Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of
me STOP I am an Englishwoman.”

Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of
Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay STOP She saw a tight,
hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a
woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by STOP She knew full well that
Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well
that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy STOP “On my way yonder,” said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of
her hand towards the fatal spot, “where they reserve my chair and my
knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing STOP I
wish to see her.”

“I know that your intentions are evil,” said Miss Pross, “and you may
depend upon it, I'll hold my own against them.”

Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's words;
both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what
the unintelligible words meant STOP “It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment,” said Madame Defarge STOP “Good patriots will know what that means STOP Let me see her STOP Go tell her that I wish to see her STOP Do you hear?”

“If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,” returned Miss Pross, “and I
was an English four-poster, they shouldn't loose a splinter of me STOP No,
you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.”

Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
at naught STOP “Woman imbecile and pig-like!” said Madame Defarge, frowning STOP “I take no
answer from you STOP I demand to see her STOP Either tell her that I demand
to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!”
 This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm STOP “I little thought,” said Miss Pross, “that I should ever want to
understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have,
except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any
part of it.”

Neither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes STOP Madame
Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross
first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step STOP “I am a Briton,” said Miss Pross, “I am desperate STOP I don't care an
English Twopence for myself STOP I know that the longer I keep you here, the
greater hope there is for my Ladybird STOP I'll not leave a handful of that
dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!”

Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath STOP Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life STOP But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
irrepressible tears into her eyes STOP This was a courage that Madame
Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness STOP “Ha, ha!” she
laughed, “you poor wretch STOP What are you worth STOP I address myself to that
Doctor.” Then she raised her voice and called out, “Citizen Doctor STOP Wife
of Evremonde STOP Child of Evremonde STOP Any person but this miserable fool,
answer the Citizeness Defarge!”

Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone STOP Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in STOP “Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there
are odds and ends upon the ground STOP There is no one in that room behind
you STOP Let me look.”

“Never!” said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as
Madame Defarge understood the answer STOP “If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and
brought back,” said Madame Defarge to herself STOP “As long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are
uncertain what to do,” said Miss Pross to herself; “and you shall not
know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know
that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.”

“I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,
I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,” said
Madame Defarge STOP “We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are
not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here,
while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to
my darling,” said Miss Pross STOP Madame Defarge made at the door STOP Miss Pross, on the instinct of the
moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight STOP It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross,
with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,
clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had STOP The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her
face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and
clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman STOP Soon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled
waist STOP “It is under my arm,” said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, “you
shall not draw it STOP I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it STOP I hold
you till one or other of us faints or dies!”

Madame Defarge's hands were at her bosom STOP Miss Pross looked up, saw
what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood
alone--blinded with smoke STOP All this was in a second STOP As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful
stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman
whose body lay lifeless on the ground STOP In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the
body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help STOP Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of
what she did, in time to check herself and go back STOP It was dreadful to
go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to
get the bonnet and other things that she must wear STOP These she put on,
out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking
away the key STOP She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe
and to cry, and then got up and hurried away STOP By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have
gone along the streets without being stopped STOP By good fortune, too, she
was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement
like any other woman STOP She needed both advantages, for the marks of
gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her
dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a
hundred ways STOP In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river STOP Arriving
at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there,
she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if
it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains
discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and
charged with murder STOP In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the
escort appeared, took her in, and took her away STOP “Is there any noise in the streets?” she asked him STOP “The usual noises,” Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect STOP “I don't hear you,” said Miss Pross STOP “What do you say?”

It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could
not hear him STOP “So I'll nod my head,” thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, “at
all events she'll see that.” And she did STOP “Is there any noise in the streets now?” asked Miss Pross again,
presently STOP Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head STOP “I don't hear it.”

“Gone deaf in an hour?” said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind
much disturbed; “wot's come to her?”

“I feel,” said Miss Pross, “as if there had been a flash and a crash,
and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.”

“Blest if she ain't in a queer condition!” said Mr. Cruncher, more and
more disturbed STOP “Wot can she have been a takin', to keep her courage up STOP Hark STOP There's the roll of them dreadful carts STOP You can hear that, miss?”

“I can hear,” said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, “nothing STOP O,
my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness,
and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be
broken any more as long as my life lasts.”

“If she don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their
journey's end,” said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, “it's my
opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.”

And indeed she never did STOP XV STOP The Footsteps Die Out For Ever


Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh STOP Six
tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine STOP All the devouring and
insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself,
are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine STOP And yet there is not in
France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf,
a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under
conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror STOP Crush
humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will
twist itself into the same tortured forms STOP Sow the same seed of
rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield
the same fruit according to its kind STOP Six tumbrils roll along the streets STOP Change these back again to what
they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be
the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the
toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father's
house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants STOP No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order
of the Creator, never reverses his transformations STOP “If thou be changed
into this shape by the will of God,” say the seers to the enchanted, in
the wise Arabian stories, “then remain so STOP But, if thou wear this
form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!”
 Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along STOP As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up
a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets STOP Ridges of faces
are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward STOP So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that
in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the
hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in
the tumbrils STOP Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight;
then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a
curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to
tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before STOP Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all
things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men STOP Some, seated with
drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as
they have seen in theatres, and in pictures STOP Several close their eyes,
and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together STOP Only one, and
he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made
drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance STOP Not one of the whole
number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people STOP There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,
and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some
question STOP It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is
always followed by a press of people towards the third cart STOP The
horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with
their swords STOP The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands
at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a
mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand STOP He has
no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the
girl STOP Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised
against him STOP If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he
shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face STOP He cannot easily
touch his face, his arms being bound STOP On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands
the Spy and prison-sheep STOP He looks into the first of them: not there STOP He looks into the second: not there STOP He already asks himself, “Has he
sacrificed me?” when his face clears, as he looks into the third STOP “Which is Evremonde?” says a man behind him STOP “That STOP At the back there.”

“With his hand in the girl's?”

“Yes.”

The man cries, “Down, Evremonde STOP To the Guillotine all aristocrats STOP Down, Evremonde!”

“Hush, hush!” the Spy entreats him, timidly STOP “And why not, citizen?”

“He is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more STOP Let him be at peace.”

But the man continuing to exclaim, “Down, Evremonde!” the face of
Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him STOP Evremonde then sees the
Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way STOP The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the
populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and
end STOP The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and
close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following
to the Guillotine STOP In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of
public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting STOP On one of the
fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend STOP “Therese!” she cries, in her shrill tones STOP “Who has seen her STOP Therese
Defarge!”

“She never missed before,” says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood STOP “No; nor will she miss now,” cries The Vengeance, petulantly STOP “Therese.”

“Louder,” the woman recommends STOP Ay STOP Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear
thee STOP Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet
it will hardly bring her STOP Send other women up and down to seek her,
lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread
deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her STOP “Bad Fortune!” cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, “and
here are the tumbrils STOP And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and
she not here STOP See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for
her STOP I cry with vexation and disappointment!”

As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads STOP The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are
robed and ready STOP Crash!--A head is held up, and the knitting-women who
scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could
think and speak, count One STOP The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up STOP Crash!--And
the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two STOP The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next
after him STOP He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but
still holds it as he promised STOP He gently places her with her back to the
crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into
his face and thanks him STOP “But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am
naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been
able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might
have hope and comfort here to-day STOP I think you were sent to me by
Heaven.”

“Or you to me,” says Sydney Carton STOP “Keep your eyes upon me, dear child,
and mind no other object.”

“I mind nothing while I hold your hand STOP I shall mind nothing when I let
it go, if they are rapid.”

“They will be rapid STOP Fear not!”

The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as
if they were alone STOP Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to
heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart
and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home
together, and to rest in her bosom STOP “Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question STOP I
am very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little.”

“Tell me what it is.”

“I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I
love very dearly STOP She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a
farmer's house in the south country STOP Poverty parted us, and she knows
nothing of my fate--for I cannot write--and if I could, how should I
tell her STOP It is better as it is.”

“Yes, yes: better as it is.”

“What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still
thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so
much support, is this:--If the Republic really does good to the poor,
and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may
live a long time: she may even live to be old.”

“What then, my gentle sister?”

“Do you think:” the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble:
“that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land
where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?”

“It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there.”

“You comfort me so much STOP I am so ignorant STOP Am I to kiss you now STOP Is the
moment come?”

“Yes.”

She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other STOP The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than
a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face STOP She goes next before
him--is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two STOP “I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.”

The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing
on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells
forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away STOP Twenty-Three STOP *****

They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the
peacefullest man's face ever beheld there STOP Many added that he looked
sublime and prophetic STOP One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe--a woman--had asked
at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to
write down the thoughts that were inspiring her STOP If he had given any
utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:

“I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the Judge,
long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of
the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease
out of its present use STOP I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people
rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in
their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil
of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural
birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out STOP “I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful,
prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more STOP I see
Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name STOP I see her father,
aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his
healing office, and at peace STOP I see the good old man, so long their
friend, in ten years' time enriching them with all he has, and passing
tranquilly to his reward STOP “I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of
their descendants, generations hence STOP I see her, an old woman, weeping
for me on the anniversary of this day STOP I see her and her husband, their
course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know
that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul,
than I was in the souls of both STOP “I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man
winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine STOP I see him
winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the
light of his STOP I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away STOP I see him,
fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name,
with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place--then fair to
look upon, with not a trace of this day's disfigurement--and I hear him
tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice STOP “It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a
far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.”

A TANGLED TALE STOP KNOT I.

EXCELSIOR STOP "Goblin, lead them up and down. STOP The ruddy glow of sunset was already fading into the sombre shadows of
night, when two travellers might have been observed swiftly--at a pace
of six miles in the hour--descending the rugged side of a mountain; the
younger bounding from crag to crag with the agility of a fawn, while his
companion, whose aged limbs seemed ill at ease in the heavy chain armour
habitually worn by tourists in that district, toiled on painfully at his
side STOP As is always the case under such circumstances, the younger knight was
the first to break the silence STOP "A goodly pace, I trow! STOP he exclaimed STOP "We sped not thus in the ascent! STOP "Goodly, indeed! STOP the other echoed with a groan STOP "We clomb it but at
three miles in the hour. STOP "And on the dead level our pace is----? STOP the younger suggested; for he
was weak in statistics, and left all such details to his aged companion STOP "Four miles in the hour," the other wearily replied STOP "Not an ounce
more," he added, with that love of metaphor so common in old age, "and
not a farthing less! STOP "'Twas three hours past high noon when we left our hostelry," the young
man said, musingly STOP "We shall scarce be back by supper-time STOP Perchance
mine host will roundly deny us all food! STOP "He will chide our tardy return," was the grave reply, "and such a
rebuke will be meet. STOP "A brave conceit! STOP cried the other, with a merry laugh STOP "And should we
bid him bring us yet another course, I trow his answer will be tart! STOP "We shall but get our deserts," sighed the elder knight, who had never
seen a joke in his life, and was somewhat displeased at his companion's
untimely levity STOP "'Twill be nine of the clock," he added in an
undertone, "by the time we regain our hostelry STOP Full many a mile shall
we have plodded this day! STOP "How many STOP How many? STOP cried the eager youth, ever athirst for knowledge STOP The old man was silent STOP "Tell me," he answered, after a moment's thought, "what time it was when
we stood together on yonder peak STOP Not exact to the minute! STOP he added
hastily, reading a protest in the young man's face STOP "An' thy guess be
within one poor half-hour of the mark, 'tis all I ask of thy mother's
son STOP Then will I tell thee, true to the last inch, how far we shall have
trudged betwixt three and nine of the clock. STOP A groan was the young man's only reply; while his convulsed features and
the deep wrinkles that chased each other across his manly brow, revealed
the abyss of arithmetical agony into which one chance question had
plunged him STOP KNOT II STOP ELIGIBLE APARTMENTS STOP "Straight down the crooked lane,
   And all round the square. STOP "Let's ask Balbus about it," said Hugh STOP "All right," said Lambert STOP "_He_ can guess it," said Hugh STOP "Rather," said Lambert STOP No more words were needed: the two brothers understood each other
perfectly STOP [Illustration: "BALBUS WAS ASSISTING HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW TO CONVINCE THE
DRAGON." STOP Balbus was waiting for them at the hotel: the journey down had tired
him, he said: so his two pupils had been the round of the place, in
search of lodgings, without the old tutor who had been their inseparable
companion from their childhood STOP They had named him after the hero of
their Latin exercise-book, which overflowed with anecdotes of that
versatile genius--anecdotes whose vagueness in detail was more than
compensated by their sensational brilliance STOP "Balbus has overcome all
his enemies" had been marked by their tutor, in the margin of the book,
"Successful Bravery. STOP In this way he had tried to extract a moral from
every anecdote about Balbus--sometimes one of warning, as in "Balbus had
borrowed a healthy dragon," against which he had written "Rashness in
Speculation"--sometimes of encouragement, as in the words "Influence of
Sympathy in United Action," which stood opposite to the anecdote "Balbus
was assisting his mother-in-law to convince the dragon"--and sometimes
it dwindled down to a single word, such as "Prudence," which was all he
could extract from the touching record that "Balbus, having scorched the
tail of the dragon, went away. STOP His pupils liked the short morals best,
as it left them more room for marginal illustrations, and in this
instance they required all the space they could get to exhibit the
rapidity of the hero's departure STOP Their report of the state of things was discouraging STOP That most
fashionable of watering-places, Little Mendip, was "chockfull" (as the
boys expressed it) from end to end STOP But in one Square they had seen no
less than four cards, in different houses, all announcing in flaming
capitals "ELIGIBLE APARTMENTS. STOP "So there's plenty of choice, after all,
you see," said spokesman Hugh in conclusion STOP "That doesn't follow from the data," said Balbus, as he rose from the
easy chair, where he had been dozing over _The Little Mendip Gazette_ STOP "They may be all single rooms STOP However, we may as well see them STOP I shall
be glad to stretch my legs a bit. STOP An unprejudiced bystander might have objected that the operation was
needless, and that this long, lank creature would have been all the
better with even shorter legs: but no such thought occurred to his
loving pupils STOP One on each side, they did their best to keep up with his
gigantic strides, while Hugh repeated the sentence in their father's
letter, just received from abroad, over which he and Lambert had been
puzzling STOP "He says a friend of his, the Governor of----_what_ was that
name again, Lambert? STOP ("Kgovjni," said Lambert. STOP "Well, yes STOP The
Governor of----what-you-may-call-it----wants to give a _very_ small
dinner-party, and he means to ask his father's brother-in-law, his
brother's father-in-law, his father-in-law's brother, and his
brother-in-law's father: and we're to guess how many guests there will
be. STOP There was an anxious pause STOP "_How_ large did he say the pudding was to
be? STOP Balbus said at last STOP "Take its cubical contents, divide by the
cubical contents of what each man can eat, and the quotient----"

"He didn't say anything about pudding," said Hugh, "--and here's the
Square," as they turned a corner and came into sight of the "eligible
apartments. STOP "It _is_ a Square! STOP was Balbus' first cry of delight, as he gazed around
him STOP "Beautiful STOP Beau-ti-ful STOP Equilateral STOP _And_ rectangular! STOP The boys looked round with less enthusiasm STOP "Number nine is the first
with a card," said prosaic Lambert; but Balbus would not so soon awake
from his dream of beauty STOP "See, boys! STOP he cried STOP "Twenty doors on a side STOP What symmetry STOP Each side
divided into twenty-one equal parts STOP It's delicious! STOP "Shall I knock, or ring? STOP said Hugh, looking in some perplexity at a
square brass plate which bore the simple inscription "RING ALSO. STOP "Both," said Balbus STOP "That's an Ellipsis, my boy STOP Did you never see an
Ellipsis before? STOP "I couldn't hardly read it," said Hugh, evasively STOP "It's no good having
an Ellipsis, if they don't keep it clean. STOP "Which there is _one_ room, gentlemen," said the smiling landlady STOP "And
a sweet room too STOP As snug a little back-room----"

"We will see it," said Balbus gloomily, as they followed her in STOP "I knew
how it would be STOP One room in each house STOP No view, I suppose? STOP "Which indeed there _is_, gentlemen! STOP the landlady indignantly
protested, as she drew up the blind, and indicated the back garden STOP "Cabbages, I perceive," said Balbus STOP "Well, they're green, at any rate. STOP "Which the greens at the shops," their hostess explained, "are by no
means dependable upon STOP Here you has them on the premises, _and_ of the
best. STOP "Does the window open? STOP was always Balbus' first question in testing a
lodging: and "Does the chimney smoke? STOP his second STOP Satisfied on all
points, he secured the refusal of the room, and they moved on to Number
Twenty-five STOP This landlady was grave and stern STOP "I've nobbut one room left," she
told them: "and it gives on the back-gyardin. STOP "But there are cabbages? STOP Balbus suggested STOP The landlady visibly relented STOP "There is, sir," she said: "and good
ones, though I say it as shouldn't STOP We can't rely on the shops for
greens STOP So we grows them ourselves. STOP "A singular advantage," said Balbus: and, after the usual questions,
they went on to Fifty-two STOP "And I'd gladly accommodate you all, if I could," was the greeting that
met them STOP "We are but mortal," ("Irrelevant! STOP muttered Balbus) "and I've
let all my rooms but one. STOP "Which one is a back-room, I perceive," said Balbus: "and looking out
on--on cabbages, I presume? STOP "Yes, indeed, sir! STOP said their hostess STOP "Whatever _other_ folks may do,
_we_ grows our own STOP For the shops----"

"An excellent arrangement! STOP Balbus interrupted STOP "Then one can really
depend on their being good STOP Does the window open? STOP The usual questions were answered satisfactorily: but this time Hugh
added one of his own invention--"Does the cat scratch? STOP The landlady looked round suspiciously, as if to make sure the cat was
not listening, "I will not deceive you, gentlemen," she said STOP "It _do_
scratch, but not without you pulls its whiskers STOP It'll never do it," she
repeated slowly, with a visible effort to recall the exact words of some
written agreement between herself and the cat, "without you pulls its
whiskers! STOP "Much may be excused in a cat so treated," said Balbus, as they left the
house and crossed to Number Seventy-three, leaving the landlady
curtseying on the doorstep, and still murmuring to herself her parting
words, as if they were a form of blessing, "---- not without you pulls
its whiskers! STOP At Number Seventy-three they found only a small shy girl to show the
house, who said "yes'm" in answer to all questions STOP "The usual room," said Balbus, as they marched in: "the usual
back-garden, the usual cabbages STOP I suppose you can't get them good at
the shops? STOP "Yes'm," said the girl STOP "Well, you may tell your mistress we will take the room, and that her
plan of growing her own cabbages is simply _admirable_! STOP "Yes'm," said the girl, as she showed them out STOP "One day-room and three bed-rooms," said Balbus, as they returned to the
hotel STOP "We will take as our day-room the one that gives us the least
walking to do to get to it. STOP "Must we walk from door to door, and count the steps? STOP said Lambert STOP "No, no STOP Figure it out, my boys, figure it out! STOP Balbus gaily exclaimed,
as he put pens, ink, and paper before his hapless pupils, and left the
room STOP "I say STOP It'll be a job! STOP said Hugh STOP "Rather! STOP said Lambert STOP KNOT III STOP MAD MATHESIS STOP "I waited for the train. STOP "Well, they call me so because I _am_ a little mad, I suppose," she
said, good-humouredly, in answer to Clara's cautiously-worded question
as to how she came by so strange a nick-name STOP "You see, I never do what
sane people are expected to do now-a-days STOP I never wear long trains,
(talking of trains, that's the Charing Cross Metropolitan Station--I've
something to tell you about _that_), and I never play lawn-tennis STOP I
can't cook an omelette STOP I can't even set a broken limb STOP _There's_ an
ignoramus for you! STOP Clara was her niece, and full twenty years her junior; in fact, she was
still attending a High School--an institution of which Mad Mathesis
spoke with undisguised aversion STOP "Let a woman be meek and lowly! STOP she
would say STOP "None of your High Schools for me! STOP But it was vacation-time
just now, and Clara was her guest, and Mad Mathesis was showing her the
sights of that Eighth Wonder of the world--London STOP "The Charing Cross Metropolitan Station! STOP she resumed, waving her hand
towards the entrance as if she were introducing her niece to a friend STOP "The Bayswater and Birmingham Extension is just completed, and the
trains now run round and round continuously--skirting the border of
Wales, just touching at York, and so round by the east coast back to
London STOP The way the trains run is _most_ peculiar STOP The westerly ones go
round in two hours; the easterly ones take three; but they always manage
to start two trains from here, opposite ways, punctually every
quarter-of-an-hour. STOP "They part to meet again," said Clara, her eyes filling with tears at
the romantic thought STOP "No need to cry about it! STOP her aunt grimly remarked STOP "They don't meet on
the same line of rails, you know STOP Talking of meeting, an idea strikes
me! STOP she added, changing the subject with her usual abruptness STOP "Let's
go opposite ways round, and see which can meet most trains STOP No need for
a chaperon--ladies' saloon, you know STOP You shall go whichever way you
like, and we'll have a bet about it! STOP "I never make bets," Clara said very gravely STOP "Our excellent preceptress
has often warned us----"

"You'd be none the worse if you did! STOP Mad Mathesis interrupted STOP "In
fact, you'd be the better, I'm certain! STOP "Neither does our excellent preceptress approve of puns," said Clara STOP "But we'll have a match, if you like STOP Let me choose my train," she added
after a brief mental calculation, "and I'll engage to meet exactly half
as many again as you do. STOP "Not if you count fair," Mad Mathesis bluntly interrupted STOP "Remember, we
only count the trains we meet _on the way_ STOP You mustn't count the one
that starts as you start, nor the one that arrives as you arrive. STOP "That will only make the difference of _one_ train," said Clara, as they
turned and entered the station STOP "But I never travelled alone before STOP There'll be no one to help me to alight STOP However, I don't mind STOP Let's
have a match. STOP A ragged little boy overheard her remark, and came running after her STOP "Buy a box of cigar-lights, Miss! STOP he pleaded, pulling her shawl to
attract her attention STOP Clara stopped to explain STOP "I never smoke cigars," she said in a meekly apologetic tone STOP "Our
excellent preceptress----," but Mad Mathesis impatiently hurried her on,
and the little boy was left gazing after her with round eyes of
amazement STOP The two ladies bought their tickets and moved slowly down the central
platform, Mad Mathesis prattling on as usual--Clara silent, anxiously
reconsidering the calculation on which she rested her hopes of winning
the match STOP "Mind where you go, dear! STOP cried her aunt, checking her just in time STOP "One step more, and you'd have been in that pail of cold water! STOP "I know, I know," Clara said, dreamily STOP "The pale, the cold, and the
moony----"

"Take your places on the spring-boards! STOP shouted a porter STOP "What are _they_ for! STOP Clara asked in a terrified whisper STOP "Merely to help us into the trains. STOP The elder lady spoke with the
nonchalance of one quite used to the process STOP "Very few people can get
into a carriage without help in less than three seconds, and the trains
only stop for one second. STOP At this moment the whistle was heard, and two
trains rushed into the station STOP A moment's pause, and they were gone
again; but in that brief interval several hundred passengers had been
shot into them, each flying straight to his place with the accuracy of a
Minie bullet--while an equal number were showered out upon the
side-platforms STOP Three hours had passed away, and the two friends met again on the
Charing Cross platform, and eagerly compared notes STOP Then Clara turned
away with a sigh STOP To young impulsive hearts, like hers, disappointment
is always a bitter pill STOP Mad Mathesis followed her, full of kindly
sympathy STOP "Try again, my love! STOP she said, cheerily STOP "Let us vary the experiment STOP We will start as we did before, but not to begin counting till our
trains meet STOP When we see each other, we will say 'One! STOP and so count on
till we come here again. STOP Clara brightened up STOP "I shall win _that_," she exclaimed eagerly, "if I
may choose my train! STOP Another shriek of engine whistles, another upheaving of spring-boards,
another living avalanche plunging into two trains as they flashed by:
and the travellers were off again STOP Each gazed eagerly from her carriage window, holding up her handkerchief
as a signal to her friend STOP A rush and a roar STOP Two trains shot past each
other in a tunnel, and two travellers leaned back in their corners with
a sigh--or rather with _two_ sighs--of relief STOP "One! STOP Clara murmured to
herself STOP "Won STOP It's a word of good omen STOP _This_ time, at any rate, the
victory will be mine! STOP But _was_ it STOP KNOT IV STOP THE DEAD RECKONING STOP "I did dream of money-bags to-night. STOP Noonday on the open sea within a few degrees of the Equator is apt to be
oppressively warm; and our two travellers were now airily clad in suits
of dazzling white linen, having laid aside the chain-armour which they
had found not only endurable in the cold mountain air they had lately
been breathing, but a necessary precaution against the daggers of the
banditti who infested the heights STOP Their holiday-trip was over, and they
were now on their way home, in the monthly packet which plied between
the two great ports of the island they had been exploring STOP Along with their armour, the tourists had laid aside the antiquated
speech it had pleased them to affect while in knightly disguise, and
had returned to the ordinary style of two country gentlemen of the
Twentieth Century STOP Stretched on a pile of cushions, under the shade of a huge umbrella,
they were lazily watching some native fishermen, who had come on board
at the last landing-place, each carrying over his shoulder a small but
heavy sack STOP A large weighing-machine, that had been used for cargo at
the last port, stood on the deck; and round this the fishermen had
gathered, and, with much unintelligible jabber, seemed to be weighing
their sacks STOP "More like sparrows in a tree than human talk, isn't it? STOP the elder
tourist remarked to his son, who smiled feebly, but would not exert
himself so far as to speak STOP The old man tried another listener STOP "What have they got in those sacks, Captain? STOP he inquired, as that great
being passed them in his never ending parade to and fro on the deck STOP The Captain paused in his march, and towered over the travellers--tall,
grave, and serenely self-satisfied STOP "Fishermen," he explained, "are often passengers in My ship STOP These five
are from Mhruxi--the place we last touched at--and that's the way they
carry their money STOP The money of this island is heavy, gentlemen, but it
costs little, as you may guess STOP We buy it from them by weight--about
five shillings a pound STOP I fancy a ten pound-note would buy all those
sacks. STOP By this time the old man had closed his eyes--in order, no doubt, to
concentrate his thoughts on these interesting facts; but the Captain
failed to realise his motive, and with a grunt resumed his monotonous
march STOP Meanwhile the fishermen were getting so noisy over the weighing-machine
that one of the sailors took the precaution of carrying off all the
weights, leaving them to amuse themselves with such substitutes in the
form of winch-handles, belaying-pins, &c., as they could find STOP This
brought their excitement to a speedy end: they carefully hid their sacks
in the folds of the jib that lay on the deck near the tourists, and
strolled away STOP When next the Captain's heavy footfall passed, the younger man roused
himself to speak STOP "_What_ did you call the place those fellows came from, Captain? STOP he
asked STOP "Mhruxi, sir. STOP "And the one we are bound for? STOP The Captain took a long breath, plunged into the word, and came out of
it nobly STOP "They call it Kgovjni, sir. STOP "K--I give it up! STOP the young man faintly said STOP He stretched out his hand for a glass of iced water which the
compassionate steward had brought him a minute ago, and had set down,
unluckily, just outside the shadow of the umbrella STOP It was scalding hot,
and he decided not to drink it STOP The effort of making this resolution,
coming close on the fatiguing conversation he had just gone through, was
too much for him: he sank back among the cushions in silence STOP His father courteously tried to make amends for his _nonchalance_ STOP "Whereabouts are we now, Captain? STOP said he, "Have you any idea? STOP The Captain cast a pitying look on the ignorant landsman STOP "I could tell
you _that_, sir," he said, in a tone of lofty condescension, "to an
inch! STOP "You don't say so! STOP the old man remarked, in a tone of languid surprise STOP "And mean so," persisted the Captain STOP "Why, what do you suppose would
become of My ship, if I were to lose My Longitude and My Latitude STOP Could _you_ make anything of My Dead Reckoning? STOP "Nobody could, I'm sure! STOP the other heartily rejoined STOP But he had overdone it STOP "It's _perfectly_ intelligible," the Captain said, in an offended tone,
"to any one that understands such things. STOP With these words he moved
away, and began giving orders to the men, who were preparing to hoist
the jib STOP Our tourists watched the operation with such interest that neither of
them remembered the five money-bags, which in another moment, as the
wind filled out the jib, were whirled overboard and fell heavily into
the sea STOP But the poor fishermen had not so easily forgotten their property STOP In a
moment they had rushed to the spot, and stood uttering cries of fury,
and pointing, now to the sea, and now to the sailors who had caused the
disaster STOP The old man explained it to the Captain STOP "Let us make it up among us," he added in conclusion STOP "Ten pounds will
do it, I think you said? STOP [Illustration]

But the Captain put aside the suggestion with a wave of the hand STOP "No, sir! STOP he said, in his grandest manner STOP "You will excuse Me, I am
sure; but these are My passengers STOP The accident has happened on board My
ship, and under My orders STOP It is for Me to make compensation. STOP He
turned to the angry fishermen STOP "Come here, my men! STOP he said, in the
Mhruxian dialect STOP "Tell me the weight of each sack STOP I saw you weighing
them just now. STOP Then ensued a perfect Babel of noise, as the five natives explained, all
screaming together, how the sailors had carried off the weights, and
they had done what they could with whatever came handy STOP Two iron belaying-pins, three blocks, six holystones, four
winch-handles, and a large hammer, were now carefully weighed, the
Captain superintending and noting the results STOP But the matter did not
seem to be settled, even then: an angry discussion followed, in which
the sailors and the five natives all joined: and at last the Captain
approached our tourists with a disconcerted look, which he tried to
conceal under a laugh STOP "It's an absurd difficulty," he said STOP "Perhaps one of you gentlemen can
suggest something STOP It seems they weighed the sacks two at a time! STOP "If they didn't have five separate weighings, of course you can't value
them separately," the youth hastily decided STOP "Let's hear all about it," was the old man's more cautious remark STOP "They _did_ have five separate weighings," the Captain said, "but--Well,
it beats _me_ entirely! STOP he added, in a sudden burst of candour STOP "Here's
the result STOP First and second sack weighed twelve pounds; second and
third, thirteen and a half; third and fourth, eleven and a half; fourth
and fifth, eight: and then they say they had only the large hammer left,
and it took _three_ sacks to weigh it down--that's the first, third and
fifth--and _they_ weighed sixteen pounds STOP There, gentlemen STOP Did you ever
hear anything like _that_? STOP The old man muttered under his breath "If only my sister were here! STOP and
looked helplessly at his son STOP His son looked at the five natives STOP The
five natives looked at the Captain STOP The Captain looked at nobody: his
eyes were cast down, and he seemed to be saying softly to himself
"Contemplate one another, gentlemen, if such be your good pleasure STOP _I_
contemplate _Myself_! STOP KNOT V.

OUGHTS AND CROSSES STOP "Look here, upon this picture, and on this. STOP "And what made you choose the first train, Goosey? STOP said Mad Mathesis,
as they got into the cab STOP "Couldn't you count better than _that_? STOP "I took an extreme case," was the tearful reply STOP "Our excellent
preceptress always says 'When in doubt, my dears, take an extreme case. STOP And I _was_ in doubt. STOP "Does it always succeed? STOP her aunt enquired STOP Clara sighed STOP "Not _always_," she reluctantly admitted STOP "And I can't
make out why STOP One day she was telling the little girls--they make such a
noise at tea, you know--'The more noise you make, the less jam you will
have, and _vice versa_. STOP And I thought they wouldn't know what '_vice
versa_' meant: so I explained it to them STOP I said 'If you make an
infinite noise, you'll get no jam: and if you make no noise, you'll get
an infinite lot of jam. STOP But our excellent preceptress said that wasn't
a good instance STOP _Why_ wasn't it? STOP she added plaintively STOP Her aunt evaded the question STOP "One sees certain objections to it," she
said STOP "But how did you work it with the Metropolitan trains STOP None of
them go infinitely fast, I believe. STOP "I called them hares and tortoises," Clara said--a little timidly, for
she dreaded being laughed at STOP "And I thought there couldn't be so many
hares as tortoises on the Line: so I took an extreme case--one hare and
an infinite number of tortoises. STOP "An extreme case, indeed," her aunt remarked with admirable gravity:
"and a most dangerous state of things! STOP "And I thought, if I went with a tortoise, there would be only _one_
hare to meet: but if I went with the hare--you know there were _crowds_
of tortoises! STOP "It wasn't a bad idea," said the elder lady, as they left the cab, at
the entrance of Burlington House STOP "You shall have another chance to-day STOP We'll have a match in marking pictures. STOP Clara brightened up STOP "I should like to try again, very much," she said STOP "I'll take more care this time STOP How are we to play? STOP To this question Mad Mathesis made no reply: she was busy drawing lines
down the margins of the catalogue STOP "See," she said after a minute, "I've
drawn three columns against the names of the pictures in the long room,
and I want you to fill them with oughts and crosses--crosses for good
marks and oughts for bad STOP The first column is for choice of subject, the
second for arrangement, the third for colouring STOP And these are the
conditions of the match STOP You must give three crosses to two or three
pictures STOP You must give two crosses to four or five----"

"Do you mean _only_ two crosses? STOP said Clara STOP "Or may I count the
three-cross pictures among the two-cross pictures? STOP "Of course you may," said her aunt STOP "Any one, that has _three_ eyes, may
be said to have _two_ eyes, I suppose? STOP Clara followed her aunt's dreamy gaze across the crowded gallery,
half-dreading to find that there was a three-eyed person in sight STOP "And you must give one cross to nine or ten. STOP "And which wins the match? STOP Clara asked, as she carefully entered these
conditions on a blank leaf in her catalogue STOP "Whichever marks fewest pictures. STOP "But suppose we marked the same number? STOP "Then whichever uses most marks. STOP Clara considered STOP "I don't think it's much of a match," she said STOP "I
shall mark nine pictures, and give three crosses to three of them, two
crosses to two more, and one cross each to all the rest. STOP "Will you, indeed? STOP said her aunt STOP "Wait till you've heard all the
conditions, my impetuous child STOP You must give three oughts to one or two
pictures, two oughts to three or four, and one ought to eight or nine STOP I
don't want you to be _too_ hard on the R.A.'s. STOP Clara quite gasped as she wrote down all these fresh conditions STOP "It's a
great deal worse than Circulating Decimals! STOP she said STOP "But I'm
determined to win, all the same! STOP Her aunt smiled grimly STOP "We can begin _here_," she said, as they paused
before a gigantic picture, which the catalogue informed them was the
"Portrait of Lieutenant Brown, mounted on his favorite elephant. STOP "He looks awfully conceited! STOP said Clara STOP "I don't think he was the
elephant's favorite Lieutenant STOP What a hideous picture it is STOP And it
takes up room enough for twenty! STOP "Mind what you say, my dear! STOP her aunt interposed STOP "It's by an R.A.! STOP But Clara was quite reckless STOP "I don't care who it's by! STOP she cried STOP "And I shall give it three bad marks! STOP Aunt and niece soon drifted away from each other in the crowd, and for
the next half-hour Clara was hard at work, putting in marks and rubbing
them out again, and hunting up and down for suitable pictures STOP This she
found the hardest part of all STOP "I _can't_ find the one I want! STOP she
exclaimed at last, almost crying with vexation STOP "What is it you want to find, my dear? STOP The voice was strange to Clara,
but so sweet and gentle that she felt attracted to the owner of it, even
before she had seen her; and when she turned, and met the smiling looks
of two little old ladies, whose round dimpled faces, exactly alike,
seemed never to have known a care, it was as much as she could do--as
she confessed to Aunt Mattie afterwards--to keep herself from hugging
them both STOP "I was looking for a picture," she said, "that has a good subject--and
that's well arranged--but badly coloured. STOP The little old ladies glanced at each other in some alarm STOP "Calm
yourself, my dear," said the one who had spoken first, "and try to
remember which it was STOP What _was_ the subject? STOP "Was it an elephant, for instance? STOP the other sister suggested STOP They
were still in sight of Lieutenant Brown STOP "I don't know, indeed! STOP Clara impetuously replied STOP "You know it doesn't
matter a bit what the subject _is_, so long as it's a good one! STOP Once more the sisters exchanged looks of alarm, and one of them
whispered something to the other, of which Clara caught only the one
word "mad. STOP "They mean Aunt Mattie, of course," she said to herself--fancying, in
her innocence, that London was like her native town, where everybody
knew everybody else STOP "If you mean my aunt," she added aloud, "she's
_there_--just three pictures beyond Lieutenant Brown. STOP "Ah, well STOP Then you'd better go to her, my dear! STOP her new friend said,
soothingly STOP "_She'll_ find you the picture you want STOP Good-bye, dear! STOP "Good-bye, dear! STOP echoed the other sister, "Mind you don't lose sight of
your aunt! STOP And the pair trotted off into another room, leaving Clara
rather perplexed at their manner STOP "They're real darlings! STOP she soliloquised STOP "I wonder why they pity me
so! STOP And she wandered on, murmuring to herself "It must have two good
marks, and----"




KNOT VI STOP HER RADIANCY STOP "One piecee thing that my have got,
     Maskee[A] that thing my no can do STOP You talkee you no sabey what STOP Bamboo. STOP They landed, and were at once conducted to the Palace STOP About half way
they were met by the Governor, who welcomed them in English--a great
relief to our travellers, whose guide could speak nothing but Kgovjnian STOP "I don't half like the way they grin at us as we go by! STOP the old man
whispered to his son STOP "And why do they say 'Bamboo! STOP so often? STOP "It alludes to a local custom," replied the Governor, who had overheard
the question STOP "Such persons as happen in any way to displease Her
Radiancy are usually beaten with rods. STOP [Illustration: "WHY DO THEY SAY 'BAMBOO! STOP SO OFTEN?" STOP The old man shuddered STOP "A most objectional local custom! STOP he remarked
with strong emphasis STOP "I wish we had never landed STOP Did you notice that
black fellow, Norman, opening his great mouth at us STOP I verily believe he
would like to eat us! STOP Norman appealed to the Governor, who was walking at his other side STOP "Do
they often eat distinguished strangers here? STOP he said, in as indifferent
a tone as he could assume STOP "Not often--not ever! STOP was the welcome reply STOP "They are not good for it STOP Pigs we eat, for they are fat STOP This old man is thin. STOP "And thankful to be so! STOP muttered the elder traveller STOP "Beaten we shall
be without a doubt STOP It's a comfort to know it won't be Beaten without
the B STOP My dear boy, just look at the peacocks! STOP They were now walking between two unbroken lines of those gorgeous
birds, each held in check, by means of a golden collar and chain, by a
black slave, who stood well behind, so as not to interrupt the view of
the glittering tail, with its network of rustling feathers and its
hundred eyes STOP The Governor smiled proudly STOP "In your honour," he said, "Her Radiancy
has ordered up ten thousand additional peacocks STOP She will, no doubt,
decorate you, before you go, with the usual Star and Feathers. STOP "It'll be Star without the S! STOP faltered one of his hearers STOP "Come, come STOP Don't lose heart! STOP said the other STOP "All this is full of
charm for me. STOP "You are young, Norman," sighed his father; "young and light-hearted STOP For me, it is Charm without the C."

"The old one is sad," the Governor remarked with some anxiety STOP "He has,
without doubt, effected some fearful crime? STOP "But I haven't! STOP the poor old gentleman hastily exclaimed STOP "Tell him I
haven't, Norman! STOP "He has not, as yet," Norman gently explained STOP And the Governor
repeated, in a satisfied tone, "Not as yet. STOP "Yours is a wondrous country! STOP the Governor resumed, after a pause STOP "Now
here is a letter from a friend of mine, a merchant, in London STOP He and
his brother went there a year ago, with a thousand pounds apiece; and on
New-Year's-day they had sixty thousand pounds between them! STOP "How did they do it? STOP Norman eagerly exclaimed STOP Even the elder traveller
looked excited STOP The Governor handed him the open letter STOP "Anybody can do it, when once
they know how," so ran this oracular document STOP "We borrowed nought: we
stole nought STOP We began the year with only a thousand pounds apiece: and
last New-Year's-day we had sixty thousand pounds between us--sixty
thousand golden sovereigns! STOP Norman looked grave and thoughtful as he handed back the letter STOP His
father hazarded one guess STOP "Was it by gambling? STOP "A Kgovjnian never gambles," said the Governor gravely, as he ushered
them through the palace gates STOP They followed him in silence down a long
passage, and soon found themselves in a lofty hall, lined entirely with
peacocks' feathers STOP In the centre was a pile of crimson cushions, which
almost concealed the figure of Her Radiancy--a plump little damsel, in a
robe of green satin dotted with silver stars, whose pale round face lit
up for a moment with a half-smile as the travellers bowed before her,
and then relapsed into the exact expression of a wax doll, while she
languidly murmured a word or two in the Kgovjnian dialect STOP The Governor interpreted STOP "Her Radiancy welcomes you STOP She notes the
Impenetrable Placidity of the old one, and the Imperceptible Acuteness
of the youth. STOP Here the little potentate clapped her hands, and a troop of slaves
instantly appeared, carrying trays of coffee and sweetmeats, which they
offered to the guests, who had, at a signal from the Governor, seated
themselves on the carpet STOP "Sugar-plums! STOP muttered the old man STOP "One might as well be at a
confectioner's STOP Ask for a penny bun, Norman! STOP "Not so loud! STOP his son whispered STOP "Say something complimentary! STOP For the
Governor was evidently expecting a speech STOP "We thank Her Exalted Potency," the old man timidly began STOP "We bask in
the light of her smile, which----"

"The words of old men are weak! STOP the Governor interrupted angrily STOP "Let
the youth speak! STOP "Tell her," cried Norman, in a wild burst of eloquence, "that, like two
grasshoppers in a volcano, we are shrivelled up in the presence of Her
Spangled Vehemence! STOP "It is well," said the Governor, and translated this into Kgovjnian STOP "I
am now to tell you," he proceeded, "what Her Radiancy requires of you
before you go STOP The yearly competition for the post of Imperial
Scarf-maker is just ended; you are the judges STOP You will take account of
the rate of work, the lightness of the scarves, and their warmth STOP Usually the competitors differ in one point only STOP Thus, last year, Fifi
and Gogo made the same number of scarves in the trial-week, and they
were equally light; but Fifi's were twice as warm as Gogo's and she was
pronounced twice as good STOP But this year, woe is me, who can judge it STOP Three competitors are here, and they differ in all points STOP While you
settle their claims, you shall be lodged, Her Radiancy bids me say, free
of expense--in the best dungeon, and abundantly fed on the best bread
and water. STOP The old man groaned STOP "All is lost! STOP he wildly exclaimed STOP But Norman
heeded him not: he had taken out his note-book, and was calmly jotting
down the particulars STOP "Three they be," the Governor proceeded, "Lolo, Mimi, and Zuzu STOP Lolo
makes 5 scarves while Mimi makes 2; but Zuzu makes 4 while Lolo makes 3 STOP Again, so fairylike is Zuzu's handiwork, 5 of her scarves weigh no more
than one of Lolo's; yet Mimi's is lighter still--5 of hers will but
balance 3 of Zuzu's STOP And for warmth one of Mimi's is equal to 4 of
Zuzu's; yet one of Lolo's is as warm as 3 of Mimi's! STOP Here the little lady once more clapped her hands STOP "It is our signal of dismissal! STOP the Governor hastily said STOP "Pay Her
Radiancy your farewell compliments--and walk out backwards. STOP The walking part was all the elder tourist could manage STOP Norman simply
said "Tell Her Radiancy we are transfixed by the spectacle of Her Serene
Brilliance, and bid an agonized farewell to her Condensed Milkiness! STOP "Her Radiancy is pleased," the Governor reported, after duly translating
this STOP "She casts on you a glance from Her Imperial Eyes, and is
confident that you will catch it! STOP "That I warrant we shall! STOP the elder traveller moaned to himself
distractedly STOP Once more they bowed low, and then followed the Governor down a winding
staircase to the Imperial Dungeon, which they found to be lined with
coloured marble, lighted from the roof, and splendidly though not
luxuriously furnished with a bench of polished malachite STOP "I trust you
will not delay the calculation," the Governor said, ushering them in
with much ceremony STOP "I have known great inconvenience--great and serious
inconvenience--result to those unhappy ones who have delayed to execute
the commands of Her Radiancy STOP And on this occasion she is resolute: she
says the thing must and shall be done: and she has ordered up ten
thousand additional bamboos! STOP With these words he left them, and they
heard him lock and bar the door on the outside STOP "I told you how it would end! STOP moaned the elder traveller, wringing his
hands, and quite forgetting in his anguish that he had himself proposed
the expedition, and had never predicted anything of the sort STOP "Oh that
we were well out of this miserable business! STOP "Courage! STOP cried the younger cheerily STOP "_Haec olim meminisse juvabit!_
The end of all this will be glory! STOP "Glory without the L! STOP was all the poor old man could say, as he rocked
himself to and fro on the malachite bench STOP "Glory without the L! STOP FOOTNOTE:

forget it if you don't! STOP "My dear, we really must wait till the cab stops STOP How can I possibly
write anything in the midst of all this jolting? STOP "But _really_ I shall be forgetting it! STOP Clara's voice took the plaintive tone that her aunt never knew how to
resist, and with a sigh the old lady drew forth her ivory tablets and
prepared to record the amount that Clara had just spent at the
confectioner's shop STOP Her expenditure was always made out of her aunt's
purse, but the poor girl knew, by bitter experience, that sooner or
later "Mad Mathesis" would expect an exact account of every penny that
had gone, and she waited, with ill-concealed impatience, while the old
lady turned the tablets over and over, till she had found the one headed
"PETTY CASH. STOP "Here's the place," she said at last, "and here we have yesterday's
luncheon duly entered STOP _One glass lemonade_ (Why can't you drink water,
like me? STOP _three sandwiches_ (They never put in half mustard enough STOP I
told the young woman so, to her face; and she tossed her head--like her
impudence! STOP _and seven biscuits_ STOP _Total one-and-two-pence._ Well, now
for to-day's? STOP "One glass of lemonade----" Clara was beginning to say, when suddenly
the cab drew up, and a courteous railway-porter was handing out the
bewildered girl before she had had time to finish her sentence STOP Her aunt pocketed the tablets instantly STOP "Business first," she said:
"petty cash--which is a form of pleasure, whatever _you_ may
think--afterwards. STOP And she proceeded to pay the driver, and to give
voluminous orders about the luggage, quite deaf to the entreaties of her
unhappy niece that she would enter the rest of the luncheon account STOP "My dear, you really must cultivate a more capacious mind! STOP was all the
consolation she vouchsafed to the poor girl STOP "Are not the tablets of
your memory wide enough to contain the record of one single luncheon? STOP "Not wide enough STOP Not half wide enough! STOP was the passionate reply STOP The words came in aptly enough, but the voice was not that of Clara, and
both ladies turned in some surprise to see who it was that had so
suddenly struck into their conversation STOP A fat little old lady was
standing at the door of a cab, helping the driver to extricate what
seemed an exact duplicate of herself: it would have been no easy task to
decide which was the fatter, or which looked the more good-humoured of
the two sisters STOP "I tell you the cab-door isn't half wide enough! STOP she repeated, as her
sister finally emerged, somewhat after the fashion of a pellet from a
pop-gun, and she turned to appeal to Clara STOP "Is it, dear? STOP she said,
trying hard to bring a frown into a face that dimpled all over with
smiles STOP "Some folks is too wide for 'em," growled the cab-driver STOP [Illustration: "I TELL YOU THE CAB-DOOR ISN'T HALF WIDE ENOUGH!" STOP "Don't provoke me, man! STOP cried the little old lady, in what she meant
for a tempest of fury STOP "Say another word and I'll put you into the
County Court, and sue you for a _Habeas Corpus_! STOP The cabman touched his
hat, and marched off, grinning STOP "Nothing like a little Law to cow the ruffians, my dear! STOP she remarked
confidentially to Clara STOP "You saw how he quailed when I mentioned the
_Habeas Corpus_ STOP Not that I've any idea what it means, but it sounds
very grand, doesn't it? STOP "It's very provoking," Clara replied, a little vaguely STOP "Very! STOP the little old lady eagerly repeated STOP "And we're very much
provoked indeed STOP Aren't we, sister? STOP "I never was so provoked in all my life! STOP the fatter sister assented,
radiantly STOP By this time Clara had recognised her picture-gallery acquaintances,
and, drawing her aunt aside, she hastily whispered her reminiscences STOP "I
met them first in the Royal Academy--and they were very kind to me--and
they were lunching at the next table to us, just now, you know--and they
tried to help me to find the picture I wanted--and I'm sure they're dear
old things! STOP "Friends of yours, are they? STOP said Mad Mathesis STOP "Well, I like their
looks STOP You can be civil to them, while I get the tickets STOP But do try and
arrange your ideas a little more chronologically! STOP And so it came to pass that the four ladies found themselves seated side
by side on the same bench waiting for the train, and chatting as if they
had known one another for years STOP "Now this I call quite a remarkable coincidence! STOP exclaimed the smaller
and more talkative of the two sisters--the one whose legal knowledge had
annihilated the cab-driver STOP "Not only that we should be waiting for the
same train, and at the same station--_that_ would be curious enough--but
actually on the same day, and the same hour of the day STOP That's what
strikes _me_ so forcibly! STOP She glanced at the fatter and more silent
sister, whose chief function in life seemed to be to support the family
opinion, and who meekly responded--

"And me too, sister! STOP "Those are not _independent_ coincidences----" Mad Mathesis was just
beginning, when Clara ventured to interpose STOP "There's no jolting here," she pleaded meekly STOP "_Would_ you mind writing
it down now? STOP Out came the ivory tablets once more STOP "What was it, then? STOP said her
aunt STOP "One glass of lemonade, one sandwich, one biscuit--Oh dear me! STOP cried
poor Clara, the historical tone suddenly changing to a wail of agony STOP "Toothache? STOP said her aunt calmly, as she wrote down the items STOP The two
sisters instantly opened their reticules and produced two different
remedies for neuralgia, each marked "unequalled. STOP "It isn't that! STOP said poor Clara STOP "Thank you very much STOP It's only that I
_can't_ remember how much I paid! STOP "Well, try and make it out, then," said her aunt STOP "You've got
yesterday's luncheon to help you, you know STOP And here's the luncheon we
had the day before--the first day we went to that shop--_one
glass lemonade_, _four sandwiches_, _ten biscuits_ STOP _Total,
one-and-fivepence._" She handed the tablets to Clara, who gazed at them
with eyes so dim with tears that she did not at first notice that she
was holding them upside down STOP The two sisters had been listening to all this with the deepest
interest, and at this juncture the smaller one softly laid her hand on
Clara's arm STOP "Do you know, my dear," she said coaxingly, "my sister and I are in the
very same predicament STOP Quite identically the very same predicament STOP Aren't we, sister? STOP "Quite identically and absolutely the very----" began the fatter sister,
but she was constructing her sentence on too large a scale, and the
little one would not wait for her to finish it STOP "Yes, my dear," she resumed; "we were lunching at the very same shop as
you were--and we had two glasses of lemonade and three sandwiches and
five biscuits--and neither of us has the least idea what we paid STOP Have
we, sister? STOP "Quite identically and absolutely----" murmured the other, who evidently
considered that she was now a whole sentence in arrears, and that she
ought to discharge one obligation before contracting any fresh
liabilities; but the little lady broke in again, and she retired from
the conversation a bankrupt STOP "_Would_ you make it out for us, my dear? STOP pleaded the little old lady STOP "You can do Arithmetic, I trust? STOP her aunt said, a little anxiously, as
Clara turned from one tablet to another, vainly trying to collect her
thoughts STOP Her mind was a blank, and all human expression was rapidly
fading out of her face STOP A gloomy silence ensued STOP KNOT VIII STOP DE OMNIBUS REBUS STOP "This little pig went to market:
   This little pig staid at home. STOP "By Her Radiancy's express command," said the Governor, as he conducted
the travellers, for the last time, from the Imperial presence, "I shall
now have the ecstasy of escorting you as far as the outer gate of the
Military Quarter, where the agony of parting--if indeed Nature can
survive the shock--must be endured STOP From that gate grurmstipths start
every quarter of an hour, both ways----"

"Would you mind repeating that word? STOP said Norman STOP "Grurm----? STOP "Grurmstipths," the Governor repeated STOP "You call them omnibuses in
England STOP They run both ways, and you can travel by one of them all the
way down to the harbour. STOP The old man breathed a sigh of relief; four hours of courtly ceremony
had wearied him, and he had been in constant terror lest something
should call into use the ten thousand additional bamboos STOP In another minute they were crossing a large quadrangle, paved with
marble, and tastefully decorated with a pigsty in each corner STOP Soldiers,
carrying pigs, were marching in all directions: and in the middle stood
a gigantic officer giving orders in a voice of thunder, which made
itself heard above all the uproar of the pigs STOP "It is the Commander-in-Chief! STOP the Governor hurriedly whispered to his
companions, who at once followed his example in prostrating themselves
before the great man STOP The Commander gravely bowed in return STOP He was
covered with gold lace from head to foot: his face wore an expression of
deep misery: and he had a little black pig under each arm STOP Still the
gallant fellow did his best, in the midst of the orders he was every
moment issuing to his men, to bid a courteous farewell to the departing
guests STOP "Farewell, oh old one--carry these three to the South corner--and
farewell to thee, thou young one--put this fat one on the top of the
others in the Western sty--may your shadows never be less--woe is me, it
is wrongly done STOP Empty out all the sties, and begin again! STOP And the
soldier leant upon his sword, and wiped away a tear STOP "He is in distress," the Governor explained as they left the court STOP "Her
Radiancy has commanded him to place twenty-four pigs in those four
sties, so that, as she goes round the court, she may always find the
number in each sty nearer to ten than the number in the last. STOP "Does she call ten nearer to ten than nine is? STOP said Norman STOP "Surely," said the Governor STOP "Her Radiancy would admit that ten is
nearer to ten than nine is--and also nearer than eleven is. STOP "Then I think it can be done," said Norman STOP The Governor shook his head STOP "The Commander has been transferring them
in vain for four months," he said STOP "What hope remains STOP And Her Radiancy
has ordered up ten thousand additional----"

"The pigs don't seem to enjoy being transferred," the old man hastily
interrupted STOP He did not like the subject of bamboos STOP "They are only _provisionally_ transferred, you know," said the
Governor STOP "In most cases they are immediately carried back again: so
they need not mind it STOP And all is done with the greatest care, under the
personal superintendence of the Commander-in-Chief. STOP "Of course she would only go _once_ round? STOP said Norman STOP "Alas, no! STOP sighed their conductor STOP "Round and round STOP Round and round STOP These are Her Radiancy's own words STOP But oh, agony STOP Here is the outer
gate, and we must part! STOP He sobbed as he shook hands with them, and the
next moment was briskly walking away STOP "He _might_ have waited to see us off! STOP said the old man, piteously STOP "And he needn't have begun whistling the very _moment_ he left us! STOP said
the young one, severely STOP "But look sharp--here are two what's-his-names
in the act of starting! STOP Unluckily, the sea-bound omnibus was full STOP "Never mind! STOP said Norman,
cheerily STOP "We'll walk on till the next one overtakes us. STOP They trudged on in silence, both thinking over the military problem,
till they met an omnibus coming from the sea STOP The elder traveller took
out his watch STOP "Just twelve minutes and a half since we started," he
remarked in an absent manner STOP Suddenly the vacant face brightened; the
old man had an idea STOP "My boy! STOP he shouted, bringing his hand down upon
Norman's shoulder so suddenly as for a moment to transfer his centre of
gravity beyond the base of support STOP Thus taken off his guard, the young man wildly staggered forwards, and
seemed about to plunge into space: but in another moment he had
gracefully recovered himself STOP "Problem in Precession and Nutation," he
remarked--in tones where filial respect only just managed to conceal a
shade of annoyance STOP "What is it? STOP he hastily added, fearing his father
might have been taken ill. "Will you have some brandy? STOP "When will the next omnibus overtake us STOP When STOP When? STOP the old man cried,
growing more excited every moment STOP Norman looked gloomy STOP "Give me time," he said STOP "I must think it over. STOP And once more the travellers passed on in silence--a silence only broken
by the distant squeals of the unfortunate little pigs, who were still
being provisionally transferred from sty to sty, under the personal
superintendence of the Commander-in-Chief STOP KNOT IX STOP A SERPENT WITH CORNERS STOP "Water, water, every where,
   Nor any drop to drink. STOP "It'll just take one more pebble. STOP "What ever _are_ you doing with those buckets? STOP The speakers were Hugh and Lambert STOP Place, the beach of Little Mendip STOP Time, 1.30, P.M. Hugh was floating a bucket in another a size larger,
and trying how many pebbles it would carry without sinking STOP Lambert was
lying on his back, doing nothing STOP For the next minute or two Hugh was silent, evidently deep in thought STOP Suddenly he started STOP "I say, look here, Lambert! STOP he cried STOP "If it's alive, and slimy, and with legs, I don't care to," said
Lambert STOP "Didn't Balbus say this morning that, if a body is immersed in liquid,
it displaces as much liquid as is equal to its own bulk? STOP said Hugh STOP "He said things of that sort," Lambert vaguely replied STOP "Well, just look here a minute STOP Here's the little bucket almost quite
immersed: so the water displaced ought to be just about the same bulk STOP And now just look at it! STOP He took out the little bucket as he spoke, and
handed the big one to Lambert STOP "Why, there's hardly a teacupful STOP Do you
mean to say _that_ water is the same bulk as the little bucket? STOP "Course it is," said Lambert STOP "Well, look here again! STOP cried Hugh, triumphantly, as he poured the
water from the big bucket into the little one STOP "Why, it doesn't half
fill it! STOP "That's _its_ business," said Lambert STOP "If Balbus says it's the same
bulk, why, it _is_ the same bulk, you know. STOP "Well, I don't believe it," said Hugh STOP "You needn't," said Lambert STOP "Besides, it's dinner-time STOP Come along. STOP They found Balbus waiting dinner for them, and to him Hugh at once
propounded his difficulty STOP "Let's get you helped first," said Balbus, briskly cutting away at the
joint STOP "You know the old proverb 'Mutton first, mechanics afterwards'? STOP The boys did _not_ know the proverb, but they accepted it in perfect
good faith, as they did every piece of information, however startling,
that came from so infallible an authority as their tutor STOP They ate on
steadily in silence, and, when dinner was over, Hugh set out the usual
array of pens, ink, and paper, while Balbus repeated to them the problem
he had prepared for their afternoon's task STOP "A friend of mine has a flower-garden--a very pretty one, though no
great size--"

"How big is it? STOP said Hugh STOP "That's what _you_ have to find out! STOP Balbus gaily replied STOP "All _I_
tell you is that it is oblong in shape--just half a yard longer than its
width--and that a gravel-walk, one yard wide, begins at one corner and
runs all round it. STOP "Joining into itself? STOP said Hugh STOP "_Not_ joining into itself, young man STOP Just before doing _that_, it
turns a corner, and runs round the garden again, alongside of the first
portion, and then inside that again, winding in and in, and each lap
touching the last one, till it has used up the whole of the area. STOP "Like a serpent with corners? STOP said Lambert STOP "Exactly so STOP And if you walk the whole length of it, to the last inch,
keeping in the centre of the path, it's exactly two miles and half a
furlong STOP Now, while you find out the length and breadth of the garden,
I'll see if I can think out that sea-water puzzle. STOP "You said it was a flower-garden? STOP Hugh inquired, as Balbus was leaving
the room STOP "I did," said Balbus STOP "Where do the flowers grow? STOP said Hugh STOP But Balbus thought it best not
to hear the question STOP He left the boys to their problem, and, in the
silence of his own room, set himself to unravel Hugh's mechanical
paradox STOP "To fix our thoughts," he murmured to himself, as, with hands
deep-buried in his pockets, he paced up and down the room, "we will take
a cylindrical glass jar, with a scale of inches marked up the side, and
fill it with water up to the 10-inch mark: and we will assume that every
inch depth of jar contains a pint of water STOP We will now take a solid
cylinder, such that every inch of it is equal in bulk to _half_ a pint
of water, and plunge 4 inches of it into the water, so that the end of
the cylinder comes down to the 6-inch mark STOP Well, that displaces 2
pints of water STOP What becomes of them STOP Why, if there were no more
cylinder, they would lie comfortably on the top, and fill the jar up to
the 12-inch mark STOP But unfortunately there _is_ more cylinder, occupying
half the space between the 10-inch and the 12-inch marks, so that only
_one_ pint of water can be accommodated there STOP What becomes of the other
pint STOP Why, if there were no more cylinder, it would lie on the top, and
fill the jar up to the 13-inch mark STOP But unfortunately----Shade of
Newton! STOP he exclaimed, in sudden accents of terror STOP "When _does_ the
water stop rising? STOP A bright idea struck him STOP "I'll write a little essay on it," he said STOP _Balbus's Essay._

"When a solid is immersed in a liquid, it is well known that it
displaces a portion of the liquid equal to itself in bulk, and that the
level of the liquid rises just so much as it would rise if a quantity of
liquid had been added to it, equal in bulk to the solid STOP Lardner says,
precisely the same process occurs when a solid is _partially_ immersed:
the quantity of liquid displaced, in this case, equalling the portion of
the solid which is immersed, and the rise of the level being in
proportion STOP "Suppose a solid held above the surface of a liquid and partially
immersed: a portion of the liquid is displaced, and the level of the
liquid rises STOP But, by this rise of level, a little bit more of the solid
is of course immersed, and so there is a new displacement of a second
portion of the liquid, and a consequent rise of level STOP Again, this
second rise of level causes a yet further immersion, and by consequence
another displacement of liquid and another rise STOP It is self-evident that
this process must continue till the entire solid is immersed, and that
the liquid will then begin to immerse whatever holds the solid, which,
being connected with it, must for the time be considered a part of it STOP If you hold a stick, six feet long, with its end in a tumbler of water,
and wait long enough, you must eventually be immersed STOP The question as
to the source from which the water is supplied--which belongs to a high
branch of mathematics, and is therefore beyond our present scope--does
not apply to the sea STOP Let us therefore take the familiar instance of a
man standing at the edge of the sea, at ebb-tide, with a solid in his
hand, which he partially immerses: he remains steadfast and unmoved, and
we all know that he must be drowned STOP The multitudes who daily perish in
this manner to attest a philosophical truth, and whose bodies the
unreasoning wave casts sullenly upon our thankless shores, have a truer
claim to be called the martyrs of science than a Galileo or a Kepler STOP To
use Kossuth's eloquent phrase, they are the unnamed demigods of the
nineteenth century STOP "[B]

                                   

"There's a fallacy _somewhere_," he murmured drowsily, as he stretched
his long legs upon the sofa STOP "I must think it over again. STOP He closed his
eyes, in order to concentrate his attention more perfectly, and for the
next hour or so his slow and regular breathing bore witness to the
careful deliberation with which he was investigating this new and
perplexing view of the subject STOP [Illustration: "HE REMAINS STEADFAST AND UNMOVED." STOP FOOTNOTE:

CHELSEA BUNS STOP "Yea, buns, and buns, and buns! STOP OLD SONG STOP "How very, very sad! STOP exclaimed Clara; and the eyes of the gentle girl
filled with tears as she spoke STOP "Sad--but very curious when you come to look at it arithmetically," was
her aunt's less romantic reply STOP "Some of them have lost an arm in their
country's service, some a leg, some an ear, some an eye----"

"And some, perhaps, _all_! STOP Clara murmured dreamily, as they passed the
long rows of weather-beaten heroes basking in the sun STOP "Did you notice
that very old one, with a red face, who was drawing a map in the dust
with his wooden leg, and all the others watching STOP I _think_ it was a
plan of a battle----"

"The battle of Trafalgar, no doubt," her aunt interrupted, briskly STOP "Hardly that, I think," Clara ventured to say STOP "You see, in that case,
he couldn't well be alive----"

"Couldn't well be alive! STOP the old lady contemptuously repeated STOP "He's as
lively as you and me put together STOP Why, if drawing a map in the
dust--with one's wooden leg--doesn't prove one to be alive, perhaps
you'll kindly mention what _does_ prove it! STOP Clara did not see her way out of it STOP Logic had never been her _forte_ STOP "To return to the arithmetic," Mad Mathesis resumed--the eccentric old
lady never let slip an opportunity of driving her niece into a
calculation--"what percentage do you suppose must have lost all four--a
leg, an arm, an eye, and an ear? STOP "How _can_ I tell? STOP gasped the terrified girl STOP She knew well what was
coming STOP "You can't, of course, without _data_," her aunt replied: "but I'm just
going to give you----"

"Give her a Chelsea bun, Miss STOP That's what most young ladies likes
best! STOP The voice was rich and musical, and the speaker dexterously
whipped back the snowy cloth that covered his basket, and disclosed a
tempting array of the familiar square buns, joined together in rows,
richly egged and browned, and glistening in the sun STOP "No, sir STOP I shall give her nothing so indigestible STOP Be off! STOP The old
lady waved her parasol threateningly: but nothing seemed to disturb the
good-humour of the jolly old man, who marched on, chanting his melodious
refrain:--

[Music: Chel-sea buns STOP Chel-sea buns hot STOP Chel-sea buns STOP Pi-ping hot STOP Chel-sea buns hot STOP Chel-sea buns! STOP "Far too indigestible, my love! STOP said the old lady STOP "Percentages will
agree with you ever so much better! STOP Clara sighed, and there was a hungry look in her eyes as she watched the
basket lessening in the distance: but she meekly listened to the
relentless old lady, who at once proceeded to count off the _data_ on
her fingers STOP "Say that 70 per cent STOP have lost an eye--75 per cent STOP an ear--80 per
cent STOP an arm--85 per cent STOP a leg--that'll do it beautifully STOP Now, my
dear, what percentage, _at least_, must have lost all four? STOP No more conversation occurred--unless a smothered exclamation of "Piping
hot! STOP which escaped from Clara's lips as the basket vanished round a
corner could be counted as such--until they reached the old Chelsea
mansion, where Clara's father was then staying, with his three sons and
their old tutor STOP Balbus, Lambert, and Hugh had entered the house only a few minutes
before them STOP They had been out walking, and Hugh had been propounding a
difficulty which had reduced Lambert to the depths of gloom, and had
even puzzled Balbus STOP "It changes from Wednesday to Thursday at midnight, doesn't it? STOP Hugh
had begun STOP "Sometimes," said Balbus, cautiously STOP "Always," said Lambert, decisively STOP "_Sometimes_," Balbus gently insisted STOP "Six midnights out of seven, it
changes to some other name. STOP "I meant, of course," Hugh corrected himself, "when it _does_ change
from Wednesday to Thursday, it does it at midnight--and _only_ at
midnight. STOP "Surely," said Balbus STOP Lambert was silent STOP "Well, now, suppose it's midnight here in Chelsea STOP Then it's Wednesday
_west_ of Chelsea (say in Ireland or America) where midnight hasn't
arrived yet: and it's Thursday _east_ of Chelsea (say in Germany or
Russia) where midnight has just passed by? STOP "Surely," Balbus said again STOP Even Lambert nodded this time STOP "But it isn't midnight, anywhere else; so it can't be changing from one
day to another anywhere else STOP And yet, if Ireland and America and so on
call it Wednesday, and Germany and Russia and so on call it Thursday,
there _must_ be some place--not Chelsea--that has different days on the
two sides of it STOP And the worst of it is, the people _there_ get their
days in the wrong order: they've got Wednesday _east_ of them, and
Thursday _west_--just as if their day had changed from Thursday to
Wednesday! STOP "I've heard that puzzle before! STOP cried Lambert STOP "And I'll tell you the
explanation STOP When a ship goes round the world from east to west, we
know that it loses a day in its reckoning: so that when it gets home,
and calls its day Wednesday, it finds people here calling it Thursday,
because we've had one more midnight than the ship has had STOP And when you
go the other way round you gain a day. STOP "I know all that," said Hugh, in reply to this not very lucid
explanation: "but it doesn't help me, because the ship hasn't proper
days STOP One way round, you get more than twenty-four hours to the day, and
the other way you get less: so of course the names get wrong: but people
that live on in one place always get twenty-four hours to the day. STOP "I suppose there _is_ such a place," Balbus said, meditatively, "though
I never heard of it STOP And the people must find it very queer, as Hugh
says, to have the old day _east_ of them, and the new one _west_:
because, when midnight comes round to them, with the new day in front of
it and the old one behind it, one doesn't see exactly what happens STOP I
must think it over. STOP So they had entered the house in the state I have described--Balbus
puzzled, and Lambert buried in gloomy thought STOP "Yes, m'm, Master _is_ at home, m'm," said the stately old butler STOP (N.B.--It is only a butler of experience who can manage a series of
three M's together, without any interjacent vowels. STOP "And the _ole_
party is a-waiting for you in the libery. STOP "I don't like his calling your father an _old_ party," Mad Mathesis
whispered to her niece, as they crossed the hall STOP And Clara had only
just time to whisper in reply "he meant the _whole_ party," before they
were ushered into the library, and the sight of the five solemn faces
there assembled chilled her into silence STOP Her father sat at the head of the table, and mutely signed to the ladies
to take the two vacant chairs, one on each side of him STOP His three sons
and Balbus completed the party STOP Writing materials had been arranged
round the table, after the fashion of a ghostly banquet: the butler had
evidently bestowed much thought on the grim device STOP Sheets of quarto
paper, each flanked by a pen on one side and a pencil on the other,
represented the plates--penwipers did duty for rolls of bread--while
ink-bottles stood in the places usually occupied by wine-glasses STOP The
_piece de resistance_ was a large green baize bag, which gave forth, as
the old man restlessly lifted it from side to side, a charming jingle,
as of innumerable golden guineas STOP "Sister, daughter, sons--and Balbus--," the old man began, so nervously,
that Balbus put in a gentle "Hear, hear! STOP while Hugh drummed on the
table with his fists STOP This disconcerted the unpractised orator STOP "Sister--" he began again, then paused a moment, moved the bag to the
other side, and went on with a rush, "I mean--this being--a critical
occasion--more or less--being the year when one of my sons comes of
age--" he paused again in some confusion, having evidently got into the
middle of his speech sooner than he intended: but it was too late to go
back STOP "Hear, hear! STOP cried Balbus STOP "Quite so," said the old gentleman,
recovering his self-possession a little: "when first I began this annual
custom--my friend Balbus will correct me if I am wrong--" (Hugh
whispered "with a strap! STOP but nobody heard him except Lambert, who only
frowned and shook his head at him) "--this annual custom of giving each
of my sons as many guineas as would represent his age--it was a critical
time--so Balbus informed me--as the ages of two of you were together
equal to that of the third--so on that occasion I made a speech----" He
paused so long that Balbus thought it well to come to the rescue with
the words "It was a most----" but the old man checked him with a warning
look: "yes, made a speech," he repeated STOP "A few years after that, Balbus
pointed out--I say pointed out--" ("Hear, hear" STOP cried Balbus STOP "Quite
so," said the grateful old man. STOP "--that it was _another_ critical
occasion STOP The ages of two of you were together _double_ that of the
third STOP So I made another speech--another speech STOP And now again it's a
critical occasion--so Balbus says--and I am making----" (Here Mad
Mathesis pointedly referred to her watch) "all the haste I can! STOP the old
man cried, with wonderful presence of mind STOP "Indeed, sister, I'm coming
to the point now STOP The number of years that have passed since that first
occasion is just two-thirds of the number of guineas I then gave you STOP Now, my boys, calculate your ages from the _data_, and you shall have
the money! STOP "But we _know_ our ages! STOP cried Hugh STOP "Silence, sir! STOP thundered the old man, rising to his full height (he was
exactly five-foot five) in his indignation STOP "I say you must use the
_data_ only STOP You mustn't even assume _which_ it is that comes of age! STOP He clutched the bag as he spoke, and with tottering steps (it was about
as much as he could do to carry it) he left the room STOP "And _you_ shall have a similar _cadeau_," the old lady whispered to her
niece, "when you've calculated that percentage! STOP And she followed her
brother STOP Nothing could exceed the solemnity with which the old couple had risen
from the table, and yet was it--was it a _grin_ with which the father
turned away from his unhappy sons STOP Could it be--could it be a _wink_
with which the aunt abandoned her despairing niece STOP And were those--were
those sounds of suppressed _chuckling_ which floated into the room, just
before Balbus (who had followed them out) closed the door STOP Surely not:
and yet the butler told the cook--but no, that was merely idle gossip,
and I will not repeat it STOP The shades of evening granted their unuttered petition, and "closed not
o'er" them (for the butler brought in the lamp): the same obliging
shades left them a "lonely bark" (the wail of a dog, in the back-yard,
baying the moon) for "awhile": but neither "morn, alas," (nor any other
epoch) seemed likely to "restore" them--to that peace of mind which had
once been theirs ere ever these problems had swooped upon them, and
crushed them with a load of unfathomable mystery STOP "It's hardly fair," muttered Hugh, "to give us such a jumble as this to
work out! STOP "Fair? STOP Clara echoed, bitterly STOP "Well! STOP And to all my readers I can but repeat the last words of gentle Clara--

   FARE-WELL STOP APPENDIX STOP "A knot! STOP said Alice STOP "Oh, do let me help to undo it! STOP ANSWERS TO KNOT I STOP _Problem._--"Two travellers spend from 3 o'clock till 9 in walking along
a level road, up a hill, and home again: their pace on the level being 4
miles an hour, up hill 3, and down hill 6 STOP Find distance walked: also
(within half an hour) time of reaching top of hill. STOP _Answer._--"24 miles: half-past 6. STOP _Solution._--A level mile takes 1/4 of an hour, up hill 1/3, down hill
1/6 STOP Hence to go and return over the same mile, whether on the level or
on the hill-side, takes 1/2 an hour STOP Hence in 6 hours they went 12 miles
out and 12 back STOP If the 12 miles out had been nearly all level, they
would have taken a little over 3 hours; if nearly all up hill, a little
under 4 STOP Hence 3-1/2 hours must be within 1/2 an hour of the time taken
in reaching the peak; thus, as they started at 3, they got there within
1/2 an hour of 1/2 past 6 STOP Twenty-seven answers have come in STOP Of these, 9 are right, 16 partially
right, and 2 wrong STOP The 16 give the _distance_ correctly, but they have
failed to grasp the fact that the top of the hill might have been
reached at _any_ moment between 6 o'clock and 7 STOP The two wrong answers are from GERTY VERNON and A NIHILIST STOP The former
makes the distance "23 miles," while her revolutionary companion puts it
at "27. STOP GERTY VERNON says "they had to go 4 miles along the plain, and
got to the foot of the hill at 4 o'clock. STOP They _might_ have done so, I
grant; but you have no ground for saying they _did_ so STOP "It was 7-1/2
miles to the top of the hill, and they reached that at 1/4 before 7
o'clock. STOP Here you go wrong in your arithmetic, and I must, however
reluctantly, bid you farewell STOP 7-1/2 miles, at 3 miles an hour, would
_not_ require 2-3/4 hours STOP A NIHILIST says "Let _x_ denote the whole
number of miles; _y_ the number of hours to hill-top; [ therefore] 3_y_ =
number of miles to hill-top, and _x_-3_y_ = number of miles on the other
side. STOP You bewilder me STOP The other side of _what_ STOP "Of the hill," you
say STOP But then, how did they get home again STOP However, to accommodate your
views we will build a new hostelry at the foot of the hill on the
opposite side, and also assume (what I grant you is _possible_, though
it is not _necessarily_ true) that there was no level road at all STOP Even
then you go wrong STOP You say

   "_y_ = 6 - (_x_ - 3_y_)/6, ..... (i);

   _x_/4-1/2 = 6              .... STOP (ii). STOP I grant you (i), but I deny (ii): it rests on the assumption that to go
_part_ of the time at 3 miles an hour, and the rest at 6 miles an hour,
comes to the same result as going the _whole_ time at 4-1/2 miles an
hour STOP But this would only be true if the "_part_" were an exact _half_,
i.e., if they went up hill for 3 hours, and down hill for the other 3:
which they certainly did _not_ do STOP The sixteen, who are partially right, are AGNES BAILEY, F. K., FIFEE, G.
E. B., H. P., KIT, M. E. T., MYSIE, A MOTHER'S SON, NAIRAM, A
REDRUTHIAN, A SOCIALIST, SPEAR MAIDEN, T. B STOP C, VIS INERTIAE, and YAK STOP Of
these, F. K., FIFEE, T. B STOP C, and VIS INERTIAE do not attempt the second
part at all STOP F. K. and H. P. give no working STOP The rest make particular
assumptions, such as that there was no level road--that there were 6
miles of level road--and so on, all leading to _particular_ times being
fixed for reaching the hill-top STOP The most curious assumption is that of
AGNES BAILEY, who says "Let _x_ = number of hours occupied in ascent;
then _x_/2 = hours occupied in descent; and 4_x_/3 = hours occupied on
the level. STOP I suppose you were thinking of the relative _rates_, up
hill and on the level; which we might express by saying that, if they
went x miles up hill in a certain time, they would go 4_x_/3 miles on
the level _in the same time_ STOP You have, in fact, assumed that they took
_the same time_ on the level that they took in ascending the hill STOP FIFEE
assumes that, when the aged knight said they had gone "four miles in the
hour" on the level, he meant that four miles was the _distance_ gone,

trains went at the rate of 2 units a minute and at intervals of 30
units; the other at the rate of 3 units a minute and at intervals of 45
units STOP An easterly train starting has 45 units between it and the first
train it will meet: it does 2-5ths of this while the other does 3-5ths,
and thus meets it at the end of 18 units, and so all the way round STOP A
westerly train starting has 30 units between it and the first train it
will meet: it does 3-5ths of this while the other does 2-5ths, and thus
meets it at the end of 18 units, and so all the way round STOP Hence if the

started during the 3 hours of her trip, as well as all which started
during the previous 2 hours, _i.e._, all which started at the
commencements of 20 periods of 15 minutes each; and she is right in
striking out the one she met at the moment of starting; but wrong in
striking out the _last_ train, for she did not meet this at the
terminus, but 15 minutes before she got there STOP She makes the same
mistake in (2) STOP FINANCIER thinks that any train, met for the second
time, is not to be counted STOP I. W. T. finds, by a process which is not

met STOP CHESHIRE CAT and OLD MAID get "20" as answer for (1), by forgetting
to strike out the train met on arrival STOP The others all get "18" in
various ways STOP BOG-OAK, GUY, and R. W. divide the trains which the
westerly traveller has to meet into 2 sets, viz., those already on the
line, which they (rightly) make "11," and those which started during her
2 hours' journey (exclusive of train met on arrival), which they
(wrongly) make "7"; and they make a similar mistake with the easterly
train STOP BRIDGET (rightly) says that the westerly traveller met a train
every 6 minutes for 2 hours, but (wrongly) makes the number "20"; it
should be "21. STOP G. E. B. adopts BO-PEEP'S method, but (wrongly) strikes
out (for the easterly traveller) the train which started at the
_commencement_ of the previous 2 hours STOP MARY thinks a train, met on

makes them borrow "0" and steal "0," and uses both cyphers by putting
them at the right-hand end of the 1,000_l._, thus producing 100,000_l._,

INFRACTA has solved it even more ingeniously: with the first cypher she
turns the "1" of the 1,000_l._ into a "9," and adds the result to the
original sum, thus getting 10,000_l._: and in this, by means of the
other "0," she turns the "1" into a "6," thus hitting the exact

warm as 3 of _M_'s STOP Which is best, giving equal weight in the result to
rapidity of work, lightness, and warmth STOP _Answer._--The order is _M_, _L_, _Z_ STOP _Solution._--As to rapidity (other things being constant) _L_'s merit is
to _M_'s in the ratio of 5 to 2: _Z_'s to _L_'s in the ratio of 4 to 3 STOP In order to get one set of 3 numbers fulfilling these conditions, it is
perhaps simplest to take the one that occurs _twice_ as unity, and
reduce the others to fractions: this gives, for _L_, _M_, and _Z_, the
marks 1, 2/5, 4/3 STOP In estimating for _lightness_, we observe that the
greater the weight, the less the merit, so that _Z_'s merit is to _L_'s
as 5 to 1 STOP Thus the marks for _lightness_ are 1/5, 5/3, 1 STOP And
similarly, the marks for warmth are 3, 1, 1/4 STOP To get the total result,
we must _multiply_ _L_'s 3 marks together, and do the same for _M_ and
for _Z_ STOP The final numbers are 1 x 1/5 x 3, 2/5 x 5/3 x 1, 4/3 x 1 x

twenty-four wrong STOP These hapless ones have all (with three exceptions)
fallen into the error of _adding_ the proportional numbers together, for
each candidate, instead of _multiplying_ STOP _Why_ the latter is right,
rather than the former, is fully proved in text-books, so I will not
occupy space by stating it here: but it can be _illustrated_ very easily
by the case of length, breadth, and depth STOP Suppose _A_ and _B_ are rival
diggers of rectangular tanks: the amount of work done is evidently
measured by the number of _cubical feet_ dug out STOP Let _A_ dig a tank 10

deep STOP The cubical contents are 200, 300; _i.e._ _B_ is best digger in
the ratio of 3 to 2 STOP Now try marking for length, width, and depth,
separately; giving a maximum mark of 10 to the best in each contest, and
then _adding_ the results STOP Of the twenty-four malefactors, one gives no working, and so has no real
claim to be named; but I break the rule for once, in deference to its

not fallen into the common error; she _multiplies_ together the
proportionate numbers she gets, but in getting them she goes wrong, by
reckoning warmth as a _de_-merit STOP Possibly she is "Freshly Burnt," or
comes "From Bombay. STOP JANET and MRS. SAIREY GAMP have also avoided this
error: the method they have adopted is shrouded in mystery--I scarcely
feel competent to criticize it STOP MRS. GAMP says "if Zuzu makes 4 while
Lolo makes 3, Zuzu makes 6 while Lolo makes 5 (bad reasoning), while
Mimi makes 2. STOP From this she concludes "therefore Zuzu excels in speed
by 1" (_i.e._ when compared with Lolo; but what about Mimi?) STOP She then
compares the 3 kinds of excellence, measured on this mystic scale STOP JANET
takes the statement, that "Lolo makes 5 while Mimi makes 2," to prove
that "Lolo makes 3 while Mimi makes 1 and Zuzu 4" (worse reasoning than
MRS. GAMP'S), and thence concludes that "Zuzu excels in speed by 1/8" STOP JANET should have been ADELINE, "mystery of mysteries! STOP The fourth set actually put Mimi at the top, arranging them as "Mimi,

others who, like her, understood the condition to be that _every_ marked
picture must have _three_ marks, my sincere regret that the unfortunate
phrase "_fill_ the columns with oughts and crosses" should have caused
them to waste so much time and trouble STOP I can only repeat that a
_literal_ interpretation of "fill" would seem to _me_ to require that
_every_ picture in the gallery should be marked STOP VIS INERTIAE would have
been in the First Class if she had sent in the solution she now offers STOP ANSWERS TO KNOT VII STOP _Problem._--Given that one glass of lemonade, 3 sandwiches, and 7
biscuits, cost 1_s._ 2_d._; and that one glass of lemonade, 4
sandwiches, and 10 biscuits, cost 1_s._ 5_d._: find the cost of (1) a
glass of lemonade, a sandwich, and a biscuit; and (2) 2 glasses of
lemonade, 3 sandwiches, and 5 biscuits STOP _Answer._--(1) 8_d._; (2) 1_s._ 7_d._

_Solution._--This is best treated algebraically STOP Let _x_ = the cost (in
pence) of a glass of lemonade, _y_ of a sandwich, and _z_ of a biscuit STOP Then we have _x_ + 3_y_ + 7_z_ = 14, and _x_ + 4_y_ + 10_z_ = 17 STOP And we
require the values of _x_ + _y_ + _z_, and of 2_x_ + 3_y_ + 5_z_ STOP Now,
from _two_ equations only, we cannot find, _separately_, the values of
_three_ unknowns: certain _combinations_ of them may, however, be found STOP Also we know that we can, by the help of the given equations, eliminate
2 of the 3 unknowns from the quantity whose value is required, which
will then contain one only STOP If, then, the required value is
ascertainable at all, it can only be by the 3rd unknown vanishing of
itself: otherwise the problem is impossible STOP Let us then eliminate lemonade and sandwiches, and reduce everything to
biscuits--a state of things even more depressing than "if all the world
were apple-pie"--by subtracting the 1st equation from the 2nd, which
eliminates lemonade, and gives _y_ + 3_z_ = 3, or _y_ = 3-3_z_; and then
substituting this value of _y_ in the 1st, which gives _x_-2_z_ = 5,
_i.e._ _x_ = 5 + 2_z_ STOP Now if we substitute these values of _x_, _y_, in
the quantities whose values are required, the first becomes (5 + 2_z_) +
(3-3_z_) + _z_, _i.e._ 8: and the second becomes 2(5 + 2_z_) + 3(3-3_z_)
+ 5_z_, _i.e._ 19 STOP Hence the answers are (1) 8_d._, (2) 1_s._ 7_d._

                                   

The above is a _universal_ method: that is, it is absolutely certain
either to produce the answer, or to prove that no answer is possible STOP The question may also be solved by combining the quantities whose values
are given, so as to form those whose values are required STOP This is merely
a matter of ingenuity and good luck: and as it _may_ fail, even when the
thing is possible, and is of no use in proving it _im_possible, I cannot
rank this method as equal in value with the other STOP Even when it
succeeds, it may prove a very tedious process STOP Suppose the 26
competitors, who have sent in what I may call _accidental_ solutions,
had had a question to deal with where every number contained 8 or 10
digits STOP I suspect it would have been a case of "silvered is the raven
hair" (see "Patience") before any solution would have been hit on by
the most ingenious of them STOP Forty-five answers have come in, of which 44 give, I am happy to say,
some sort of _working_, and therefore deserve to be mentioned by name,
and to have their virtues, or vices as the case may be, discussed STOP Thirteen have made assumptions to which they have no right, and so
cannot figure in the Class-list, even though, in 10 of the 13 cases, the
answer is right STOP Of the remaining 28, no less than 26 have sent in
_accidental_ solutions, and therefore fall short of the highest honours STOP I will now discuss individual cases, taking the worst first, as my
custom is STOP FROGGY gives no working--at least this is all he gives: after stating
the given equations, he says "therefore the difference, 1 sandwich + 3
biscuits, = 3_d._": then follow the amounts of the unknown bills, with
no further hint as to how he got them STOP FROGGY has had a _very_ narrow
escape of not being named at all STOP Of those who are wrong, VIS INERTIAE has sent in a piece of incorrect
working STOP Peruse the horrid details, and shudder STOP She takes _x_ (call it
"_y_") as the cost of a sandwich, and concludes (rightly enough) that a
biscuit will cost (3-_y_)/3 STOP She then subtracts the second equation from
the first, and deduces 3_y_ + 7 x (3-_y_)/3-4_y_ + 10 x (3-_y_)/3 = 3 STOP By making two mistakes in this line, she brings out _y_ = 3/2 STOP Try it
again, oh VIS INERTIAE STOP Away with INERTIAE: infuse a little more VIS: and
you will bring out the correct (though uninteresting) result, 0 = 0 STOP This will show you that it is hopeless to try to coax any one of these 3
unknowns to reveal its _separate_ value STOP The other competitor, who is
wrong throughout, is either J. M. C. or T. M. C.: but, whether he be a
Juvenile Mis-Calculator or a True Mathematician Confused, he makes the
answers 7_d._ and 1_s._ 5_d._ He assumes, with Too Much Confidence, that
biscuits were 1/2_d._ each, and that Clara paid for 8, though she only
ate 7 STOP We will now consider the 13 whose working is wrong, though the answer is
right: and, not to measure their demerits too exactly, I will take them
in alphabetical order STOP ANITA finds (rightly) that "1 sandwich and 3
biscuits cost 3_d._," and proceeds "therefore 1 sandwich = 1-1/2_d._, 3
biscuits = 1-1/2_d._, 1 lemonade = 6_d._" DINAH MITE begins like ANITA:
and thence proves (rightly) that a biscuit costs less than a 1_d._:
whence she concludes (wrongly) that it _must_ cost 1/2_d._ F. C. W. is
so beautifully resigned to the certainty of a verdict of "guilty," that
I have hardly the heart to utter the word, without adding a "recommended
to mercy owing to extenuating circumstances. STOP But really, you know,
where _are_ the extenuating circumstances STOP She begins by assuming that
lemonade is 4_d._ a glass, and sandwiches 3_d._ each, (making with the 2
given equations, _four_ conditions to be fulfilled by _three_ miserable
unknowns!) STOP And, having (naturally) developed this into a contradiction,
she then tries 5_d._ and 2_d._ with a similar result STOP (N.B STOP _This_
process might have been carried on through the whole of the Tertiary
Period, without gratifying one single Megatherium. STOP She then, by a
"happy thought," tries half-penny biscuits, and so obtains a consistent
result STOP This may be a good solution, viewing the problem as a conundrum:
but it is _not_ scientific STOP JANET identifies sandwiches with biscuits STOP "One sandwich + 3 biscuits" she makes equal to "4. STOP Four _what_ STOP MAYFAIR
makes the astounding assertion that the equation, _s_ + 3_b_ = 3, "is
evidently only satisfied by _s_ = 3/2, _b_ = 1/2" STOP OLD CAT believes that
the assumption that a sandwich costs 1-1/2_d._ is "the only way to avoid
unmanageable fractions. STOP But _why_ avoid them STOP Is there not a certain
glow of triumph in taming such a fraction STOP "Ladies and gentlemen, the
fraction now before you is one that for years defied all efforts of a
refining nature: it was, in a word, hopelessly vulgar STOP Treating it as a
circulating decimal (the treadmill of fractions) only made matters
worse STOP As a last resource, I reduced it to its lowest terms, and
extracted its square root! STOP Joking apart, let me thank OLD CAT for some
very kind words of sympathy, in reference to a correspondent (whose name
I am happy to say I have now forgotten) who had found fault with me as a
discourteous critic STOP O. V. L. is beyond my comprehension STOP He takes the
given equations as (1) and (2): thence, by the process [(2)-(1)] deduces
(rightly) equation (3) viz STOP _s_ + 3_b_ = 3: and thence again, by the
process [x3] (a hopeless mystery), deduces 3_s_ + 4_b_ = 4 STOP I have
nothing to say about it: I give it up STOP SEA-BREEZE says "it is immaterial
to the answer" (why? STOP "in what proportion 3_d._ is divided between the
sandwich and the 3 biscuits": so she assumes _s_ = l-1/2_d._, _b_ =
1/2_d._ STANZA is one of a very irregular metre STOP At first she (like
JANET) identifies sandwiches with biscuits STOP She then tries two
assumptions (_s_ = 1, _b_ = 2/3, and _s_ = 1/2 _b_ = 5/6), and
(naturally) ends in contradictions STOP Then she returns to the first
assumption, and finds the 3 unknowns separately: _quod est absurdum_ STOP STILETTO identifies sandwiches and biscuits, as "articles. STOP Is the word
ever used by confectioners STOP I fancied "What is the next article, Ma'am? STOP was limited to linendrapers STOP TWO SISTERS first assume that biscuits are
4 a penny, and then that they are 2 a penny, adding that "the answer
will of course be the same in both cases. STOP It is a dreamy remark,
making one feel something like Macbeth grasping at the spectral dagger STOP "Is this a statement that I see before me? STOP If you were to say "we both

please? STOP and OLD CROW, who send a joint answer, and Y. Y., adopt the

friendly remarks) that entrance-fees and subscriptions are things

of steps they have taken between the _data_ and the answers STOP In order
to do them full justice I have arranged the 2nd class in sections,
according to the number of steps STOP The two Kings are fearfully
deliberate STOP I suppose walking quick, or taking short cuts, is
inconsistent with kingly dignity: but really, in reading THESEUS'

altered "Coal" into "Cole. STOP King Coilus, or Coil, seems to have reigned

   Marius ys sone was kyng, quoynte mon & bold STOP And ys sone was aftur hym, _Coil_ was ys name,
   Bothe it were quoynte men, & of noble fame. STOP BALBUS lays it down as a general principle that "in order to ascertain
the cost of any one luncheon, it must come to the same amount upon two
different assumptions. STOP (_Query._ Should not "it" be "we" STOP Otherwise the
_luncheon_ is represented as wishing to ascertain its own cost! STOP He then
makes two assumptions--one, that sandwiches cost nothing; the other,
that biscuits cost nothing, (either arrangement would lead to the shop
being inconveniently crowded! STOP --and brings out the unknown luncheons as
8_d._ and 19_d._, on each assumption STOP He then concludes that this
agreement of results "shows that the answers are correct. STOP Now I propose
to disprove his general law by simply giving _one_ instance of its
failing STOP One instance is quite enough STOP In logical language, in order to
disprove a "universal affirmative," it is enough to prove its
contradictory, which is a "particular negative. STOP (I must pause for a
digression on Logic, and especially on Ladies' Logic STOP The universal
affirmative "everybody says he's a duck" is crushed instantly by proving
the particular negative "Peter says he's a goose," which is equivalent
to "Peter does _not_ say he's a duck. STOP And the universal negative
"nobody calls on her" is well met by the particular affirmative "_I_
called yesterday. STOP In short, either of two contradictories disproves the
other: and the moral is that, since a particular proposition is much
more easily proved than a universal one, it is the wisest course, in
arguing with a Lady, to limit one's _own_ assertions to "particulars,"
and leave _her_ to prove the "universal" contradictory, if she can STOP You
will thus generally secure a _logical_ victory: a _practical_ victory is
not to be hoped for, since she can always fall back upon the crushing
remark "_that_ has nothing to do with it! STOP --a move for which Man has not
yet discovered any satisfactory answer STOP Now let us return to BALBUS. STOP Here is my "particular negative," on which to test his rule STOP Suppose the
two recorded luncheons to have been "2 buns, one queen-cake, 2
sausage-rolls, and a bottle of Zoedone: total, one-and-ninepence," and
"one bun, 2 queen-cakes, a sausage-roll, and a bottle of Zoedone: total,
one-and-fourpence. STOP And suppose Clara's unknown luncheon to have been "3
buns, one queen-cake, one sausage-roll, and 2 bottles of Zoedone:" while
the two little sisters had been indulging in "8 buns, 4 queen-cakes, 2
sausage-rolls, and 6 bottles of Zoedone. STOP (Poor souls, how thirsty they
must have been! STOP If BALBUS will kindly try this by his principle of "two
assumptions," first assuming that a bun is 1_d._ and a queen-cake 2_d._,
and then that a bun is 3_d._ and a queen-cake 3_d._, he will bring out
the other two luncheons, on each assumption, as "one-and-nine-pence" and
"four-and-ten-pence" respectively, which harmony of results, he will
say, "shows that the answers are correct. STOP And yet, as a matter of fact,
the buns were 2_d._ each, the queen-cakes 3_d._, the sausage-rolls
6_d._, and the Zoedone 2_d._ a bottle: so that Clara's third luncheon
had cost one-and-sevenpence, and her thirsty friends had spent
four-and-fourpence STOP Another remark of BALBUS I will quote and discuss: for I think that it
also may yield a moral for some of my readers STOP He says "it is the same
thing in substance whether in solving this problem we use words and call
it Arithmetic, or use letters and signs and call it Algebra. STOP Now this
does not appear to me a correct description of the two methods: the
Arithmetical method is that of "synthesis" only; it goes from one known
fact to another, till it reaches its goal: whereas the Algebraical
method is that of "analysis": it begins with the goal, symbolically
represented, and so goes backwards, dragging its veiled victim with it,
till it has reached the full daylight of known facts, in which it can
tear off the veil and say "I know you! STOP Take an illustration STOP Your house has been broken into and robbed, and

surely the other is the more natural assumption STOP In Knot VI., the first Problem was of course a mere _jeu de mots_, whose

Three, whose essential feature is that the result depends on the
variation of several elements, which are so related to it that, if all
but one be constant, it varies as that one: hence, if none be constant,
it varies as their product STOP Thus, for example, the cubical contents of a
rectangular tank vary as its length, if breadth and depth be constant,
and so on; hence, if none be constant, it varies as the product of the
length, breadth, and depth STOP When the result is not thus connected with the varying elements, the
Problem ceases to be Double Rule of Three and often becomes one of great
complexity STOP To illustrate this, let us take two candidates for a prize, _A_ and _B_,
who are to compete in French, German, and Italian:

(_a_) Let it be laid down that the result is to depend on their
_relative_ knowledge of each subject, so that, whether their marks, for
French, be "1, 2" or "100, 200," the result will be the same: and let it
also be laid down that, if they get equal marks on 2 papers, the final
marks are to have the same ratio as those of the 3rd paper STOP This is a
case of ordinary Double Rule of Three STOP We multiply _A_'s 3 marks
together, and do the same for _B_ STOP Note that, if _A_ gets a single "0,"
his final mark is "0," even if he gets full marks for 2 papers while _B_
gets only one mark for each paper STOP This of course would be very unfair
on _A_, though a correct solution under the given conditions STOP (_b_) The result is to depend, as before, on _relative_ knowledge; but
French is to have twice as much weight as German or Italian STOP This is an
unusual form of question STOP I should be inclined to say "the resulting
ratio is to be nearer to the French ratio than if we multiplied as in
(_a_), and so much nearer that it would be necessary to use the other
multipliers _twice_ to produce the same result as in (_a_):" _e.g._ if
the French Ratio were 9/10, and the others 4/9, 1/9 so that the ultimate
ratio, by method (_a_), would be 2/45, I should multiply instead by 2/3,
1/3, giving the result, 1/3 which is nearer to 9/10 than if he had used
method (_a_) STOP (_c_) The result is to depend on _actual_ amount of knowledge of the 3
subjects collectively STOP Here we have to ask two questions STOP (1) What is
to be the "unit" (_i.e._ "standard to measure by") in each subject STOP (2)
Are these units to be of equal, or unequal value STOP The usual "unit" is
the knowledge shown by answering the whole paper correctly; calling this
"100," all lower amounts are represented by numbers between "0" and
"100. STOP Then, if these units are to be of equal value, we simply add
_A_'s 3 marks together, and do the same for _B_ STOP (_d_) The conditions are the same as (_c_), but French is to have double
weight STOP Here we simply double the French marks, and add as before STOP (_e_) French is to have such weight, that, if other marks be equal, the
ultimate ratio is to be that of the French paper, so that a "0" in this
would swamp the candidate: but the other two subjects are only to affect
the result collectively, by the amount of knowledge shown, the two being
reckoned of equal value STOP Here I should add _A_'s German and Italian
marks together, and multiply by his French mark STOP But I need not go on: the problem may evidently be set with many varying
conditions, each requiring its own method of solution STOP The Problem in
Knot VI STOP was meant to belong to variety (_a_), and to make this clear, I
inserted the following passage:

"Usually the competitors differ in one point only STOP Thus, last year, Fifi
and Gogo made the same number of scarves in the trial week, and they
were equally light; but Fifi's were twice as warm as Gogo's, and she was
pronounced twice as good. STOP What I have said will suffice, I hope, as an answer to BALBUS, who holds
that (_a_) and (_c_) are the only possible varieties of the problem, and
that to say "We cannot use addition, therefore we must be intended to
use multiplication," is "no more illogical than, from knowledge that one
was not born in the night, to infer that he was born in the daytime";
and also to FIFEE, who says "I think a little more consideration will
show you that our 'error of _adding_ the proportional numbers together
for each candidate instead of _multiplying_' is no error at all. STOP Why,
even if addition _had_ been the right method to use, not one of the
writers (I speak from memory) showed any consciousness of the necessity
of fixing a "unit" for each subject STOP "No error at all! STOP They were
positively steeped in error STOP One correspondent (I do not name him, as the communication is not quite
friendly in tone) writes thus:--"I wish to add, very respectfully, that
I think it would be in better taste if you were to abstain from the very
trenchant expressions which you are accustomed to indulge in when
criticising the answer STOP That such a tone must not be" ("be not"? STOP "agreeable to the persons concerned who have made mistakes may possibly
have no great weight with you, but I hope you will feel that it would be
as well not to employ it, _unless you are quite certain of being correct
yourself_. STOP The only instances the writer gives of the "trenchant
expressions" are "hapless" and "malefactors. STOP I beg to assure him (and
any others who may need the assurance: I trust there are none) that all
such words have been used in jest, and with no idea that they could
possibly annoy any one, and that I sincerely regret any annoyance I may
have thus inadvertently given STOP May I hope that in future they will
recognise the distinction between severe language used in sober earnest,
and the "words of unmeant bitterness," which Coleridge has alluded to in
that lovely passage beginning "A little child, a limber elf" STOP If the
writer will refer to that passage, or to the preface to "Fire, Famine,
and Slaughter," he will find the distinction, for which I plead, far
better drawn out than I could hope to do in any words of mine STOP The writer's insinuation that I care not how much annoyance I give to my
readers I think it best to pass over in silence; but to his concluding
remark I must entirely demur STOP I hold that to use language likely to
annoy any of my correspondents would not be in the least justified by
the plea that I was "quite certain of being correct. STOP I trust that the

minutes STOP A traveller, starting on foot along with one of them, meets

and "_x_" the distance from the starting-point to where the traveller is
overtaken STOP Since the omnibus met is due at the starting-point in 2-1/2
minutes, it goes in that time as far as the traveller walks in 12-1/2;
_i.e._ it goes 5 times as fast STOP Now the overtaking omnibus is "_a_"
behind the traveller when he starts, and therefore goes "_a_ + _x_"
while he goes "_x_. STOP Hence _a_ + _x_ = 5_x_; _i.e._ 4_x_ = _a_, and _x_
= _a_/4 STOP This distance would be traversed by an omnibus in 15/4 minutes,
and therefore by the traveller in 5 x 15/4 STOP Hence he is overtaken in
18-3/4 minutes after starting, _i.e._ in 6-1/4 minutes after meeting the
omnibus STOP Four answers have been received, of which two are wrong STOP DINAH MITE
rightly states that the overtaking omnibus reached the point where they
met the other omnibus 5 minutes after they left, but wrongly concludes
that, going 5 times as fast, it would overtake them in another minute STOP The travellers are 5-minutes-walk ahead of the omnibus, and must walk
1-4th of this distance farther before the omnibus overtakes them, which
will be 1-5th of the distance traversed by the omnibus in the same time:
this will require 1-1/4 minutes more STOP NOLENS VOLENS tries it by a
process like "Achilles and the Tortoise. STOP He rightly states that, when
the overtaking omnibus leaves the gate, the travellers are 1-5th of
"_a_" ahead, and that it will take the omnibus 3 minutes to traverse
this distance; "during which time" the travellers, he tells us, go
1-15th of "_a_" (this should be 1-25th) STOP The travellers being now 1-15th
of "_a_" ahead, he concludes that the work remaining to be done is for

an amount equal to itself in bulk STOP How can this be true of a small
bucket floating in a larger one STOP _Solution._--Lardner means, by "displaces," "occupies a space which
might be filled with water without any change in the surroundings. STOP If
the portion of the floating bucket, which is above the water, could be
annihilated, and the rest of it transformed into water, the surrounding
water would not change its position: which agrees with Lardner's
statement STOP Five answers have been received, none of which explains the difficulty
arising from the well-known fact that a floating body is the same weight
as the displaced fluid STOP HECLA says that "only that portion of the
smaller bucket which descends below the original level of the water can
be properly said to be immersed, and only an equal bulk of water is
displaced. STOP Hence, according to HECLA, a solid, whose weight was equal
to that of an equal bulk of water, would not float till the whole of it
was below "the original level" of the water: but, as a matter of fact,
it would float as soon as it was all under water STOP MAGPIE says the
fallacy is "the assumption that one body can displace another from a
place where it isn't," and that Lardner's assertion is incorrect, except
when the containing vessel "was originally full to the brim. STOP But the
question of floating depends on the present state of things, not on past
history STOP OLD KING COLE takes the same view as HECLA STOP TYMPANUM and VINDEX
assume that "displaced" means "raised above its original level," and
merely explain how it comes to pass that the water, so raised, is less
in bulk than the immersed portion of bucket, and thus land
themselves--or rather set themselves floating--in the same boat as

many terms we take, we are always short of 4 inches by an amount equal
to the last term taken STOP Three answers have been received--but only two seem to me worthy of

entirely of a gravel-walk, spirally arranged, a yard wide and 3,630
yards long STOP Find the dimensions of the garden STOP _Answer._--60, 60-1/2 STOP _Solution._--The number of yards and fractions of a yard traversed in
walking along a straight piece of walk, is evidently the same as the
number of square-yards and fractions of a square-yard, contained in that
piece of walk: and the distance, traversed in passing through a
square-yard at a corner, is evidently a yard STOP Hence the area of the
garden is 3,630 square-yards: _i.e._, if _x_ be the width, _x_ (_x_ +
1/2) = 3,630 STOP Solving this Quadratic, we find _x_ = 60 STOP Hence the
dimensions are 60, 60-1/2 STOP Twelve answers have been received--seven right and five wrong STOP C. G. L., NABOB, OLD CROW, and TYMPANUM assume that the number of yards
in the length of the path is equal to the number of square-yards in the
garden STOP This is true, but should have been proved STOP But each is guilty of
darker deeds STOP C. G. L.'s "working" consists of dividing 3,630 by 60 STOP Whence came this divisor, oh Segiel STOP Divination STOP Or was it a dream STOP I
fear this solution is worth nothing STOP OLD CROW'S is shorter, and so (if
possible) worth rather less STOP He says the answer "is at once seen to be
60 x 60-1/2" STOP NABOB'S calculation is short, but "as rich as a Nabob" in
error STOP He says that the square root of 3,630, multiplied by 2, equals
the length plus the breadth STOP That is 60.25 x 2 = 120-1/2 STOP His first
assertion is only true of a _square_ garden STOP His second is irrelevant,
since 60.25 is _not_ the square-root of 3,630 STOP Nay, Bob, this will _not_
do STOP TYMPANUM says that, by extracting the square-root of 3,630, we get
60 yards with a remainder of 30/60, or half-a-yard, which we add so as
to make the oblong 60 x 60-1/2 STOP This is very terrible: but worse remains
behind STOP TYMPANUM proceeds thus:--"But why should there be the half-yard
at all STOP Because without it there would be no space at all for flowers STOP By means of it, we find reserved in the very centre a small plot of
ground, two yards long by half-a-yard wide, the only space not occupied
by walk. STOP But Balbus expressly said that the walk "used up the whole of
the area. STOP Oh, TYMPANUM STOP My tympa is exhausted: my brain is num STOP I can
say no more STOP HECLA indulges, again and again, in that most fatal of all habits in
computation--the making _two_ mistakes which cancel each other STOP She
takes _x_ as the width of the garden, in yards, and _x_ + 1/2 as its
length, and makes her first "coil" the sum of _x_-1/2, _x_-1/2, _x_-1,
_x_-1, _i.e._ 4_x_-3: but the fourth term should be _x_-1-1/2, so that
her first coil is 1/2 a yard too long STOP Her second coil is the sum of
_x_-2-1/2, _x_-2-1/2, _x_-3, _x_-3: here the first term should be _x_-2
and the last _x_-3-1/2: these two mistakes cancel, and this coil is
therefore right STOP And the same thing is true of every other coil but the
last, which needs an extra half-yard to reach the _end_ of the path: and
this exactly balances the mistake in the first coil STOP Thus the sum total
of the coils comes right though the working is all wrong STOP Of the seven who are right, DINAH MITE, JANET, MAGPIE, and TAFFY make
the same assumption as C. G. L. and Co STOP They then solve by a Quadratic STOP MAGPIE also tries it by Arithmetical Progression, but fails to notice
that the first and last "coils" have special values STOP ALUMNUS ETONAE attempts to prove what C. G. L. assumes by a particular
instance, taking a garden 6 by 5-1/2 STOP He ought to have proved it
generally: what is true of one number is not always true of others STOP OLD
KING COLE solves it by an Arithmetical Progression STOP It is right, but too
lengthy to be worth as much as a Quadratic STOP VINDEX proves it very neatly, by pointing out that a yard of walk
measured along the middle represents a square yard of garden, "whether
we consider the straight stretches of walk or the square yards at the
angles, in which the middle line goes half a yard in one direction and
then turns a right angle and goes half a yard in another direction. STOP CLASS LIST STOP I.

ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND

[Illustration]




I--DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE


Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do STOP Once or twice she had peeped into the
book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or
conversations? STOP So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her STOP There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so
very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear STOP Oh
dear STOP I shall be too late! STOP But when the Rabbit actually took a watch
out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice
started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take
out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after
it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under
the hedge STOP In another moment, down went Alice after it STOP [Illustration]

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed
to be a very deep well STOP Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her STOP First, she tried to
make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything;
then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were
filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and
pictures hung upon pegs STOP She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
she passed STOP It was labeled "ORANGE MARMALADE," but, to her great
disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it STOP Down, down, down STOP Would the fall never come to an end STOP There was nothing
else to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself STOP "Dinah'll miss me
very much to-night, I should think! STOP (Dinah was the cat. STOP "I hope
they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time STOP Dinah, my dear, I wish
you were down here with me! STOP Alice felt that she was dozing off, when
suddenly, thump STOP thump STOP down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry
leaves, and the fall was over STOP Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment STOP She looked up,
but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage and
the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it STOP There was not a
moment to be lost STOP Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to
hear it say, as it turned a corner, "Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late
it's getting! STOP She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but
the Rabbit was no longer to be seen STOP She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of
lamps hanging from the roof STOP There were doors all 'round the hall, but
they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side
and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
wondering how she was ever to get out again STOP Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass STOP There
was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that
this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas STOP either the
locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, it
would not open any of them STOP However, on the second time 'round, she came
upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a
little door about fifteen inches high STOP She tried the little golden key
in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted STOP [Illustration]

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage
into the loveliest garden you ever saw STOP How she longed to get out of
that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
doorway STOP "Oh," said Alice, "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope STOP I think I could, if I only knew how to begin. STOP Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on
it, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like
telescopes STOP This time she found a little bottle on it ("which certainly
was not here before," said Alice), and tied 'round the neck of the
bottle was a paper label, with the words "DRINK ME" beautifully printed
on it in large letters STOP "No, I'll look first," she said, "and see whether it's marked '_poison_'
or not," for she had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle
marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or
later STOP However, this bottle was _not_ marked "poison," so Alice ventured
to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of
cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered
toast), she very soon finished it off STOP "What a curious feeling! STOP said Alice STOP "I must be shutting up like a
telescope! STOP And so it was indeed STOP She was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden STOP After awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice STOP When she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery,
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried STOP "Come, there's no use in crying like that! STOP said Alice to herself rather
sharply STOP "I advise you to leave off this minute! STOP She generally gave
herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and
sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her
eyes STOP Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it and found in it a very small cake, on which the words "EAT
ME" were beautifully marked in currants STOP "Well, I'll eat it," said
Alice, "and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I'll
get into the garden, and I don't care which happens! STOP She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, "Which way STOP Which
way? STOP holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was
growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size STOP So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake STOP [Illustration]




II--THE POOL OF TEARS


"Curiouser and curiouser! STOP cried Alice (she was so much surprised that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English) STOP "Now I'm
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was STOP Good-by, feet STOP Oh,
my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings
for you now, dears STOP I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you. STOP Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in
fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door STOP Poor Alice STOP It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever STOP She sat down and began to cry again STOP She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all
'round her and reaching half down the hall STOP After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming STOP It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in
one hand and a large fan in the other STOP He came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himself, "Oh STOP the Duchess, the Duchess STOP Oh STOP _won't_ she be savage if I've kept her waiting! STOP When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, "If
you please, sir--" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white
kid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he
could go STOP [Illustration]

Alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the
time she went on talking STOP "Dear, dear STOP How queer everything is to-day STOP And yesterday things went on just as usual STOP _Was_ I the same when I got
up this morning STOP But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in
the world am I? STOP Ah, _that's_ the great puzzle! STOP As she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid-gloves while
she was talking STOP "How _can_ I have done that? STOP she thought STOP "I must be
growing small again. STOP She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was
going on shrinking rapidly STOP She soon found out that the cause of this
was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to
save herself from shrinking away altogether STOP "That _was_ a narrow escape! STOP said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence STOP "And
now for the garden! STOP And she ran with all speed back to the little door;
but, alas STOP the little door was shut again and the little golden key was
lying on the glass table as before STOP "Things are worse than ever,"
thought the poor child, "for I never was so small as this before,
never! STOP As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another moment,
splash STOP she was up to her chin in salt-water STOP Her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea STOP However, she soon made out that she
was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high STOP [Illustration]

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it
was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself STOP "Would it be of any use, now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse STOP Everything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should think very
likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no harm in trying. STOP So she
began, "O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool STOP I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse! STOP The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but
it said nothing STOP "Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice STOP "I dare say it's
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror. STOP So she began
again: "Ou est ma chatte? STOP which was the first sentence in her French
lesson-book STOP The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to
quiver all over with fright STOP "Oh, I beg your pardon! STOP cried Alice
hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings STOP "I quite
forgot you didn't like cats. STOP "Not like cats! STOP cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice STOP "Would
_you_ like cats, if you were me? STOP "Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone; "don't be angry
about it STOP And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah STOP I think you'd
take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her STOP She is such a dear,
quiet thing. STOP The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it
must be really offended STOP "We won't talk about her any more, if you'd
rather not. STOP "We, indeed! STOP cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its
tail STOP "As if _I_ would talk on such a subject STOP Our family always _hated_
cats--nasty, low, vulgar things STOP Don't let me hear the name again! STOP [Illustration: Alice at the Mad Tea Party. STOP "I won't indeed! STOP said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation STOP "Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs STOP There is such a nice
little dog near our house, I should like to show you STOP It kills all the
rats and--oh, dear! STOP cried Alice in a sorrowful tone STOP "I'm afraid I've
offended it again! STOP For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as
it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went STOP So she called softly after it, "Mouse dear STOP Do come back again, and we
won't talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don't like them! STOP When the
Mouse heard this, it turned 'round and swam slowly back to her; its face
was quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, "Let us get to
the shore and then I'll tell you my history and you'll understand why it
is I hate cats and dogs. STOP It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo,
a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures STOP Alice led the
way and the whole party swam to the shore STOP [Illustration]




III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE


They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross and uncomfortable STOP [Illustration]

The first question, of course, was how to get dry again STOP They had a
consultation about this and after a few minutes, it seemed quite natural
to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
known them all her life STOP At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of some authority among
them, called out, "Sit down, all of you, and listen to me STOP _I'll_ soon
make you dry enough! STOP They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with
the Mouse in the middle STOP "Ahem! STOP said the Mouse with an important air STOP "Are you all ready STOP This
is the driest thing I know STOP Silence all 'round, if you please STOP 'William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest STOP Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of
Mercia and Northumbria'--"

"Ugh! STOP said the Lory, with a shiver.

 STOP --'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it
advisable'--"

"Found _what_? STOP said the Duck STOP "Found _it_," the Mouse replied rather crossly; "of course, you know
what 'it' means. STOP "I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing," said the
Duck; "it's generally a frog or a worm STOP The question is, what did the
archbishop find? STOP The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, "'--found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
crown. STOP --How are you getting on now, my dear? STOP it continued, turning to
Alice as it spoke STOP "As wet as ever," said Alice in a melancholy tone; "it doesn't seem to
dry me at all. STOP "In that case," said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, "I move that
the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies--"

"Speak English! STOP said the Eaglet STOP "I don't know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either! STOP "What I was going to say," said the Dodo in an offended tone, "is that
the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race. STOP "What _is_ a Caucus-race? STOP said Alice STOP [Illustration]

"Why," said the Dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it. STOP First it
marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party
were placed along the course, here and there STOP There was no "One, two,
three and away! STOP but they began running when they liked and left off
when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over STOP However, when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite
dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, "The race is over! STOP and they
all crowded 'round it, panting and asking, "But who has won? STOP This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought STOP At last it said, "_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ must have prizes. STOP "But who is to give the prizes? STOP quite a chorus of voices asked STOP "Why, _she_, of course," said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, in
a confused way, "Prizes STOP Prizes! STOP Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand into her
pocket and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt-water had not
got into it) and handed them 'round as prizes STOP There was exactly one
a-piece, all 'round STOP The next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back STOP However, it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more STOP "You promised to tell me your history, you know," said Alice, "and why
it is you hate--C and D," she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again STOP "Mine is a long and a sad tale! STOP said the Mouse, turning to Alice and
sighing STOP "It _is_ a long tail, certainly," said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the Mouse's tail, "but why do you call it sad? STOP And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:--

    "Fury said to
      a mouse, That
         he met in the
            house, 'Let
              us both go
                to law: _I_
                 will prosecute
               _you_.--
                 Come, I'll
              take no denial:
             We
           must have
        the trial;
     For really
    this morning
    I've
    nothing
    to do. STOP Said the
     mouse to
      the cur,
       'Such a
        trial, dear
           sir, With
               no jury
                or judge,
                   would
                  be wasting
                our
             breath. STOP 'I'll be
        judge,
       I'll be
      jury,'
     said
    cunning
    old
     Fury;
      'I'll
       try
        the
         whole
          cause,
          and
         condemn
       you to
    death.' STOP "You are not attending! STOP said the Mouse to Alice, severely STOP "What are
you thinking of? STOP "I beg your pardon," said Alice very humbly, "you had got to the fifth
bend, I think? STOP "You insult me by talking such nonsense! STOP said the Mouse, getting up and
walking away STOP "Please come back and finish your story! STOP Alice called after it STOP And the
others all joined in chorus, "Yes, please do! STOP But the Mouse only shook
its head impatiently and walked a little quicker STOP "I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here! STOP said Alice STOP This caused a
remarkable sensation among the party STOP Some of the birds hurried off at
once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children,
"Come away, my dears STOP It's high time you were all in bed! STOP On various
pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone STOP "I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah STOP Nobody seems to like her down here and
I'm sure she's the best cat in the world! STOP Poor Alice began to cry
again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited STOP In a little while,
however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance
and she looked up eagerly STOP [Illustration]

[Illustration]




IV--THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL


It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; Alice heard it
muttering to itself, "The Duchess STOP The Duchess STOP Oh, my dear paws STOP Oh, my
fur and whiskers STOP She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets STOP Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder? STOP Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves
and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,
had vanished completely STOP Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an angry tone,
"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here STOP Run home this moment and
fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan STOP Quick, now! STOP "He took me for his housemaid! STOP said Alice, as she ran off STOP "How
surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! STOP As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name "W. RABBIT" engraved upon it STOP She went in without
knocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves STOP By this time, Alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a
table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny
white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was
just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell upon a little bottle
that stood near the looking-glass STOP She uncorked it and put it to her
lips, saying to herself, "I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for,
really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing! STOP Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing
against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being
broken STOP She hastily put down the bottle, remarking, "That's quite
enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any more. STOP Alas STOP It was too late to wish that STOP She went on growing and growing and
very soon she had to kneel down on the floor STOP Still she went on growing,
and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot
up the chimney, and said to herself, "Now I can do no more, whatever
happens STOP What _will_ become of me? STOP [Illustration]

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect
and she grew no larger STOP After a few minutes she heard a voice outside
and stopped to listen STOP "Mary Ann STOP Mary Ann! STOP said the voice STOP "Fetch me my gloves this moment! STOP Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs STOP Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it STOP Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as
the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure STOP Alice heard it say to itself, "Then I'll
go 'round and get in at the window. STOP "_That_ you won't! STOP thought Alice; and after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand and made a snatch in the air STOP She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame or something of that sort STOP Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--"Pat STOP Pat STOP Where are you? STOP And
then a voice she had never heard before, "Sure then, I'm here STOP Digging
for apples, yer honor! STOP "Here STOP Come and help me out of this STOP Now tell me, Pat, what's that in
the window? STOP "Sure, it's an arm, yer honor! STOP "Well, it's got no business there, at any rate; go and take it away! STOP There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then, and at last she spread out her hand again and made another
snatch in the air STOP This time there were _two_ little shrieks and more
sounds of broken glass STOP "I wonder what they'll do next! STOP thought Alice STOP "As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could_! STOP She waited for some time without hearing anything more STOP At last came a
rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together STOP She made out the words: "Where's the other ladder STOP Bill's got the other--Bill STOP Here, Bill STOP Will the roof bear?--Who's to go
down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't STOP _You_ do it STOP Here, Bill STOP The master
says you've got to go down the chimney! STOP Alice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till
she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney
close above her; then she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what
would happen next STOP The first thing she heard was a general chorus of "There goes Bill! STOP then the Rabbit's voice alone--"Catch him, you by the hedge! STOP Then
silence and then another confusion of voices--"Hold up his head--Brandy
now--Don't choke him--What happened to you? STOP Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, "Well, I hardly know--No
more, thank ye STOP I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket! STOP After a minute or two of silence, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say, "A barrowful will do, to begin with. STOP "A barrowful of _what_? STOP thought Alice STOP But she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window and some of them hit her in the face STOP Alice noticed, with some
surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they
lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head STOP "If I eat one of
these cakes," she thought, "it's sure to make _some_ change in my size. STOP So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly STOP As soon as she was small enough to get through
the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside STOP They all made a rush at Alice the
moment she appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found
herself safe in a thick wood STOP [Illustration: "The Duchess tucked her arm affectionately into
Alice's." STOP "The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size again; and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden STOP I suppose I
ought to eat or drink something or other, but the great question is
'What?' STOP Alice looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but
she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or
drink under the circumstances STOP There was a large mushroom growing near
her, about the same height as herself STOP She stretched herself up on
tiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyes immediately met those of a
large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top, with its arms
folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice
of her or of anything else STOP [Illustration]




V--ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR


At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed
Alice in a languid, sleepy voice STOP "Who are _you_? STOP said the Caterpillar STOP [Illustration]

Alice replied, rather shyly, "I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at
least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must
have changed several times since then. STOP "What do you mean by that? STOP said the Caterpillar, sternly STOP "Explain
yourself! STOP "I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir," said Alice, "because I'm
not myself, you see--being so many different sizes in a day is very
confusing. STOP She drew herself up and said very gravely, "I think you
ought to tell me who _you_ are, first. STOP "Why? STOP said the Caterpillar STOP As Alice could not think of any good reason and the Caterpillar seemed
to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away STOP "Come back! STOP the Caterpillar called after her STOP "I've something important
to say! STOP Alice turned and came back again STOP "Keep your temper," said the Caterpillar STOP "Is that all? STOP said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could STOP "No," said the Caterpillar STOP It unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said,
"So you think you're changed, do you? STOP "I'm afraid, I am, sir," said Alice STOP "I can't remember things as I
used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together! STOP "What size do you want to be? STOP asked the Caterpillar STOP "Oh, I'm not particular as to size," Alice hastily replied, "only one
doesn't like changing so often, you know STOP I should like to be a _little_
larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind," said Alice STOP "Three inches is such a
wretched height to be. STOP "It is a very good height indeed! STOP said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high) STOP In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom and
crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, "One side
will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow
shorter. STOP "One side of _what_ STOP The other side of _what_? STOP thought Alice to
herself STOP "Of the mushroom," said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment, it was out of sight STOP Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
to make out which were the two sides of it STOP At last she stretched her
arms 'round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge
with each hand STOP "And now which is which? STOP she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect STOP The next moment she felt a violent
blow underneath her chin--it had struck her foot STOP She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, as she was
shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other
bit STOP Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was
hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and managed to
swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit....

"Come, my head's free at last! STOP said Alice; but all she could see, when
she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise
like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her STOP "Where _have_ my shoulders got to STOP And oh, my poor hands, how is it I
can't see you? STOP She was delighted to find that her neck would bend
about easily in any direction, like a serpent STOP She had just succeeded in
curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among
the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a large
pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its
wings STOP [Illustration]

"Serpent! STOP cried the Pigeon STOP "I'm _not_ a serpent! STOP said Alice indignantly STOP "Let me alone! STOP "I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
hedges," the Pigeon went on, "but those serpents STOP There's no pleasing
them! STOP Alice was more and more puzzled STOP "As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs," said the Pigeon,
"but I must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day STOP And just as
I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," continued the Pigeon, raising
its voice to a shriek, "and just as I was thinking I should be free of
them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky STOP Ugh,
Serpent! STOP "But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you! STOP said Alice STOP "I'm a--I'm a--I'm a
little girl," she added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number
of changes she had gone through that day STOP "You're looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough," said the Pigeon;
"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a
serpent? STOP "It matters a good deal to _me_," said Alice hastily; "but I'm not
looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want
_yours_--I don't like them raw. STOP "Well, be off, then! STOP said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest STOP Alice crouched down among the trees as well as
she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
every now and then she had to stop and untwist it STOP After awhile she
remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height STOP It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it
felt quite strange at first STOP "The next thing is to get into that
beautiful garden--how _is_ that to be done, I wonder? STOP As she said this,
she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about
four feet high STOP "Whoever lives there," thought Alice, "it'll never do to
come upon them _this_ size; why, I should frighten them out of their
wits! STOP She did not venture to go near the house till she had brought
herself down to nine inches high STOP VI--PIG AND PEPPER


For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a
footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face
only, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door
with his knuckles STOP It was opened by another footman in livery, with a
round face and large eyes like a frog STOP [Illustration]

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, "For the
Duchess STOP An invitation from the Queen to play croquet. STOP The
Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, "From the Queen STOP An
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet. STOP Then they both bowed low
and their curls got entangled together STOP When Alice next peeped out, the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was
sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky STOP Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked STOP "There's no sort of use in knocking," said the Footman, "and that for
two reasons STOP First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are;
secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you. STOP And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise
going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces STOP "How am I to get in? STOP asked Alice STOP "_Are_ you to get in at all? STOP said the Footman STOP "That's the first
question, you know. STOP Alice opened the door and went in STOP The door led right into a large
kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other; the Duchess
was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the
cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which seemed to
be full of soup STOP "There's certainly too much pepper in that soup! STOP Alice said to herself,
as well as she could for sneezing STOP Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment's pause STOP The only two creatures in the
kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was
grinning from ear to ear STOP "Please would you tell me," said Alice, a little timidly, "why your cat
grins like that? STOP "It's a Cheshire-Cat," said the Duchess, "and that's why. STOP "I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know
that cats _could_ grin," said Alice STOP "You don't know much," said the Duchess, "and that's a fact. STOP Just then the cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once
set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the
baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,
plates and dishes STOP The Duchess took no notice of them, even when they
hit her, and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite
impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not STOP "Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing! STOP cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror STOP "Here STOP You may nurse it a bit, if you like! STOP the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke STOP "I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen," and she hurried out of the room STOP Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions STOP "If I
don't take this child away with me," thought Alice, "they're sure to
kill it in a day or two STOP Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind? STOP She
said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply STOP "If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear," said Alice, "I'll have
nothing more to do with you STOP Mind now! STOP Alice was just beginning to think to herself, "Now, what am I to do with
this creature, when I get it home? STOP when it grunted again so violently
that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm STOP This time there
could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than a pig;
so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood STOP Alice was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire-Cat sitting on a
bough of a tree a few yards off STOP The Cat only grinned when it saw her STOP "Cheshire-Puss," began Alice, rather timidly, "would you please tell me
which way I ought to go from here? STOP "In _that_ direction," the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, "lives
a Hatter; and in _that_ direction," waving the other paw, "lives a March
Hare STOP Visit either you like; they're both mad. STOP "But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked STOP "Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat; "we're all mad here STOP Do you
play croquet with the Queen to-day? STOP "I should like it very much," said Alice, "but I haven't been invited
yet. STOP "You'll see me there," said the Cat, and vanished STOP Alice had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
the March Hare; it was so large a house that she did not like to go near
till she had nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom STOP VII--A MAD TEA-PARTY


There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep STOP The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it STOP "No room STOP No room! STOP they cried out when they saw Alice
coming STOP "There's _plenty_ of room! STOP said Alice indignantly, and she sat
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table STOP The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this, but all he said
was "Why is a raven like a writing-desk? STOP "I'm glad they've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that," she
added aloud STOP "Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it? STOP said the
March Hare STOP "Exactly so," said Alice STOP "Then you should say what you mean," the March Hare went on STOP "I do," Alice hastily replied; "at least--at least I mean what I
say--that's the same thing, you know. STOP "You might just as well say," added the Dormouse, which seemed to be
talking in its sleep, "that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing
as 'I sleep when I breathe!' STOP "It _is_ the same thing with you," said the Hatter, and he poured a
little hot tea upon its nose STOP The Dormouse shook its head impatiently
and said, without opening its eyes, "Of course, of course; just what I
was going to remark myself. STOP [Illustration]

"Have you guessed the riddle yet? STOP the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again STOP "No, I give it up," Alice replied STOP "What's the answer? STOP "I haven't the slightest idea," said the Hatter STOP "Nor I," said the March Hare STOP Alice gave a weary sigh STOP "I think you might do something better with the
time," she said, "than wasting it in asking riddles that have no
answers. STOP "Take some more tea," the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly STOP "I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't
take more. STOP "You mean you can't take _less_," said the Hatter; "it's very easy to
take _more_ than nothing. STOP At this, Alice got up and walked off STOP The Dormouse fell asleep instantly
and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice; the last time she saw them, they were
trying to put the Dormouse into the tea-pot STOP [Illustration: The Trial of the Knave of Hearts. STOP "At any rate, I'll never go _there_ again! STOP said Alice, as she picked
her way through the wood STOP "It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
all my life! STOP Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees
had a door leading right into it STOP "That's very curious! STOP she thought STOP "I
think I may as well go in at once. STOP And in she went STOP Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little
glass table STOP Taking the little golden key, she unlocked the door that
led into the garden STOP Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she
had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high;
then she walked down the little passage; and _then_--she found herself
at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the
cool fountains STOP VIII--THE QUEEN'S CROQUET GROUND


A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red STOP Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as
she stood watching them STOP "Would you tell me, please," said Alice, a
little timidly, "why you are painting those roses? STOP Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two STOP Two began, in a low
voice, "Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and, if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know STOP So
you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--" At this
moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out, "The Queen STOP The Queen! STOP and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces STOP There was a sound of many footsteps
and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen STOP First came ten soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds STOP After these came the royal children; there were ten of them,
all ornamented with hearts STOP Next came the guests, mostly Kings and
Queens, and among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit STOP Then followed
the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet
cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND THE
QUEEN OF HEARTS STOP When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely, "Who is this? STOP She said it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply STOP "My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty," said Alice very politely;
but she added to herself, "Why, they're only a pack of cards, after
all! STOP "Can you play croquet? STOP shouted the Queen STOP The question was evidently
meant for Alice STOP "Yes! STOP said Alice loudly STOP "Come on, then! STOP roared the Queen STOP "It's--it's a very fine day! STOP said a timid voice to Alice STOP She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face STOP "Very," said Alice STOP "Where's the Duchess? STOP "Hush STOP Hush! STOP said the Rabbit STOP "She's under sentence of execution. STOP "What for? STOP said Alice STOP "She boxed the Queen's ears--" the Rabbit began STOP "Get to your places! STOP shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other STOP However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began STOP Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her
life; it was all ridges and furrows STOP The croquet balls were live
hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches STOP The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time,
the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting,
"Off with his head! STOP or "Off with her head! STOP about once in a minute STOP "They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here," thought Alice; "the
great wonder is that there's anyone left alive! STOP She was looking about for some way of escape, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air STOP "It's the Cheshire-Cat," she said to herself;
"now I shall have somebody to talk to. STOP "How are you getting on? STOP said the Cat STOP "I don't think they play at all fairly," Alice said, in a rather
complaining tone; "and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular. STOP "How do you like the Queen? STOP said the Cat in a low voice STOP "Not at all," said Alice STOP [Illustration]

Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going
on STOP So she went off in search of her hedgehog STOP The hedgehog was engaged
in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent
opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other; the only
difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of
the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of way,
to fly up into a tree STOP She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under
her arm, that it might not escape again STOP Just then Alice ran across the Duchess (who was now out of prison) STOP She
tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's and they walked off together STOP Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper STOP She was a
little startled, however, when she heard the voice of the Duchess close
to her ear STOP "You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes
you forget to talk. STOP "The game's going on rather better now," Alice said, by way of keeping
up the conversation a little STOP "'Tis so," said the Duchess; "and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love,
'tis love that makes the world go 'round!' STOP "Somebody said," Alice whispered, "that it's done by everybody minding
his own business! STOP "Ah, well STOP It means much the same thing," said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added "and the moral of
_that_ is--'Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of
themselves.' STOP To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers
began to tremble STOP Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of
them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm STOP "Now, I give you fair warning," shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke, "either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time STOP Take your choice! STOP The Duchess took her choice, and
was gone in a moment STOP "Let's go on with the game," the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground STOP All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with
the other players and shouting, "Off with his head! STOP or "Off with her
head! STOP By the end of half an hour or so, all the players, except the
King, the Queen and Alice, were in custody of the soldiers and under
sentence of execution STOP Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with
Alice STOP Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, "You
are all pardoned. STOP Suddenly the cry "The Trial's beginning! STOP was heard in the distance, and
Alice ran along with the others STOP IX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS STOP The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand
and a scroll of parchment in the other STOP In the very middle of the court
was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it STOP "I wish they'd get the
trial done," Alice thought, "and hand 'round the refreshments! STOP The judge, by the way, was the King and he wore his crown over his great
wig STOP "That's the jury-box," thought Alice; "and those twelve creatures
(some were animals and some were birds) I suppose they are the jurors. STOP Just then the White Rabbit cried out "Silence in the court! STOP "Herald, read the accusation! STOP said the King STOP [Illustration]

On this, the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then
unrolled the parchment-scroll and read as follows:

    "The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
      All on a summer day;
    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts
      And took them quite away! STOP "Call the first witness," said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet and called out, "First witness! STOP The first witness was the Hatter STOP He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread and butter in the other STOP "You ought to have finished," said the King STOP "When did you begin? STOP The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm in arm with the Dormouse STOP "Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was," he said STOP "Give your evidence," said the King, "and don't be nervous, or I'll have
you executed on the spot. STOP This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept shifting from
one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in his
confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread
and butter STOP Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was
beginning to grow larger again STOP The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went
down on one knee STOP "I'm a poor man, Your Majesty," he began STOP "You're a _very_ poor _speaker_," said the King STOP "You may go," said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court STOP "Call the next witness! STOP said the King STOP The next witness was the Duchess's cook STOP She carried the pepper-box in
her hand and the people near the door began sneezing all at once STOP "Give your evidence," said the King STOP "Sha'n't," said the cook STOP The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a low voice,
"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness. STOP "Well, if I must, I must," the King said STOP "What are tarts made of? STOP "Pepper, mostly," said the cook STOP For some minutes the whole court was in confusion and by the time they
had settled down again, the cook had disappeared STOP "Never mind! STOP said the King, "call the next witness. STOP Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list STOP Imagine her
surprise when he read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the
name "Alice! STOP X--ALICE'S EVIDENCE


"Here! STOP cried Alice STOP She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over
the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd
below STOP "Oh, I _beg_ your pardon! STOP she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay STOP "The trial cannot proceed," said the King, "until all the jurymen are
back in their proper places--_all_," he repeated with great emphasis,
looking hard at Alice STOP "What do you know about this business? STOP the King said to Alice STOP "Nothing whatever," said Alice STOP The King then read from his book: "Rule forty-two STOP _All persons more
than a mile high to leave the court_. STOP "_I'm_ not a mile high," said Alice STOP "Nearly two miles high," said the Queen STOP [Illustration]

"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate," said Alice STOP The King turned pale and shut his note-book hastily STOP "Consider your
verdict," he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice STOP "There's more evidence to come yet, please Your Majesty," said the White
Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry STOP "This paper has just been picked
up STOP It seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to--to somebody. STOP He
unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, "It isn't a letter, after all;
it's a set of verses. STOP "Please, Your Majesty," said the Knave, "I didn't write it and they
can't prove that I did; there's no name signed at the end. STOP "You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your
name like an honest man," said the King STOP There was a general clapping of
hands at this STOP "Read them," he added, turning to the White Rabbit STOP There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit read out the
verses STOP "That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet," said the
King STOP "_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it," ventured Alice STOP "If there's no meaning in it," said the King, "that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any STOP Let the jury consider
their verdict. STOP "No, no! STOP said the Queen STOP "Sentence first--verdict afterwards. STOP "Stuff and nonsense! STOP said Alice loudly STOP "The idea of having the
sentence first! STOP "Hold your tongue! STOP said the Queen, turning purple STOP "I won't! STOP said Alice STOP "Off with her head! STOP the Queen shouted at the top of her voice STOP Nobody
moved STOP "Who cares for _you_? STOP said Alice (she had grown to her full size by
this time) STOP "You're nothing but a pack of cards! STOP [Illustration]

At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon
her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face STOP "Wake up, Alice dear! STOP said her sister STOP "Why, what a long sleep you've
had! STOP "Oh, I've had such a curious dream! STOP said Alice STOP And she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange adventures
of hers that you have just been reading about STOP Alice got up and ran off,
thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had
been STOP [Illustration]

[Sidenote: _Down the Rabbit-Hole_]

ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had
peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice,
"without pictures or conversations? STOP So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid) whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her STOP There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh
dear STOP Oh dear STOP I shall be too late! STOP (when she thought it over
afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit
actually _took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it,
and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across
her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to
see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge STOP In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again STOP The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed
to be a very deep well STOP [Illustration]

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what
was going to happen next STOP First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs STOP She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled "ORANGE MARMALADE," but to her disappointment it
was empty; she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
she fell past it STOP "Well! STOP thought Alice to herself STOP "After such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs STOP How brave they'll all think me at
home STOP Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
of the house! STOP (Which was very likely true. STOP Down, down, down STOP Would the fall _never_ come to an end STOP "I wonder how
many miles I've fallen by this time? STOP she said aloud STOP "I must be getting
somewhere near the centre of the earth STOP Let me see: that would be four
thousand miles down STOP I think--" (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as
there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it
over) "--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what
Latitude or Longitude I've got to? STOP (Alice had no idea what Latitude
was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to
say. STOP Presently she began again STOP "I wonder if I shall fall right _through_ the
earth STOP How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with
their heads downwards STOP The Antipathies, I think--" (she was rather glad
there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the
right word) "--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country
is, you know STOP Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia? STOP (and she
tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy _curtseying_ as you're falling
through the air STOP Do you think you could manage it? STOP "And what an
ignorant little girl she'll think me STOP No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps
I shall see it written up somewhere. STOP Down, down, down STOP There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again STOP "Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think! STOP (Dinah was the cat. STOP "I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time STOP Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me STOP There are
no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's
very like a mouse, you know STOP But do cats eat bats, I wonder? STOP And here
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, "Do cats eat bats STOP Do cats eat bats? STOP and sometimes,
"Do bats eat cats? STOP for, you see, as she couldn't answer either
question, it didn't much matter which way she put it STOP She felt that she
was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in
hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, "Now, Dinah, tell me
the truth: did you ever eat a bat? STOP when suddenly, thump STOP thump STOP down
she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over STOP Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long
passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it STOP There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and
was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, "Oh my ears and
whiskers, how late it's getting! STOP She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof STOP There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again STOP Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first
idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but,
alas STOP either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at
any rate it would not open any of them STOP However, on the second time
round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted STOP Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage
into the loveliest garden you ever saw STOP How she longed to get out of
that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
doorway; "and even if my head would go through," thought poor Alice, "it
would be of very little use without my shoulders STOP Oh, how I wish I could
shut up like a telescope STOP I think I could, if I only knew how to begin. STOP For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that
Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
impossible STOP There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it ("which certainly was not here
before," said Alice,) and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words "DRINK ME" beautifully printed on it in large
letters STOP It was all very well to say "Drink me," but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry STOP "No, I'll look first," she said, "and
see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not;" for she had read several
nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by
wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they _would_ not
remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a
red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if you
cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she
had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked
"poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later STOP However, this bottle was _not_ marked "poison," so Alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, coffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off STOP "What a curious feeling! STOP said Alice STOP "I must be shutting up like a
telescope. STOP And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through that little door into that lovely garden STOP First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this: "for it might end, you know," said
Alice to herself, "in my going out altogether, like a candle STOP I wonder
what I should be like then? STOP And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for she could not
remember ever having seen such a thing STOP After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice STOP when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried STOP "Come, there's no use in crying like that! STOP said Alice to herself,
rather sharply STOP "I advise you to leave off this minute! STOP She generally
gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and
sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her
eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people STOP "But it's no use now," thought poor Alice, "to pretend to be two people STOP Why there's hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable person! STOP Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
"EAT ME" were beautifully marked in currants STOP "Well, I'll eat it," said
Alice, "and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll
get into the garden, and I don't care which happens! STOP She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, "Which way STOP Which
way? STOP holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size; to be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats cake,
but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but
out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid
for life to go on in the common way STOP So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake STOP [Sidenote: _Pool of Tears_]

"CURIOUSER and curiouser! STOP cried Alice (she was so much
surprised, that for a moment she quite forgot how to speak good
English); "now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was STOP Good-bye, feet! STOP (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to
be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off) STOP "Oh, my poor
little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you
now, dears STOP I'm sure _I_ sha'n't be able STOP I shall be a great deal too
far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you
can--but I must be kind to them," thought Alice, "or perhaps they won't
walk the way I want to go STOP Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of
boots every Christmas. STOP And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it STOP "They must
go by the carrier," she thought; "and how funny it'll seem, sending
presents to one's own feet STOP And how odd the directions will look STOP Alice's Right Foot, Esq STOP Hearthrug,
                  near the Fender,
                      (with Alice's love) STOP Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking! STOP Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little
golden key and hurried off to the garden door STOP Poor Alice STOP It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again STOP "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said Alice, "a great girl like
you" (she might well say this), "to go on crying in this way STOP Stop this
moment, I tell you! STOP But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches
deep and reaching half down the hall STOP [Illustration: CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER]

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming STOP It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in
one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great
hurry, muttering to himself as he came, "Oh STOP the Duchess, the Duchess STOP Oh STOP won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting! STOP Alice felt so
desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, "If you please,
sir----" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
the fan, and scurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go STOP Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking STOP "Dear, dear STOP How
queer everything is to-day STOP And yesterday things went on just as usual STOP I wonder if I've been changed during the night STOP Let me think: _was_ I
the same when I got up this morning STOP I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different STOP But if I'm not the same, the next question
is, who in the world am I STOP Ah, _that's_ the great puzzle! STOP And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them STOP "I'm sure I'm not Ada," she said, "for her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh STOP she knows such a
very little STOP Besides, _she's_ she, and _I'm_ I, and--oh dear, how
puzzling it all is STOP I'll try if I know all the things I used to know STOP Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
and four times seven is--oh dear STOP I shall never get to twenty at that
rate STOP However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try
Geography STOP London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
Rome, and Rome--no, _that's_ all wrong, I'm certain STOP I must have been
changed for Mabel STOP I'll try and say '_How doth the little----_'" and she
crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to
repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did
not come the same as they used to do:--

          "How doth the little crocodile
             Improve his shining tail,
           And pour the waters of the Nile
             On every golden scale STOP "How cheerfully he seems to grin,
             How neatly spreads his claws,
           And welcomes little fishes in,
             With gently smiling jaws! STOP "I'm sure those are not the right words," said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on STOP "I must be Mabel, after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh STOP ever so many lessons to learn STOP No, I've
made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here STOP It'll be no
use their putting their heads down and saying, 'Come up again, dear! STOP I
shall only look up and say, 'Who am I then STOP Tell me that first, and
then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down
here till I'm somebody else'--but, oh dear! STOP cried Alice with a sudden
burst of tears, "I do wish they _would_ put their heads down STOP I am so
_very_ tired of being all alone here! STOP As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while
she was talking STOP "How _can_ I have done that? STOP she thought STOP "I must be
growing small again. STOP She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now
about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found
out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped
it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether STOP "That _was_ a narrow escape! STOP said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; "and
now for the garden! STOP and she ran with all speed back to the little door:
but alas STOP the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was
lying on the glass table as before, "and things are worse than ever,"
thought the poor child, "for I never was so small as this before, never STOP And I declare it's too bad, that it is! STOP As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash STOP she was up to her chin in salt water STOP Her first idea was that she had
somehow fallen into the sea, "and in that case I can go back by
railway," she said to herself STOP (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station. STOP However, she soon
made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she
was nine feet high STOP "I wish I hadn't cried so much! STOP said Alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out STOP "I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears STOP That _will_ be a queer thing, to be sure STOP However, everything is queer to-day. STOP Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself STOP "Would it be of any use now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse STOP Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying. STOP So she
began: "O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool STOP I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse! STOP (Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse; she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, "A mouse--of
a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!" STOP The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing STOP "Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice; "I daresay it's
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror. STOP (For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened. STOP So she began again: "Ou est ma chatte? STOP which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book STOP The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright STOP "Oh, I beg your pardon! STOP cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt
the poor animal's feelings STOP "I quite forgot you didn't like cats. STOP "Not like cats! STOP cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice STOP "Would
_you_ like cats if you were me? STOP "Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone: "don't be angry
about it STOP And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her STOP She is such a dear quiet
thing," Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
pool, "and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and
washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's
such a capital one for catching mice----oh, I beg your pardon! STOP cried
Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
felt certain it must be really offended STOP "We won't talk about her any
more if you'd rather not. STOP "We, indeed! STOP cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail STOP "As if _I_ would talk on such a subject STOP Our family always _hated_
cats: nasty, low, vulgar things STOP Don't let me hear the name again! STOP [Illustration: _The Pool of Tears_]

"I won't indeed! STOP said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation STOP "Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? STOP The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: "There is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you STOP A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair STOP And it'll fetch things
when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all
sorts of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a
farmer, you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred
pounds STOP He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear! STOP cried Alice in a
sorrowful tone, "I'm afraid I've offended it again! STOP For the Mouse was
swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a
commotion in the pool as it went STOP So she called softly after it, "Mouse dear STOP Do come back again, and we
won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them! STOP When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her:
its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a
low trembling voice, "Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs. STOP It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,
a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures STOP Alice led the
way, and the whole party swam to the shore STOP [Sidenote: _A Caucus-race and a Long Tale_]

THEY were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on
the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur
clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable STOP The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
known them all her life STOP Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, "I am older than
you, and must know better;" and this Alice would not allow without
knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its
age, there was no more to be said STOP At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out "Sit down, all of you, and listen to me STOP _I'll_ soon make you
dry enough! STOP They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse
in the middle STOP Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon STOP "Ahem! STOP said the Mouse with an important air STOP "Are you all ready STOP This
is the driest thing I know STOP Silence all round, if you please STOP 'William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest STOP Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria--'"

"Ugh! STOP said the Lory, with a shiver STOP "I beg your pardon! STOP said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely STOP "Did
you speak? STOP "Not I! STOP said the Lory hastily STOP "I thought you did," said the Mouse, "--I proceed STOP 'Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
Stigand, the patriotic Archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--'"

"Found _what_? STOP said the Duck STOP "Found _it_," the Mouse replied rather crossly: "of course you know what
'it' means. STOP "I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing," said the
Duck; "it's generally a frog or a worm STOP The question is, what did the
archbishop find? STOP The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, "'--found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
crown STOP William's conduct at first was moderate STOP But the insolence of his
Normans--' How are you getting on now, my dear? STOP it continued, turning
to Alice as it spoke STOP "As wet as ever," said Alice in a melancholy tone; "doesn't seem to dry
me at all. STOP "In that case," said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, "I move that
the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies----"

"Speak English! STOP said the Eaglet STOP "I don't know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either! STOP And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly STOP "What I was going to say," said the Dodo in an offended tone, "was that
the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race. STOP "What _is_ a Caucus-race? STOP said Alice; not that she much wanted to know,
but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to speak,
and no one else seemed inclined to say anything STOP "Why," said the Dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it. STOP (And, as
you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day, I will tell
you how the Dodo managed it. STOP First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ("the exact
shape doesn't matter," it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there STOP There was no "One, two, three, and
away," but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over STOP However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
the Dodo suddenly called "The race is over! STOP and they all crowded round
it, panting, and asking "But who has won? STOP This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
and it stood for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of
him), while the rest waited in silence STOP At last the Dodo said
"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ must have prizes. STOP "But who is to give the prizes? STOP quite a chorus of voices asked STOP "Why, _she_, of course," said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
confused way, "Prizes STOP Prizes! STOP Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt water had not
got into it), and handed them round as prizes STOP There was exactly one
apiece all round STOP _They all crowded round it panting and asking,
          "But who has won STOP "_

[Illustration]

"But she must have a prize herself, you know," said the Mouse STOP "Of course," the Dodo replied very gravely STOP "What else have you got in your pocket? STOP it went on, turning to Alice STOP "Only a thimble," said Alice sadly STOP "Hand it over here," said the Dodo STOP Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying "We beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble;" and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered STOP Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
could STOP The next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back STOP However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more STOP "You promised to tell me your history, you know," said Alice, "and why
it is you hate--C and D," she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again STOP [Illustration]

"Mine is a long and sad tale! STOP said the Mouse, turning to Alice and
sighing STOP "It _is_ a long tail, certainly," said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the Mouse's tail; "but why do you call it sad? STOP And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:--

thinking of? STOP "I beg your pardon," said Alice very humbly: "you had got to the fifth
bend, I think? STOP "I had _not_! STOP cried the Mouse, angrily STOP "A knot! STOP said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her STOP "Oh, do let me help to undo it! STOP "I shall do nothing of the sort," said the Mouse, getting up and walking
away STOP "You insult me by talking such nonsense! STOP "I didn't mean it! STOP pleaded poor Alice STOP "But you're so easily offended,
you know! STOP The Mouse only growled in reply STOP "Please come back and finish your story! STOP Alice called after it STOP And the
others all joined in chorus, "Yes, please do! STOP but the Mouse only shook
its head impatiently and walked a little quicker STOP "What a pity it wouldn't stay! STOP sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite
out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her
daughter, "Ah, my dear STOP Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
_your_ temper! STOP "Hold your tongue, Ma! STOP said the young Crab, a little
snappishly STOP "You're enough to try the patience of an oyster! STOP "I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do! STOP said Alice aloud, addressing
nobody in particular STOP "She'd soon fetch it back! STOP "And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question? STOP said the
Lory STOP Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
"Dinah's our cat STOP And she's such a capital one for catching mice, you
ca'n't think STOP And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds STOP Why,
she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it! STOP This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party STOP Some of the
birds hurried off at once; one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking "I really must be getting home; the night-air
doesn't suit my throat! STOP and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to
its children "Come away, my dears STOP It's high time you were all in bed! STOP On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone STOP "I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah! STOP she said to herself in a melancholy
tone STOP "Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
cat in the world STOP Oh, my dear Dinah STOP I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more! STOP And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited STOP In a little while, however, she again heard a
little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
back to finish his story STOP [Sidenote: _The Rabbit sends in a Little Bill_]

IT was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and
looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she
heard it muttering to itself, "The Duchess STOP The Duchess STOP Oh my dear
paws STOP Oh my fur and whiskers STOP She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets
are ferrets STOP Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder? STOP Alice guessed
in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since
her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
little door, had vanished completely STOP Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
called out to her in an angry tone, "Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
doing out here STOP Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
a fan STOP Quick, now! STOP And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at
once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
mistake it had made STOP "He took me for his housemaid," she said to herself as she ran STOP "How
surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am STOP But I'd better take him
his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them. STOP As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name "W. RABBIT" engraved upon it STOP She went in without
knocking, and hurried up stairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves STOP [Illustration: "_Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here?_"]

"How queer it seems," Alice said to herself, "to be going messages for a
rabbit STOP I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next! STOP And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: "'Miss Alice STOP Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk! STOP 'Coming in a minute, nurse STOP But I've got to watch this mouse-hole till Dinah comes back, and see
that the mouse doesn't get out. STOP Only I don't think," Alice went on,
"that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people
about like that! STOP By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
bottle that stood near the looking-glass STOP There was no label this time
with the words "DRINK ME," but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
to her lips STOP "I know _something_ interesting is sure to happen," she
said to herself, "whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see
what this bottle does STOP I do hope it will make me grow large again, for
really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing! STOP It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken STOP She hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself "That's quite enough--I hope I
sha'n't grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish
I hadn't drunk quite so much! STOP Alas STOP it was too late to wish that STOP She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head STOP Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself "Now I
can do no more, whatever happens STOP What _will_ become of me? STOP Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy STOP "It was much pleasanter at home," thought poor Alice, "when one wasn't
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits STOP I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and
yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life STOP I do
wonder what _can_ have happened to me STOP When I used to read fairy-tales,
I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the
middle of one STOP There ought to be a book written about me, that there
ought STOP And when I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now," she
added in a sorrowful tone; "at least there's no room to grow up any more
_here_. STOP "But then," thought Alice, "shall I _never_ get any older than I am now STOP That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but
then--always to have lessons to learn STOP Oh, I shouldn't like _that_! STOP "Oh, you foolish Alice! STOP she answered herself STOP "How can you learn
lessons in here STOP Why, there's hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
for any lesson-books! STOP And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making
quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard
a voice outside, and stopped to listen STOP "Mary Ann STOP Mary Ann! STOP said the voice STOP "Fetch me my gloves this moment! STOP Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs STOP Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it STOP Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure STOP Alice heard it say to itself "Then I'll
go round and get in at the window. STOP "_That_ you won't" thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air STOP She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort STOP Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--"Pat STOP Pat STOP Where are you? STOP And
then a voice she had never heard before, "Sure then I'm here STOP Digging
for apples, yer honour! STOP "Digging for apples, indeed! STOP said the Rabbit angrily STOP "Here STOP Come and
help me out of _this_! STOP (Sounds of more broken glass. STOP "Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window? STOP "Sure, it's an arm, yer honour. STOP (He pronounced it "arrum." STOP "An arm, you goose STOP Who ever saw one that size STOP Why, it fills the whole
window! STOP "Sure, it does, yer honour STOP but it's an arm for all that. STOP "Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away! STOP There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, "Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
all! STOP "Do as I tell you, you coward! STOP and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air STOP This time there were
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass STOP "What a number of
cucumber-frames there must be! STOP thought Alice STOP "I wonder what they'll do
next STOP As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could_ STOP I'm sure _I_ don't want to stay in here any longer! STOP She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cart-wheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together: she made out the words: "Where's the other
ladder?--Why I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill STOP Fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em
together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh STOP they'll do
well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill STOP catch hold of this
rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down STOP Heads below! STOP (a loud crash)--"Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I
fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't STOP _You_ do
it!--_That_ I won't, then STOP Bill's to go down--Here, Bill STOP the master
says you've to go down the chimney! STOP "Oh STOP So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he? STOP said Alice to
herself STOP "Why, they seem to put everything upon Bill STOP I wouldn't be in
Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I _think_ I can kick a little! STOP She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself "This is Bill," she gave one sharp kick, and waited to
see what would happen next STOP The first thing she heard was a general chorus of "There goes Bill! STOP then the Rabbit's voice alone--"Catch him, you by the hedge! STOP then
silence, and then another confusion of voices--"Hold up his head--Brandy
now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow STOP What happened to you STOP Tell
us all about it! STOP At last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ("That's Bill," thought
Alice,) "Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm
a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket! STOP "So you did, old fellow! STOP said the others STOP "We must burn the house down! STOP said the Rabbit's voice STOP And Alice
called out as loud as she could, "If you do, I'll set Dinah at you! STOP There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself "I
wonder what they _will_ do next STOP If they had any sense, they'd take the
roof off. STOP After a minute or two they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say "A barrowful will do, to begin with. STOP "A barrowful of _what_? STOP thought Alice STOP But she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face STOP "I'll put a stop to this,"
she said to herself, and shouted out "You'd better not do that again! STOP which produced another dead silence STOP Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head STOP "If I eat one of these cakes," she thought, "it's sure to make
_some_ change in my size; and, as it can't possibly make me larger, it
must make me smaller, I suppose. STOP So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly STOP As soon as she was small enough to get through
the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside STOP The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in
the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle STOP They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood STOP "The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herself, as she wandered
about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size again; and the second
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden STOP I think that will be
the best plan. STOP It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and, while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry STOP An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her STOP "Poor little
thing! STOP said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
spite of all her coaxing STOP Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and, the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a little
way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the
while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its
tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut STOP This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and
till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance STOP "And yet what a dear little puppy it was! STOP said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves STOP "I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd
only been the right size to do it STOP Oh, dear STOP I'd nearly forgotten that
I've got to grow up again STOP Let me see--how _is_ it to be managed STOP I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what? STOP The great question certainly was, what STOP Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances STOP There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and, when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it STOP She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of
anything else STOP [Sidenote: _Advice from a Caterpillar_]

THE Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some
time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice STOP "Who are _you_? STOP said the Caterpillar STOP This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation STOP Alice replied,
rather shyly, "I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know who
I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed
several times since then. STOP "What do you mean by that? STOP said the Caterpillar sternly STOP "Explain
yourself! STOP "I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir," said Alice, "because I'm
not myself, you see. STOP "I don't see," said the Caterpillar STOP "I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," Alice replied very politely,
"for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing. STOP "It isn't," said the Caterpillar STOP "Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet," said Alice, "but when you
have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
queer, won't you? STOP "Not a bit," said the Caterpillar STOP "Well, perhaps your feelings may be different," said Alice; "all I know
is, it would feel very queer to _me_. STOP "You! STOP said the Caterpillar contemptuously STOP "Who are _you_? STOP Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation STOP Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such _very_
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, "I think
you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first. STOP "Why? STOP said the Caterpillar STOP [Illustration: _Advice from a Caterpillar_]

Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_
unpleasant state of mind, she turned away STOP "Come back! STOP the Caterpillar called after her STOP "I've something important
to say! STOP This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again STOP "Keep your temper," said the Caterpillar STOP "Is that all? STOP said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could STOP "No," said the Caterpillar STOP Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing STOP For some
minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, "So you think
you're changed, do you? STOP "I'm afraid I am, sir," said Alice; "I can't remember things as I
used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together! STOP "Can't remember _what_ things? STOP said the Caterpillar STOP "Well, I've tried to say '_How doth the little busy bee_,' but it all
came different! STOP Alice replied in a very melancholy voice STOP "Repeat '_You are old, Father William_,'" said the Caterpillar STOP Alice folded her hands, and began:--

          "You are old, Father William," the young man said,
            "And your hair has become very white;
          And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
            Do you think, at your age, it is right? STOP "In my youth," Father William replied to his son,
            "I feared it might injure the brain;
          But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
            Why, I do it again and again. STOP "You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,
            And have grown most uncommonly fat;
          Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
            Pray, what is the reason of that? STOP "In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
            "I kept all my limbs very supple
          By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
            Allow me to sell you a couple? STOP "You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak
            For anything tougher than suet;
          Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
            Pray, how did you manage to do it? STOP "In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law
            And argued each case with my wife;
          And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
            Has lasted the rest of my life. STOP "You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose
            That your eye was as steady as ever;
          Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
            What made you so awfully clever? STOP "I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"
            Said his father; "don't give yourself airs STOP Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff STOP Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs! STOP "That is not said right," said the Caterpillar STOP "Not _quite_ right, I'm afraid," said Alice, timidly; "some of the
words have got altered. STOP "It is wrong from beginning to end," said the Caterpillar, decidedly,
and there was silence for some minutes STOP The Caterpillar was the first to speak STOP "What size do you want to be? STOP it asked STOP "Oh, I'm not particular as to size," Alice hastily replied; "only one
doesn't like changing so often, you know. STOP "I _don't_ know," said the Caterpillar STOP Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in all her
life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper STOP "Are you content now? STOP said the Caterpillar STOP "Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn't
mind," said Alice: "three inches is such a wretched height to be. STOP "It is a very good height indeed! STOP said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high) STOP "But I'm not used to it! STOP pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone STOP And she
thought to herself, "I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
offended! STOP "You'll get used to it in time," said the Caterpillar; and it put its
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again STOP This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again STOP In a
minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself STOP Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking as it went,
"One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter. STOP "One side of _what_ STOP The other side of _what_? STOP thought Alice to
herself STOP "Of the mushroom," said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight STOP Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
round, she found this a very difficult question STOP However, at last she
stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit
of the edge with each hand STOP "And now which is which? STOP she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent
blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot STOP [Illustration]

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit STOP Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
left-hand bit STOP "Come, my head's free at last! STOP said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her STOP "What _can_ all that green stuff be? STOP said Alice STOP "And where have my
shoulders got to STOP And oh, my poor hands, how is it I ca'n't see you? STOP She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves STOP As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she
tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her
neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent STOP She had
just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going
to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops
of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made
her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and
was beating her violently with its wings STOP "Serpent! STOP screamed the Pigeon STOP "I'm _not_ a serpent! STOP said Alice indignantly STOP "Let me alone! STOP "Serpent, I say again! STOP repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,
and added with a kind of a sob, "I've tried every way, and nothing seems
to suit them! STOP "I haven't the least idea what you're talking about," said Alice STOP "I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
hedges," the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; "but those
serpents STOP There's no pleasing them! STOP Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished STOP "As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs," said the Pigeon;
"but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day STOP Why, I
haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks! STOP "I'm very sorry you've been annoyed," said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning STOP [Illustration]

"And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, "and just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from
the sky STOP Ugh, Serpent! STOP "But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you! STOP said Alice STOP "I'm a---- I'm a
----"

"Well STOP _What_ are you? STOP said the Pigeon STOP "I can see you're trying to
invent something! STOP "I--I'm a little girl," said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day STOP "A likely story indeed! STOP said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt STOP "I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
_one_ with such a neck as that STOP No, no STOP You're a serpent; and there's no
use denying it STOP I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg! STOP "I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly," said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; "but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know. STOP "I don't believe it," said the Pigeon; "but if they do, why then
they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say. STOP This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, "You're
looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
me whether you're a little girl or a serpent? STOP "It matters a good deal to _me_," said Alice hastily; "but I'm not
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want _yours_:
I don't like them raw. STOP "Well, be off, then! STOP said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest STOP Alice crouched down among the trees as well as
she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
every now and then she had to stop and untwist it STOP After a while she
remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height STOP It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual STOP "Come, there's half my plan done
now STOP How puzzling all these changes are STOP I'm never sure what I'm going
to be, from one minute to another STOP However, I've got back to my right
size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how _is_
that to be done, I wonder? STOP As she said this, she came suddenly upon an
open place, with a little house in it about four feet high STOP "Whoever
lives there," thought Alice, "it'll never do to come upon them _this_
size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits! STOP So she began
nibbling at the right-hand bit again, and did not venture to go near the
house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high STOP [Sidenote: _Pig and Pepper_]

FOR a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and
wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came
running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he
was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have
called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles STOP It
was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and large
eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair
that curled all over their heads STOP She felt very curious to know what it
was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen STOP The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, "For the Duchess STOP An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet. STOP The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, "From the Queen STOP An
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet. STOP Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together STOP Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
for fear of their hearing her; and, when she next peeped out, the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky STOP Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked STOP "There's no use in knocking," said the Footman, "and that for two
reasons STOP First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are;
secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you. STOP And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise
going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces STOP "Please, then," said Alice, "how am I to get in? STOP "There might be some sense in your knocking," the Footman went on
without attending to her, "if we had the door between us STOP For instance,
if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
know. STOP He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
this Alice thought decidedly uncivil STOP "But perhaps he can't help it,"
she said to herself: "his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
head STOP But at any rate he might answer questions STOP How am I to get in? STOP she repeated aloud STOP "I shall sit here," the Footman remarked, "till to-morrow----"

At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

 STOP ----or next day, maybe," the Footman continued in the same tone,
exactly as if nothing had happened STOP "How am I to get in? STOP asked Alice again in a louder tone STOP "_Are_ you to get in at all? STOP said the Footman STOP "That's the first
question, you know. STOP [Illustration]

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so STOP "It's really
dreadful," she muttered to herself, "the way all the creatures argue STOP It's enough to drive one crazy! STOP The Footman seemed to consider this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations STOP "I shall sit here," he said, "on and off, for
days and days. STOP "But what am _I_ to do? STOP said Alice STOP "Anything you like," said the Footman, and began whistling STOP "Oh, there's no use in talking to him," said Alice desperately: "he's
perfectly idiotic! STOP And she opened the door and went in STOP The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in
the middle, nursing a baby, the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup STOP "There's certainly too much pepper in that soup! STOP Alice said to herself,
as well as she could for sneezing STOP There was certainly too much of it in the air STOP Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and the baby was sneezing and howling alternately without
a moment's pause STOP The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze,
were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and
grinning from ear to ear STOP "Please would you tell me," said Alice a little timidly, for she was not
quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, "why your
cat grins like that? STOP "It's a Cheshire cat," said the Duchess, "and that's why STOP Pig! STOP She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:

"I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know
that cats _could_ grin. STOP "They all can," said the Duchess; "and most of 'em do. STOP "I don't know of any that do," Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation STOP "You don't know much," said the Duchess; "and that's a fact. STOP Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation STOP While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes STOP The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not STOP "Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing! STOP cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror STOP "Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose"; as an
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off STOP "If everybody minded their own business," the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, "the world would go round a deal faster than it does. STOP [Illustration: _An unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very
nearly carried it off_]

"Which would _not_ be an advantage," said Alice, who felt very glad to
get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge STOP "Just think
what work it would make with the day and night STOP You see the earth
takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis----"

"Talking of axes," said the Duchess, "chop off her head. STOP Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily engaged in stirring the soup, and did
not seem to be listening, so she ventured to go on again: "Twenty-four
hours, I _think_; or is it twelve STOP I----"

"Oh, don't bother _me_," said the Duchess; "I never could abide
figures! STOP And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
the end of every line:

          "Speak roughly to your little boy,
            And beat him when he sneezes:
          He only does it to annoy,
            Because he knows it teases. STOP CHORUS

          (In which the cook and the baby joined):
          "Wow STOP wow STOP wow! STOP While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:

          "I speak severely to my boy,
            I beat him when he sneezes;
          For he can thoroughly enjoy
            The pepper when he pleases! STOP CHORUS STOP "Wow STOP wow STOP wow! STOP "Here STOP you may nurse it a bit if you like! STOP the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke STOP "I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen," and she hurried out of the room STOP The cook threw
a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her STOP Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, "just
like a star-fish," thought Alice STOP The poor little thing was snorting
like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and
straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute
or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it STOP As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it up into a knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and
left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into
the open air STOP "If I don't take this child away with me," thought Alice,
"they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave
it behind? STOP She said the last words out loud, and the little thing
grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time) STOP "Don't grunt,"
said Alice; "that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself. STOP The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to
see what was the matter with it STOP There could be no doubt that it had a
_very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its
eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not
like the look of the thing at all STOP "But perhaps it was only sobbing,"
she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any
tears STOP No, there were no tears STOP "If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,"
said Alice, seriously, "I'll have nothing more to do with you STOP Mind
now! STOP The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence STOP Alice was just beginning to think to herself, "Now, what am I to do with
this creature when I get it home? STOP when it grunted again, so violently,
that she looked down into its face in some alarm STOP This time there could
be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and
she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it any further STOP So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
trot quietly away into the wood STOP "If it had grown up," she said to
herself, "it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think. STOP And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, "if one only knew the right way to change them----" when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
tree a few yards off STOP [Illustration: _It grunted again so violently that she looked down into
its face in some alarm_]

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice STOP It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect STOP [Illustration]

"Cheshire Puss," she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider STOP "Come, it's pleased so far," thought Alice, and she went on STOP "Would you
tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here? STOP "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat STOP "I don't much care where----" said Alice STOP "Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.

 STOP ---- so long as I get _somewhere_," Alice added as an explanation STOP "Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long
enough. STOP Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question STOP "What sort of people live about here? STOP "In _that_ direction," the Cat said, waving its right paw round, "lives
a Hatter: and in _that_ direction," waving the other paw, "lives a March
Hare STOP Visit either you like: they're both mad. STOP "But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked STOP "Oh, you ca'n't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here STOP I'm mad STOP You're mad. STOP "How do you know I'm mad? STOP said Alice STOP "You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here. STOP Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on STOP "And how
do you know that you're mad? STOP "To begin with," said the Cat, "a dog's not mad STOP You grant that? STOP "I suppose so," said Alice STOP "Well, then," the Cat went on, "you see a dog growls when it's angry,
and wags its tail when it's pleased STOP Now _I_ growl when I'm pleased, and
wag my tail when I'm angry STOP Therefore I'm mad. STOP "_I_ call it purring, not growling," said Alice STOP "Call it what you like," said the Cat STOP "Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-day? STOP "I should like it very much," said Alice, "but I haven't been invited
yet. STOP "You'll see me there," said the Cat and vanished STOP Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening STOP While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again STOP "By-the-bye, what became of the baby? STOP said the Cat STOP "I'd nearly
forgotten to ask. STOP "It turned into a pig," Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way STOP "I thought it would," said the Cat, and vanished again STOP Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live STOP "I've seen hatters before," she
said to herself; "the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May, it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as
it was in March. STOP As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on the branch of a tree STOP "Did you say pig, or fig? STOP said the Cat STOP "I said pig," replied Alice; "and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and
vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy. STOP "All right," said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone STOP "Well STOP I've often seen a cat without a grin," thought Alice; "but a grin
without a cat STOP It's the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life. STOP [Illustration]

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur STOP It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom, and raised herself,
to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herself, "Suppose it should be raving mad after all STOP I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead! STOP [Sidenote: _A Mad Tea-party_]

THERE was a table set out under a tree in front of the
house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a
Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were
using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it, and talking over its
head STOP "Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice; "only as
it's asleep, suppose it doesn't mind. STOP The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it STOP "No room STOP No room! STOP they cried out when they saw Alice
coming STOP "There's _plenty_ of room! STOP said Alice indignantly, and she sat
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table STOP "Have some wine," the March Hare said in an encouraging tone STOP Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea STOP "I don't see any wine," she remarked STOP "There isn't any," said the March Hare STOP "Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it," said Alice angrily STOP "It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited," said
the March Hare STOP "I didn't know it was _your_ table," said Alice; "it's laid for a great
many more than three. STOP "Your hair wants cutting," said the Hatter STOP He had been looking at Alice
for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech STOP "You should learn not to make personal remarks," Alice said with some
severity; "it's very rude. STOP The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
was "Why is a raven like a writing-desk? STOP "Come, we shall have some fun now! STOP thought Alice STOP "I'm glad they've
begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that," she added aloud STOP "Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it? STOP said
the March Hare STOP "Exactly so," said Alice STOP "Then you should say what you mean," the March Hare went on STOP "I do," Alice hastily replied; "at least--at least I mean what I
say--that's the same thing, you know. STOP "Not the same thing a bit! STOP said the Hatter STOP "Why, you might just as
well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I
see'! STOP "You might just as well say," added the March Hare, "that 'I like what I
get' is the same thing as 'I get what I like'! STOP "You might just as well say," added the Dormouse, which seemed to be
talking in his sleep, "that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing
as 'I sleep when I breathe'! STOP "It _is_ the same thing with you," said the Hatter; and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
which wasn't much STOP [Illustration: _A Mad Tea Party_]

The Hatter was the first to break the silence STOP "What day of the month
is it? STOP he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear STOP Alice considered a little, and then said "The fourth. STOP "Two days wrong! STOP sighed the Hatter STOP "I told you butter would not suit
the works! STOP he added, looking angrily at the March Hare STOP "It was the _best_ butter," the March Hare meekly replied STOP "Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well," the Hatter grumbled:
"you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife. STOP The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, "It was the _best_ butter,
you know. STOP Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity STOP "What a
funny watch! STOP she remarked STOP "It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
tell what o'clock it is! STOP "Why should it? STOP muttered the Hatter STOP "Does _your_ watch tell you what
year it is? STOP "Of course not," Alice replied very readily: "but that's because it
stays the same year for such a long time together. STOP "Which is just the case with _mine_," said the Hatter STOP Alice felt dreadfully puzzled STOP The Hatter's remark seemed to have no
meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English STOP "I don't quite
understand," she said, as politely as she could STOP "The Dormouse is asleep again," said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose STOP The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, "Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself. STOP "Have you guessed the riddle yet? STOP the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again STOP "No, I give it up," Alice replied: "what's the answer? STOP "I haven't the slightest idea," said the Hatter STOP "Nor I," said the March Hare STOP Alice sighed wearily STOP "I think you might do something better with the
time," she said, "than wasting it asking riddles with no answers. STOP "If you knew Time as well as I do," said the Hatter, "you wouldn't talk
about wasting _it_ STOP It's _him_. STOP "I don't know what you mean," said Alice STOP "Of course you don't! STOP the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously STOP "I daresay you never spoke to Time! STOP "Perhaps not," Alice cautiously replied: "but I know I have to beat time
when I learn music. STOP "Ah STOP that accounts for it," said the Hatter STOP "He won't stand beating STOP Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything
you liked with the clock STOP For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling STOP Half-past one,
time for dinner! STOP ("I only wish it was," the March Hare said to itself in a whisper. STOP "That would be grand, certainly," said Alice thoughtfully: "but then--I
shouldn't be hungry for it, you know. STOP "Not at first, perhaps," said the Hatter: "but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked. STOP "Is that the way _you_ manage? STOP Alice asked STOP The Hatter shook his head mournfully STOP "Not I! STOP he replied STOP "We
quarrelled last March----just before _he_ went mad, you know----"
(pointing with his teaspoon to the March Hare), "it was at the great
concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

          'Twinkle, twinkle, little bat STOP How I wonder what you're at! STOP You know that song, perhaps? STOP "I've heard something like it," said Alice STOP "It goes on, you know," the Hatter continued, "in this way:--

          'Up above the world you fly,
          Like a tea-tray in the sky STOP Twinkle, twinkle----'"

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
"_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_----" and went on so long that they
had to pinch it to make it stop STOP "Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse," said the Hatter, "when the
Queen jumped up and bawled out 'He's murdering the time STOP Off with his
head!' STOP "How dreadfully savage! STOP exclaimed Alice STOP "And ever since that," the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, "he won't
do a thing I ask STOP It's always six o'clock now. STOP A bright idea came into Alice's head STOP "Is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here? STOP she asked STOP "Yes, that's it," said the Hatter with a sigh: "it's always tea-time,
and we've no time to wash the things between whiles. STOP "Then you keep moving round, I suppose? STOP said Alice STOP "Exactly so," said the Hatter: "as the things get used up. STOP "But what happens when you come to the beginning again? STOP Alice ventured
to ask STOP "Suppose we change the subject," the March Hare interrupted, yawning STOP "I'm getting tired of this STOP I vote the young lady tells us a story. STOP "I'm afraid I don't know one," said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal STOP "Then the Dormouse shall! STOP they both cried STOP "Wake up, Dormouse! STOP And
they pinched it on both sides at once STOP The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes STOP "I wasn't asleep," he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: "I heard every word you fellows were saying. STOP "Tell us a story! STOP said the March Hare STOP "Yes, please do! STOP pleaded Alice STOP "And be quick about it," added the Hatter, "or you'll be asleep again
before it's done. STOP "Once upon a time there were three little sisters," the Dormouse began
in a great hurry; "and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well----"

"What did they live on? STOP said Alice, who always took a great interest in
questions of eating and drinking STOP "They lived on treacle," said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two STOP "They couldn't have done that, you know," Alice gently remarked; "they'd
have been ill."

"So they were," said the Dormouse; "_very_ ill."

Alice tried a little to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way
of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on:
"But why did they live at the bottom of a well? STOP "Take some more tea," the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly STOP "I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't
take more. STOP "You mean you can't take _less_," said the Hatter; "it's very easy to
take _more_ than nothing. STOP "Nobody asked _your_ opinion," said Alice STOP "Who's making personal remarks now? STOP the Hatter asked triumphantly STOP Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
repeated her question STOP "Why did they live at the bottom of a well? STOP The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, "It was a treacle-well. STOP "There's no such thing! STOP Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went "Sh STOP sh! STOP and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked: "If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
yourself. STOP "No, please go on! STOP Alice said very humbly STOP "I won't interrupt you
again STOP I dare say there may be _one_. STOP "One, indeed! STOP said the Dormouse indignantly STOP However, he consented to
go on STOP "And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
you know----"

"What did they draw? STOP said Alice, quite forgetting her promise STOP "Treacle," said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time STOP "I want a clean cup," interrupted the Hatter: "let's all move one place
on. STOP He moved as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
place of the March Hare STOP The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate STOP Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: "But I don't understand STOP Where did they draw the treacle
from? STOP "You can draw water out of a water-well," said the Hatter; "so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid! STOP "But they were _in_ the well," Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
to notice this last remark STOP "Of course they were," said the Dormouse; "----well in. STOP This answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it STOP "They were learning to draw," the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; "and they drew all manner of
things--everything that begins with an M----"

"Why with an M? STOP said Alice STOP "Why not? STOP said the March Hare STOP Alice was silent STOP The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
dose; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
little shriek, and went on: "----that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say
things are 'much of a muchness'--did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness? STOP "Really, now you ask me," said Alice, very much confused, "I don't
think----"

"Then you shouldn't talk," said the Hatter STOP This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot STOP "At any rate I'll never go _there_ again! STOP said Alice as she picked her
way through the wood STOP "It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all
my life! STOP Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it STOP "That's very curious! STOP she thought STOP "But
everything's curious to-day STOP I think I may as well go in at once. STOP And
in she went STOP Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
glass table STOP "Now I'll manage better this time," she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden STOP Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she
had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:
then she walked down the little passage: and _then_--she found herself
at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the
cool fountains STOP [Sidenote: _The Queen's Croquet-Ground_]

A LARGE rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:
the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at
it, busily painting them red STOP Alice thought this a very curious thing,
and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she
heard one of them say "Look out now, Five STOP Don't go splashing paint over
me like that! STOP "I couldn't help it," said Five, in a sulky tone STOP "Seven jogged my
elbow. STOP On which Seven looked up and said, "That's right, Five STOP Always lay the
blame on others! STOP "_You'd_ better not talk! STOP said Five STOP "I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded! STOP "What for? STOP said the one who had first spoken STOP "That's none of _your_ business, Two! STOP said Seven STOP "Yes, it _is_ his business! STOP said Five STOP "And I'll tell him--it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions. STOP Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun "Well, of all the unjust
things----" when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood
watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round
also, and all of them bowed low STOP "Would you tell me," said Alice, a little timidly, "why you are painting
those roses? STOP Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two STOP Two began in a low
voice, "Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know STOP So
you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to----" At this
moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out "The Queen STOP The Queen! STOP and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces STOP There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen STOP First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did STOP After these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples; they were all ornamented
with hearts STOP Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among
them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried,
nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her STOP Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's
crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and last of all this grand
procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS STOP Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; "and besides, what would be the use of a
procession," thought she, "if people had to lie down upon their faces,
so that they couldn't see it? STOP So she stood still where she was, and
waited STOP When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely, "Who is this? STOP She said it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply STOP "Idiot! STOP said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and turning to
Alice, she went on, "What's your name, child? STOP "My name is Alice, so please your Majesty," said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, "Why, they're only a pack of cards, after
all STOP I needn't be afraid of them! STOP "And who are _these_? STOP said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners
who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on
their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,
or courtiers, or three of her own children STOP "How should _I_ know? STOP said Alice, surprised at her own courage STOP "It's
no business of _mine_. STOP The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed "Off with her head STOP Off----"

"Nonsense! STOP said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
silent STOP The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said "Consider my dear:
she is only a child! STOP The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave "Turn them
over! STOP The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot STOP "Get up! STOP said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else STOP "Leave off that! STOP screamed the Queen STOP "You make me giddy. STOP And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, "What _have_ you been doing
here? STOP "May it please your Majesty," said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, "we were trying----"

[Illustration: _The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the
Knave, "Turn them over"_]

"_I_ see! STOP said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses STOP "Off with their heads! STOP and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection STOP "You shan't be beheaded! STOP said Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near STOP The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others STOP "Are their heads off? STOP shouted the Queen STOP "Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty! STOP the soldiers shouted
in reply STOP "That's right! STOP shouted the Queen STOP "Can you play croquet? STOP The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her STOP "Yes! STOP shouted Alice STOP "Come on, then! STOP roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next STOP "It's--it's a very fine day! STOP said a timid voice at her side STOP She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face STOP "Very," said Alice: "----where's the Duchess? STOP "Hush STOP Hush! STOP said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone STOP He looked anxiously
over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put
his mouth close to her ear, and whispered "She's under sentence of
execution. STOP "What for? STOP said Alice STOP "Did you say 'What a pity!'? STOP the Rabbit asked STOP "No, I didn't," said Alice: "I don't think it's at all a pity STOP I said
'What for?' STOP "She boxed the Queen's ears--" the Rabbit began STOP Alice gave a little
scream of laughter STOP "Oh, hush! STOP the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone STOP "The Queen will hear you STOP You see she came rather late, and the
Queen said----"

"Get to your places! STOP shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began STOP Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
all her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and to stand upon their hands and feet, to make the
arches STOP [Illustration]

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo;
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under
her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got
its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a
blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look up in her
face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting
out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to
begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had
unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,
there was generally a ridge or a furrow in the way wherever she wanted
to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always
getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came
to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed STOP The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting "Off with his head! STOP or "Off with her head! STOP about once in a
minute STOP Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure she had not as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
"and then," thought she, "what would become of me STOP They're dreadfully
fond of beheading people here: the great wonder is that there's any one
left alive! STOP She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
to herself "It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
to. STOP "How are you getting on? STOP said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with STOP Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded STOP "It's no use
speaking to it," she thought, "till its ears have come, or at least one
of them. STOP In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had some one to listen to her STOP The Cat seemed to think that there
was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared STOP "I don't think they play at all fairly," Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, "and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at
least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the
arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming! STOP [Illustration]

"How do you like the Queen? STOP said the Cat in a low voice STOP "Not at all," said Alice: "she's so extremely----" Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her listening: so she went on,
"----likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game. STOP The Queen smiled and passed on STOP "Who _are_ you talking to? STOP said the King, coming up to Alice, and
looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity STOP "It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat," said Alice: "allow me to
introduce it. STOP "I don't like the look of it at all," said the King: "however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes. STOP "I'd rather not," the Cat remarked STOP "Don't be impertinent," said the King, "and don't look at me like that! STOP He got behind Alice as he spoke STOP "A cat may look at a king," said Alice STOP "I've read that in some book,
but I don't remember where. STOP "Well, it must be removed," said the King very decidedly, and he called
to the Queen, who was passing at the moment, "My dear STOP I wish you would
have this cat removed! STOP The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small STOP "Off with his head! STOP she said, without even looking round STOP "I'll fetch the executioner myself," said the King eagerly, and he
hurried off STOP Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with
passion STOP She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of
things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not STOP So she went in search of her hedgehog STOP The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the
other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless
sort of way to fly up into one of the trees STOP By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: "but it doesn't
matter much," thought Alice, "as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground. STOP So she tucked it under her arm, that it might not escape
again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend STOP When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a
large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the
executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable STOP The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said STOP [Illustration]

The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at _his_ time of life STOP The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense STOP The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less
than no time, she'd have everybody executed all round STOP (It was this last
remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious. STOP Alice could think of nothing else to say but "It belongs to the Duchess:
you'd better ask _her_ about it. STOP "She's in prison," the Queen said to the executioner; "fetch her here. STOP And the executioner went off like an arrow STOP The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and by the time
he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the
King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while
the rest of the party went back to the game STOP [Sidenote: _The Mock Turtle's Story_]

"YOU can't think how glad I am to see you again, you
dear old thing! STOP said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately
into Alice's, and they walked off together STOP Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen STOP "When _I'm_ a Duchess," she said to herself (not in a very hopeful tone
though), "I won't have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_ STOP Soup does very
well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,"
she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule,
"and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes them
bitter--and--barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered STOP I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn't be
so stingy about it, you know----"

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear STOP "You're thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk STOP I can't
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit. STOP "Perhaps it hasn't one," Alice ventured to remark STOP "Tut, tut, child! STOP said the Duchess STOP "Every thing's got a moral, if only
you can find it. STOP And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
she spoke STOP Alice did not much like her keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right
height to rest her chin on Alice's shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably
sharp chin STOP However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well
as she could STOP "The game's going on rather better now," she said, by way
of keeping up the conversation a little STOP "'Tis so," said the Duchess: "and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love,
'tis love, that makes the world go round!' STOP "Somebody said," Alice whispered, "that it's done by everybody minding
their own business! STOP "Ah, well STOP It means much the same thing," said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, "and the moral of
_that_ is--'Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.' STOP "How fond she is of finding morals in things! STOP Alice thought to herself STOP "I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,"
the Duchess said after a pause: "the reason is, that I'm doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo STOP Shall I try the experiment? STOP "He might bite," Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to
have the experiment tried STOP "Very true," said the Duchess: "flamingoes and mustard both bite STOP And
the moral of that is--'Birds of a feather flock together.' STOP "Only mustard isn't a bird," Alice remarked STOP "Right, as usual," said the Duchess: "what a clear way you have of
putting things! STOP "It's a mineral, I _think_," said Alice STOP "Of course it is," said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said: "there's a large mustard-mine near here STOP And
the moral of that is--'The more there is of mine, the less there is of
yours.' STOP "Oh, I know! STOP exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark STOP "It's a vegetable STOP It doesn't look like one, but it is. STOP "I quite agree with you," said the Duchess; "and the moral of that
is--'Be what you would seem to be'--or if you'd like it put more
simply--'Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.' STOP "I think I should understand that better," Alice said very politely, "if
I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it. STOP "That's nothing to what I could say if I chose," the Duchess replied, in
a pleased tone STOP "Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that," said
Alice STOP "Oh, don't talk about trouble! STOP said the Duchess STOP "I make you a present
of everything I've said as yet. STOP "A cheap sort of present! STOP thought Alice STOP "I'm glad they don't give
birthday presents like that! STOP But she did not venture to say it out
loud STOP "Thinking again? STOP the Duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little
chin STOP "I've a right to think," said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried STOP "Just about as much right," said the Duchess, "as pigs have to fly; and
the m----"

But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even
in the middle of her favourite word "moral," and the arm that was linked
into hers began to tremble STOP Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen
in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm STOP "A fine day, your Majesty! STOP the Duchess began in a low, weak voice STOP "Now, I give you fair warning," shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; "either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time STOP Take your choice! STOP The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment STOP "Let's go on with the game," the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground STOP The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would
cost them their lives STOP [Illustration: _The Queen never left off quarrelling with the other
players, and shouting "Off with his head! STOP or, "Off with her head STOP "_]

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with
the other players, and shouting "Off with his head! STOP or "Off with her
head! STOP Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,
who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the
end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the
players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and
under sentence of execution STOP Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, "Have
you seen the Mock Turtle yet? STOP "No," said Alice STOP "I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is. STOP "It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from," said the Queen STOP "I never saw one, or heard of one," said Alice STOP "Come on then," said the Queen, "and he shall tell you his history. STOP As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to
the company generally, "You are all pardoned. STOP "Come, _that's_ a good
thing! STOP she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the Queen had ordered STOP They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun STOP (If
you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture. STOP "Up, lazy
thing! STOP said the Queen, "and take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history STOP I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered," and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
with the Gryphon STOP Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but
on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to
go after that savage Queen: so she waited STOP The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled STOP "What fun! STOP said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice STOP "What _is_ the fun? STOP said Alice STOP "Why, _she_," said the Gryphon STOP "It's all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know STOP Come on! STOP "Everybody says 'come on! STOP here," thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it: "I never was so ordered about in my life, never! STOP [Illustration]

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break STOP She
pitied him deeply STOP "What is his sorrow? STOP she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, "It's all
his fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know STOP Come on! STOP So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing STOP "This here young lady," said the Gryphon, "she wants to know your
history, she do. STOP "I'll tell it her," said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone; "sit
down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished. STOP So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes STOP Alice thought to
herself, "I don't see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn't begin. STOP But she waited patiently STOP "Once," said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, "I was a real
Turtle. STOP These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of "Hjckrrh! STOP from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle STOP Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying "Thank you, sir, for your interesting story," but she could not
help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing STOP "When we were little," the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, "we went to school in the
sea STOP The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise----"

"Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one? STOP Alice asked STOP "We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the Mock Turtle
angrily: "really you are very dull! STOP "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,"
added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth STOP At last the Gryphon said
to the Mock Turtle, "Drive on, old fellow STOP Don't be all day about it! STOP and he went on in these words:

"Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it----"

"I never said I didn't! STOP interrupted Alice STOP "You did," said the Mock Turtle STOP "Hold your tongue! STOP added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again STOP The Mock Turtle went on:--

"We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every
day----"

"_I've_ been to a day-school, too," said Alice; "you needn't be so proud
as all that. STOP "With extras? STOP asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously STOP "Yes," said Alice, "we learned French and music. STOP "And washing? STOP said the Mock Turtle STOP "Certainly not! STOP said Alice indignantly STOP "Ah STOP then yours wasn't a really good school," said the Mock Turtle in a
tone of relief STOP "Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill, 'French,
music, _and washing_--extra.' STOP "You couldn't have wanted it much," said Alice; "living at the bottom of
the sea. STOP "I couldn't afford to learn it," said the Mock Turtle with a sigh STOP "I
only took the regular course. STOP "What was that? STOP inquired Alice STOP "Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with," the Mock Turtle
replied; "and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. STOP "I never heard of 'Uglification,'" Alice ventured to say STOP "What is it? STOP The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise STOP "Never heard of
uglifying! STOP it exclaimed STOP "You know what to beautify is, I suppose? STOP "Yes," said Alice doubtfully: "it means--to--make--anything--prettier. STOP "Well, then," the Gryphon went on, "if you don't know what to uglify is,
you are a simpleton. STOP Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
turned to the Mock Turtle and said, "What else had you to learn? STOP "Well, there was Mystery," the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
subjects on his flappers, "--Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils. STOP "What was _that_ like? STOP said Alice STOP "Well, I can't show it you myself," the Mock Turtle said: "I'm too
stiff STOP And the Gryphon never learnt it. STOP "Hadn't time," said the Gryphon: "I went to the Classical master,
though STOP He was an old crab, _he_ was. STOP "I never went to him," the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: "he taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say. STOP "So he did, so he did," said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws STOP "And how many hours a day did you do lessons? STOP said Alice, in a hurry to
change the subject STOP "Ten hours the first day," said the Mock Turtle: "nine the next, and so
on. STOP "What a curious plan! STOP exclaimed Alice STOP "That's the reason they're called lessons," the Gryphon remarked:
"because they lessen from day to day. STOP This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought over it a little
before she made her next remark STOP "Then the eleventh day must have been a
holiday. STOP "Of course it was," said the Mock Turtle STOP "And how did you manage on the twelfth? STOP Alice went on eagerly STOP "That's enough about lessons," the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided
tone: "tell her something about the games now. STOP [Sidenote: _The Lobster Quadrille_]

THE Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one
flapper across his eyes STOP He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but,
for a minute or two, sobs choked his voice STOP "Same as if he had a bone in
his throat," said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and
punching him in the back STOP At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice,
and, with tears running down his cheeks, went on again:

"You may not have lived much under the sea--" ("I haven't," said Alice)
"and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--" (Alice began
to say "I once tasted----" but checked herself hastily, and said "No,
never") "--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster
Quadrille is! STOP "No, indeed," said Alice STOP "What sort of a dance is it? STOP "Why," said the Gryphon, "you first form into a line along the
sea-shore----"

"Two lines! STOP cried the Mock Turtle STOP "Seals, turtles, and so on; then,
when you've cleared the jelly-fish out of the way----"

"_That_ generally takes some time," interrupted the Gryphon.

 STOP --you advance twice----"

"Each with a lobster as a partner! STOP cried the Gryphon STOP "Of course," the Mock Turtle said: "advance twice, set to partners----"

"--change lobsters, and retire in same order," continued the Gryphon STOP "Then, you know," the Mock Turtle went on, "you throw the----"

"The lobsters! STOP shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

 STOP --as far out to sea as you can----"

"Swim, after them! STOP screamed the Gryphon STOP "Turn a somersault in the sea! STOP cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about STOP "Change lobsters again! STOP yelled the Gryphon STOP "Back to land again, and--that's all the first figure," said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been
jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly
and quietly, and looked at Alice STOP "It must be a very pretty dance," said Alice, timidly STOP "Would you like to see a little of it? STOP said the Mock Turtle STOP "Very much indeed," said Alice STOP "Come, let's try the first figure! STOP said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon STOP "We can do it without lobsters, you know STOP Which shall sing? STOP "Oh, _you_ sing," said the Gryphon STOP "I've forgotten the words. STOP So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then
treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:--

  "Will you walk a little faster? STOP said a whiting to a snail,
  "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail STOP See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance STOP They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance STOP Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance STOP Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance STOP "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be,
  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea! STOP But the snail replied: "Too far, too far! STOP and gave a look askance--
  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance STOP Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance STOP Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance STOP "What matters it how far we go? STOP his scaly friend replied;
  "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side STOP The further off from England the nearer is to France--
  Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance STOP Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance STOP Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance? STOP "Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch," said Alice, feeling
very glad that it was over at last: "and I do so like that curious song
about the whiting! STOP "Oh, as to the whiting," said the Mock Turtle, "they--you've seen them,
of course? STOP "Yes," said Alice, "I've often seen them at dinn----" she checked
herself hastily STOP "I don't know where Dinn may be," said the Mock Turtle, "but if you've
seen them so often, of course you know what they're like. STOP "I believe so," Alice replied thoughtfully STOP "They have their tails in
their mouths--and they're all over crumbs. STOP "You're wrong about the crumbs," said the Mock Turtle: "crumbs would all
wash off in the sea STOP But they _have_ their tails in their mouths; and
the reason is--" here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes STOP "Tell
her about the reason and all that," he said to the Gryphon STOP "The reason is," said the Gryphon, "that they _would_ go with the
lobsters to the dance STOP So they got thrown out to sea STOP So they had to
fall a long way STOP So they got their tails fast in their mouths STOP So they
couldn't get them out again STOP That's all. STOP "Thank you," said Alice STOP "It's very interesting STOP I never knew so much
about a whiting before. STOP "I can tell you more than that, if you like," said the Gryphon STOP "Do you
know why it's called a whiting? STOP "I never thought about it," said Alice STOP "Why? STOP "_It does the boots and shoes_," the Gryphon replied very solemnly STOP Alice was thoroughly puzzled STOP "Does the boots and shoes! STOP she repeated
in a wondering tone STOP "Why, what are _your_ shoes done with? STOP said the Gryphon STOP "I mean, what
makes them so shiny? STOP Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer STOP "They're done with blacking, I believe. STOP "Boots and shoes under the sea," the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
"are done with whiting STOP Now you know. STOP "And what are they made of? STOP Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity STOP "Soles and eels, of course," the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
"any shrimp could have told you that. STOP "If I'd been the whiting," said Alice, whose thoughts were still running
on the song, "I'd have said to the porpoise, 'Keep back, please: we
don't want _you_ with us!' STOP "They were obliged to have him with them," the Mock Turtle said: "no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise. STOP "Wouldn't it really? STOP said Alice in a tone of great surprise STOP "Of course not," said the Mock Turtle: "why, if a fish came to _me_, and
told me he was going a journey, I should say, 'With what porpoise?' STOP "Don't you mean 'purpose'? STOP said Alice STOP "I mean what I say," the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone STOP And
the Gryphon added, "Come, let's hear some of _your_ adventures. STOP [Illustration: _The Mock Turtle drew a long breath and said, "That's
very curious"_]

"I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning," said
Alice a little timidly: "but it's no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then. STOP "Explain all that," said the Mock Turtle STOP "No, no STOP The adventures first," said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
"explanations take such a dreadful time. STOP So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the White Rabbit STOP She was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she went
on STOP Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
her repeating "_You are old, Father William_," to the Caterpillar, and
the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long
breath, and said, "That's very curious. STOP "It's all about as curious as it can be," said the Gryphon STOP "It all came different! STOP the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully STOP "I
should like to hear her repeat something now STOP Tell her to begin. STOP He
looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority
over Alice STOP "Stand up and repeat '_'Tis the voice of the sluggard_,'" said the
Gryphon STOP "How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons! STOP thought Alice STOP "I might as well be at school at once. STOP However, she got
up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:--

          "'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
          'You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair. STOP As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
          Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes STOP When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
          And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark:
          But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
          His voice has a timid and tremulous sound. STOP "That's different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child," said
the Gryphon STOP "Well, _I_ never heard it before," said the Mock Turtle: "but it sounds
uncommon nonsense. STOP Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again STOP "I should like to have it explained," said the Mock Turtle STOP "She ca'n't explain it," hastily said the Gryphon STOP "Go on with the next
verse. STOP "But about his toes? STOP the Mock Turtle persisted STOP "How _could_ he turn
them out with his nose, you know? STOP "It's the first position in dancing," Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject STOP "Go on with the next verse," the Gryphon repeated: "it begins '_I passed
by his garden_.' STOP Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:

          "I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
          How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie:
          The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
          While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat STOP When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
          Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
          While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
          And concluded the banquet by----"

"What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff," the Mock Turtle
interrupted, "if you don't explain it as you go on STOP It's by far the most
confusing thing _I_ ever heard! STOP [Illustration]

"Yes, I think you'd better leave off," said the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so STOP "Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille? STOP the Gryphon went
on STOP "Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you another song? STOP "Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind," Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
"H'm STOP No accounting for tastes STOP Sing her '_Turtle Soup_,' will you, old
fellow? STOP The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice choked with sobs,
to sing this:--

          "Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,

to repeat it, when a cry of "The trial's beginning! STOP was heard in the
distance STOP "Come on! STOP cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song STOP "What trial is it? STOP Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
answered "Come on! STOP and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--

THE King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne
when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of
little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave
was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to
guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other STOP In the very middle of the
court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--"I wish they'd
get the trial done," she thought, "and hand round the refreshments! STOP But
there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking about her, to
pass away the time STOP Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the
name of nearly everything there STOP "That's the judge," she said to
herself, "because of his great wig. STOP The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
wig, he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not
becoming STOP "And that's the jury-box," thought Alice, "and those twelve creatures,"
(she was obliged to say "creatures," you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds,) "I suppose they are the jurors. STOP She said
this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of
it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her
age knew the meaning of it at all STOP However, "jurymen" would have done
just as well STOP The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates STOP "What are they
all doing? STOP Alice whispered to the Gryphon STOP "They can't have anything to
put down yet, before the trial's begun. STOP [Illustration: _Who stole the tarts?_]

"They're putting down their names," the Gryphon whispered in reply,
"for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial. STOP "Stupid things! STOP Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out "Silence in the court! STOP and the
King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to see who was
talking STOP Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down "stupid things! STOP on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell
"stupid," and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him STOP "A nice
muddle their slates will be in before the trial's over! STOP thought Alice STOP One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked STOP This, of course, Alice
could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away STOP She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he
was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this
was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate STOP "Herald, read the accusation! STOP said the King STOP On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:

          "The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
              All on a summer day:
          The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
              And took them quite away! STOP "Consider your verdict," the King said to the jury STOP "Not yet, not yet! STOP the Rabbit hastily interrupted STOP "There's a great
deal to come before that! STOP "Call the first witness," said the King; and the Rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet, and called out "First witness! STOP The first witness was the Hatter STOP He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other STOP "I beg pardon, your
Majesty," he began, "for bringing these in; but I hadn't quite finished
my tea when I was sent for. STOP "You ought to have finished," said the King STOP "When did you begin? STOP The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse STOP "Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was," he said STOP "Fifteenth," said the March Hare STOP "Sixteenth," said the Dormouse STOP "Write that down," the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote
down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence STOP "Take off your hat," the King said to the Hatter STOP "It isn't mine," said the Hatter STOP "_Stolen!_" the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact STOP "I keep them to sell," the Hatter added as an explanation: "I've none of
my own STOP I'm a hatter. STOP Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring hard at the
Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted STOP "Give your evidence," said the King; "and don't be nervous, or I'll have
you executed on the spot. STOP This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from
one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter STOP Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her STOP "I wish you wouldn't squeeze so," said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her STOP "I can hardly breathe. STOP "I can't help it," said Alice very meekly: "I'm growing. STOP "You've no right to grow _here_," said the Dormouse STOP "Don't talk nonsense," said Alice more boldly: "you know you're growing
too. STOP "Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace," said the Dormouse; "not in
that ridiculous fashion. STOP And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to
the other side of the court STOP All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, "Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert! STOP on
which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook off both his shoes STOP "Give your evidence," the King repeated angrily, "or I'll have you
executed, whether you're nervous or not. STOP "I'm a poor man, your Majesty," the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
"--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea----"

"The twinkling of _what_? STOP said the King STOP "It _began_ with the tea," the Hatter replied STOP "Of course twinkling _begins_ with a T! STOP said the King sharply STOP "Do you
take me for a dunce STOP Go on! STOP "I'm a poor man," the Hatter went on, "and most things twinkled after
that--only the March Hare said----"

"I didn't! STOP the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry STOP "You did! STOP said the Hatter STOP "I deny it! STOP said the March Hare STOP "He denies it," said the King: "leave out that part. STOP "Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said----" the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep STOP "After that," continued the Hatter, "I cut some more
bread-and-butter----"

"But what did the Dormouse say? STOP one of the jury asked STOP "That I can't remember," said the Hatter STOP "You _must_ remember," remarked the King, "or I'll have you executed. STOP The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee STOP "I'm a poor man, your Majesty," he began STOP "You're a _very_ poor _speaker_," said the King STOP Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court STOP (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done STOP They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it. STOP "I'm glad I've seen that done," thought Alice STOP "I've so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, 'There was some attempt at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,' and I never understood what it meant till now. STOP "If that's all you know about it, you may stand down," continued the
King STOP "I can't go no lower," said the Hatter: "I'm on the floor, as it is. STOP "Then you may _sit_ down," the King replied STOP Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed STOP "Come, that finishes the guinea-pigs! STOP thought Alice STOP "Now we shall get
on better. STOP "I'd rather finish my tea," said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
the Queen, who was reading the list of singers STOP "You may go," said the King; and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.

 STOP --and just take his head off outside," the Queen added to one of the
officers; but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door STOP "Call the next witness! STOP said the King STOP The next witness was the Duchess's cook STOP She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once STOP "Give your evidence," said the King STOP "Sha'n't," said the cook STOP The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness. STOP "Well, if I must, I must," the King said with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, "What are tarts made of? STOP "Pepper, mostly," said the cook STOP "Treacle," said a sleepy voice behind her STOP "Collar that Dormouse," the Queen shrieked out STOP "Behead that Dormouse STOP Turn that Dormouse out of court STOP Suppress him STOP Pinch him STOP Off with his
whiskers. STOP For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared STOP [Illustration]

"Never mind! STOP said the King, with an air of great relief STOP "Call the next
witness. STOP And he added in an undertone to the Queen, "Really, my dear,
_you_ must cross-examine the next witness STOP It quite makes my forehead
ache! STOP Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
curious to see what the next witness would be like, "--for they haven't
got much evidence _yet_," she said to herself STOP Imagine her surprise,
when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice,
the name "Alice! STOP [Sidenote: _Alice's Evidence_]

"HERE! STOP cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of
the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the
edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the
crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much
of a globe of gold-fish she had accidentally upset the week before STOP "Oh, I _beg_ your pardon! STOP she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
the gold-fish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea
that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
they would die STOP "The trial cannot proceed," said the King in a very grave voice, "until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places--_all_," he repeated
with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so STOP Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move STOP She soon got
it out again, and put it right; "not that it signifies much," she said
to herself; "I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the trial
one way up as the other. STOP As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court STOP "What do you know about this business? STOP the King said to Alice STOP "Nothing," said Alice STOP "Nothing _whatever_? STOP persisted the King STOP "Nothing whatever," said Alice STOP "That's very important," the King said, turning to the jury STOP They were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit
interrupted: "_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course," he said in
a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he
spoke STOP "_Un_important, of course, I meant," the King hastily said, and went on
himself in an undertone,"important--unimportant--unimportant--important----"
as if he were trying which word sounded best STOP Some of the jury wrote it down "important," and some "unimportant. STOP Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
"but it doesn't matter a bit," she thought to herself STOP At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, called out "Silence! STOP and read out from his book, "Rule
Forty-two STOP _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court._"

Everybody looked at Alice STOP "_I'm_ not a mile high," said Alice STOP "You are," said the King STOP "Nearly two miles high," added the Queen STOP "Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate," said Alice: "besides, that's not a
regular rule: you invented it just now. STOP "It's the oldest rule in the book," said the King STOP "Then it ought to be Number One," said Alice STOP The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily STOP "Consider your
verdict," he said to the jury, in a low trembling voice STOP "There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty," said the White
Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry: "this paper has just been picked
up. STOP "What's in it? STOP said the Queen STOP "I haven't opened it yet," said the White Rabbit, "but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody. STOP "It must have been that," said the King, "unless it was written to
nobody, which isn't usual, you know. STOP "Who is it directed to? STOP said one of the jurymen STOP "It isn't directed at all," said the White Rabbit; "in fact, there's
nothing written on the _outside_. STOP He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
and added "It isn't a letter after all: it's a set of verses. STOP "Are they in the prisoner's handwriting? STOP asked another of the jurymen STOP "No, they're not," said the White Rabbit, "and that's the queerest thing
about it. STOP (The jury all looked puzzled. STOP "He must have imitated somebody else's hand," said the King STOP (The jury
all brightened up again. STOP "Please your Majesty," said the Knave, "I didn't write it, and they
can't prove that I did: there's no name signed at the end. STOP "If you didn't sign it," said the King, "that only makes the matter
worse STOP You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed
your name like an honest man. STOP There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day STOP "That _proves_ his guilt, of course," said the Queen: "so, off with----"

"It doesn't prove anything of the sort! STOP said Alice STOP "Why, you don't
even know what they're about! STOP "Read them," said the King STOP The White Rabbit put on his spectacles STOP "Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty? STOP he asked STOP "Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on till you
come to the end; then stop. STOP There was dead silence in the court, whilst the White Rabbit read out
these verses:--

          "They told me you had been to her,
             And mentioned me to him:
           She gave me a good character,
             But said I could not swim STOP He sent them word I had not gone,
             (We know it to be true):
           If she should push the matter on,
             What would become of you STOP I gave her one, they gave him two,
             You gave us three or more;
           They all returned from him to you,
             Though they were mine before STOP If I or she should chance to be
             Involved in this affair,
           He trusts to you to set them free,
             Exactly as we were STOP My notion was that you had been
             (Before she had this fit)
           An obstacle that came between
             Him, and ourselves, and it STOP Don't let him know she liked them best,
             For this must ever be
           A secret, kept from all the rest,
             Between yourself and me. STOP "That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet," said the
King, rubbing his hands; "so now let the jury----"

"If any of them can explain it," said Alice, (she had grown so large in
the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,)
"I'll give him sixpence STOP _I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in
it. STOP The jury all wrote down on their slates, "_She_ doesn't believe there's
an atom of meaning in it," but none of them attempted to explain the
paper STOP "If there's no meaning in it," said the King, "that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any STOP And yet I don't
know," he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
them with one eye; "I seem to see some meaning in them after all.
 STOP ----_said I could not swim_--' you can't swim can you? STOP he added,
turning to the Knave STOP The Knave shook his head sadly STOP "Do I look like it? STOP he said STOP (Which he
certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard. STOP "All right, so far," said the King, as he went on muttering over the
verses to himself: "'_We know it to be true_--' that's the jury, of
course--'_If she should push the matter on_'--that must be the
Queen--'_What would become of you?_'--What, indeed!--'_I gave her one,
they gave him two_--' why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you
know----"

"But it goes on '_they all returned from him to you_,'" said Alice STOP "Why, there they are! STOP said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts
on the table STOP "Nothing can be clearer than _that_ STOP Then again--'_before
she had this fit_--' you never had _fits_, my dear, I think? STOP he said to
the Queen STOP "Never! STOP said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke STOP (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as
it lasted. STOP "Then the words don't _fit_ you," said the King, looking round the court
with a smile STOP There was a dead silence STOP "It's a pun! STOP the King added in an angry tone, and everybody laughed STOP "Let the jury consider their verdict," the King said, for about the
twentieth time that day STOP "No, no! STOP said the Queen STOP "Sentence first--verdict afterwards. STOP "Stuff and nonsense! STOP said Alice loudly STOP "The idea of having the
sentence first! STOP "Hold your tongue! STOP said the Queen, turning purple STOP "I won't! STOP said Alice STOP "Off with her head! STOP the Queen shouted at the top of her voice STOP Nobody
moved STOP "Who cares for _you_? STOP said Alice (she had grown to her full size by
this time) STOP "You're nothing but a pack of cards! STOP [Illustration: _At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came
flying down upon her_]

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face STOP "Wake up, Alice dear! STOP said her sister STOP "Why, what a long sleep you've
had! STOP "Oh, I've had such a curious dream! STOP said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures
of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
finished, her sister kissed her, and said "It _was_ a curious dream,
dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late. STOP So
Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been STOP BUT her sister sat still just as she had left her, leaning her head,
watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her
wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
this was her dream:

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
_would_ always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed
to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange
creatures of her little sister's dream STOP The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchess' knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle STOP So she sat on with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland,
though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to
dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool
rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change
to the tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice
of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the
Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the
confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle
in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs STOP Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,
and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps
even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel
with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple
joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days STOP THE END

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on
the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had
peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
pictures or conversations in it, and where is the use of a book,
thought Alice, without pictures or conversations STOP So she was
considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for the hot
day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure
of making a daisy-chain was worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close
by her STOP There was nothing very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it
so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself
"dear, dear STOP I shall be too late! STOP (when she thought it over
afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at
this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the
rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, looked
at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it
flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit
with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and,
full of curiosity, she hurried across the field after it, and was
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
hedge STOP In a moment down went Alice after it, never once
considering how in the world she was to get out again STOP The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and
then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly, that Alice had not a
moment to think about stopping herself, before she found herself
falling down what seemed a deep well STOP Either the well was very
deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she
went down to look about her, and to wonder what would happen
next STOP First, she tried to look down and make out what she was
coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then, she looked
at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves: here and there were maps and pictures
hung on pegs STOP She took a jar down off one of the shelves as she
passed: it was labelled "Orange Marmalade," but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar,
for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it
into one of the cupboards as she fell past it STOP "Well! STOP thought Alice to herself, "after such a fall as this, I
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs STOP How brave they'll
all think me at home STOP Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even
if I fell off the top of the house! STOP (which was most likely
true. STOP Down, down, down STOP Would the fall never come to an end STOP "I wonder
how many miles I've fallen by this time? STOP she said aloud, "I must
be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth STOP Let me see:
that would be four thousand miles down, I think--" (for you see
Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in
the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity
of showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to hear her,
still it was good practice to say it over,) "yes that's the right
distance, but then what Longitude or Latitude-line shall I be
in? STOP (Alice had no idea what Longitude was, or Latitude either,
but she thought they were nice grand words to say. STOP Presently she began again: "I wonder if I shall fall right
through the earth STOP How funny it'll be to come out among the
people that walk with their heads downwards STOP But I shall have to
ask them what the name of the country is, you know STOP Please,
Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia? STOP --and she tried to
curtsey as she spoke (fancy curtseying as you're falling through
the air STOP do you think you could manage it? STOP "and what an ignorant
little girl she'll think me for asking STOP No, it'll never do to
ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere. STOP Down, down, down: there was nothing else to do, so Alice soon
began talking again STOP "Dinah will miss me very much tonight, I
should think! STOP (Dinah was the cat. STOP "I hope they'll remember her
saucer of milk at tea-time STOP Oh, dear Dinah, I wish I had you
here STOP There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might
catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know, my dear STOP But
do cats eat bats, I wonder? STOP And here Alice began to get rather
sleepy, and kept on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way
"do cats eat bats STOP do cats eat bats? STOP and sometimes, "do bats
eat cats? STOP for, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't
much matter which way she put it STOP She felt that she was dozing
off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in
hand with Dinah, and was saying to her very earnestly, "Now,
Dinah, my dear, tell me the truth STOP Did you ever eat a bat? STOP when
suddenly, bump STOP bump STOP down she came upon a heap of sticks and
shavings, and the fall was over STOP Alice was not a bit hurt, and jumped on to her feet directly: she
looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying
down it STOP There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like
the wind, and just heard it say, as it turned a corner, "my ears
and whiskers, how late it's getting! STOP She turned the corner after
it, and instantly found herself in a long, low hall, lit up by a
row of lamps which hung from the roof STOP [Illustration]

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked,
and when Alice had been all round it, and tried them all, she
walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get
out again: suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table,
all made of solid glass; there was nothing lying upon it, but a
tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that it might belong
to one of the doors of the hall, but alas STOP either the locks were
too large, or the key too small, but at any rate it would open
none of them STOP However, on the second time round, she came to a
low curtain, behind which was a door about eighteen inches high:
she tried the little key in the keyhole, and it fitted STOP Alice
opened the door, and looked down a small passage, not larger than
a rat-hole, into the loveliest garden you ever saw STOP How she
longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those
beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could
not even get her head through the doorway, "and even if my head
would go through," thought poor Alice, "it would be very little
use without my shoulders STOP Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a
telescope STOP I think I could, if I only knew how to begin. STOP For,
you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that
Alice began to think very few things indeed were really
impossible STOP There was nothing else to do, so she went back to the table, half
hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of
rules for shutting up people like telescopes: this time there was
a little bottle on it--"which certainly was not there before"
said Alice--and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label with the words DRINK ME beautifully printed on it in large
letters STOP It was all very well to say "drink me," "but I'll look first,"
said the wise little Alice, "and see whether the bottle's marked
"poison" or not," for Alice had read several nice little stories
about children that got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and
other unpleasant things, because they would not remember the
simple rules their friends had given them, such as, that, if you
get into the fire, it will burn you, and that, if you cut your
finger very deeply with a knife, it generally bleeds, and she
had never forgotten that, if you drink a bottle marked "poison,"
it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later STOP However, this bottle was not marked poison, so Alice tasted it,
and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy,
and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off STOP "What a curious feeling! STOP said Alice, "I must be shutting up like
a telescope. STOP It was so indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up as it occurred to her that she was now the right
size for going through the little door into that lovely garden STOP First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see whether she
was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about
this, "for it might end, you know," said Alice to herself, "in my
going out altogether, like a candle, and what should I be like
then, I wonder? STOP and she tried to fancy what the flame of a
candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not
remember having ever seen one STOP However, nothing more happened so
she decided on going into the garden at once, but, alas for poor
Alice STOP when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the
little golden key, and when she went back to the table for the
key, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it
plainly enough through the glass, and she tried her best to climb
up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and
when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried STOP [Illustration]

"Come STOP there's no use in crying! STOP said Alice to herself rather
sharply, "I advise you to leave off this minute! STOP (she generally
gave herself very good advice, and sometimes scolded herself so
severely as to bring tears into her eyes, and once she remembered
boxing her own ears for having been unkind to herself in a game
of croquet she was playing with herself, for this curious child
was very fond of pretending to be two people,) "but it's no use
now," thought poor Alice, "to pretend to be two people STOP Why,
there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person! STOP Soon her eyes fell on a little ebony box lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which was
lying a card with the words EAT ME beautifully printed on it in
large letters STOP "I'll eat," said Alice, "and if it makes me
larger, I can reach the key, and if it makes me smaller, I can
creep under the door, so either way I'll get into the garden, and
I don't care which happens! STOP She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself "which way STOP which way? STOP and laid her hand on the top of her head to feel
which way it was growing, and was quite surprised to find that
she remained the same size: to be sure this is what generally
happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got into the way of
expecting nothing but out-of-the way things to happen, and it
seemed quite dull and stupid for things to go on in the common
way STOP So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake STOP "Curiouser and curiouser! STOP cried Alice, (she was so surprised
that she quite forgot how to speak good English,) "now I'm
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was STOP Goodbye,
feet! STOP (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed almost
out of sight, they were getting so far off,) "oh, my poor little
feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you
now, dears STOP I'm sure I can't STOP I shall be a great deal too far off
to bother myself about you: you must manage the best way you
can--but I must be kind to them," thought Alice, "or perhaps they
won't walk the way I want to go STOP Let me see: I'll give them a new
pair of boots every Christmas. STOP [Illustration]

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it
"they must go by the carrier," she thought, "and how funny it'll
seem, sending presents to one's own feet STOP And how odd the
directions will look STOP ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ STOP THE CARPET,
                              with ALICE'S LOVE

oh dear STOP what nonsense I am talking! STOP Just at this moment, her head struck against the roof of the
hall: in fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and
she at once took up the little golden key, and hurried off to the
garden door STOP Poor Alice STOP it was as much as she could do, lying down on one
side, to look through into the garden with one eye, but to get
through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and cried
again STOP "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said Alice, "a great girl
like you," (she might well say this,) "to cry in this way STOP Stop
this instant, I tell you! STOP But she cried on all the same,
shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool, about
four inches deep, all round her, and reaching half way across the
hall STOP After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the
distance, and dried her eyes to see what was coming STOP It was the
white rabbit coming back again, splendidly dressed, with a pair
of white kid gloves in one hand, and a nosegay in the other STOP Alice was ready to ask help of any one, she felt so desperate,
and as the rabbit passed her, she said, in a low, timid voice,
"If you please, Sir--" the rabbit started violently, looked up
once into the roof of the hall, from which the voice seemed to
come, and then dropped the nosegay and the white kid gloves, and
skurried away into the darkness, as hard as it could go STOP [Illustration]

Alice took up the nosegay and gloves, and found the nosegay so
delicious that she kept smelling at it all the time she went on
talking to herself--"dear, dear STOP how queer everything is today STOP and yesterday everything happened just as usual: I wonder if I
was changed in the night STOP Let me think: was I the same when I got
up this morning STOP I think I remember feeling rather different STOP But if I'm not the same, who in the world am I STOP Ah, that's the
great puzzle! STOP And she began thinking over all the children she
knew of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been
changed for any of them STOP "I'm sure I'm not Gertrude," she said, "for her hair goes in such
long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all--and I'm
sure I ca'n't be Florence, for I know all sorts of things, and
she, oh STOP she knows such a very little STOP Besides, she's she, and
I'm I, and--oh dear STOP how puzzling it all is STOP I'll try if I know
all the things I used to know STOP Let me see: four times five is
twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is
fourteen--oh dear STOP I shall never get to twenty at this rate STOP But
the Multiplication Table don't signify--let's try Geography STOP London is the capital of France, and Rome is the capital of
Yorkshire, and Paris--oh dear STOP dear STOP that's all wrong, I'm
certain STOP I must have been changed for Florence STOP I'll try and say
"How doth the little,"" and she crossed her hands on her lap,
and began, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the
words did not sound the same as they used to do:

    "How doth the little crocodile
      Improve its shining tail,
    And pour the waters of the Nile
      On every golden scale STOP "How cheerfully it seems to grin STOP How neatly spreads its claws STOP And welcomes little fishes in
      With gently-smiling jaws! STOP "I'm sure those are not the right words," said poor Alice, and
her eyes filled with tears as she thought "I must be Florence
after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh STOP ever so
many lessons to learn STOP No STOP I've made up my mind about it: if I'm
Florence, I'll stay down here STOP It'll be no use their putting
their heads down and saying 'come up, dear! STOP I shall only look
up and say 'who am I then STOP answer me that first, and then, if I
like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here
till I'm somebody else--but, oh dear! STOP cried Alice with a sudden
burst of tears, "I do wish they would put their heads down STOP I am
so tired of being all alone here! STOP As she said this, she looked down at her hands, and was surprised
to find she had put on one of the rabbit's little gloves while
she was talking STOP "How can I have done that? STOP thought she, "I must
be growing small again. STOP She got up and went to the table to
measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could
guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on
shrinking rapidly: soon she found out that the reason of it was
the nosegay she held in her hand: she dropped it hastily, just in
time to save herself from shrinking away altogether, and found
that she was now only three inches high STOP "Now for the garden! STOP cried Alice, as she hurried back to the
little door, but the little door was locked again, and the little
gold key was lying on the glass table as before, and "things are
worse than ever! STOP thought the poor little girl, "for I never was
as small as this before, never STOP And I declare it's too bad, it
is! STOP [Illustration]

At this moment her foot slipped, and splash STOP she was up to her
chin in salt water STOP Her first idea was that she had fallen into
the sea: then she remembered that she was under ground, and she
soon made out that it was the pool of tears she had wept when she
was nine feet high STOP "I wish I hadn't cried so much! STOP said Alice,
as she swam about, trying to find her way out, "I shall be
punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears STOP Well STOP that'll be a queer thing, to be sure STOP However, every thing
is queer today. STOP Very soon she saw something splashing about in
the pool near her: at first she thought it must be a walrus or a
hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was herself,
and soon made out that it was only a mouse, that had slipped in
like herself STOP "Would it be any use, now," thought Alice, "to speak to this
mouse STOP The rabbit is something quite out-of-the-way, no doubt,
and so have I been, ever since I came down here, but that is no
reason why the mouse should not be able to talk STOP I think I may as
well try. STOP So she began: "oh Mouse, do you know how to get out of this pool STOP I am very tired of swimming about here, oh Mouse! STOP The mouse
looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink
with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing STOP [Illustration]

"Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice; "I
daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the
Conqueror! STOP (for, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had
no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened,) so she
began again: "ou est ma chatte? STOP which was the first sentence out
of her French lesson-book STOP The mouse gave a sudden jump in the
pool, and seemed to quiver with fright: "oh, I beg your pardon! STOP cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's
feelings, "I quite forgot you didn't like cats! STOP "Not like cats! STOP cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice,
"would you like cats if you were me? STOP "Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone, "don't be
angry about it STOP And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I
think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her STOP She
is such a dear quiet thing," said Alice, half to herself, as she
swam lazily about in the pool, "she sits purring so nicely by the
fire, licking her paws and washing her face: and she is such a
nice soft thing to nurse, and she's such a capital one for
catching mice--oh STOP I beg your pardon! STOP cried poor Alice again,
for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt
certain that it was really offended, "have I offended you? STOP "Offended indeed! STOP cried the mouse, who seemed to be positively
trembling with rage, "our family always hated cats STOP Nasty, low,
vulgar things STOP Don't talk to me about them any more! STOP "I won't indeed! STOP said Alice, in a great hurry to change the
conversation, "are you--are you--fond of--dogs? STOP The mouse did
not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: "there is such a nice
little dog near our house I should like to show you STOP A little
bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh STOP such long curly brown
hair STOP And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit
up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I ca'n't
remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, and he says it
kills all the rats and--oh dear! STOP said Alice sadly, "I'm afraid
I've offended it again! STOP for the mouse was swimming away from her
as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool
as it went STOP So she called softly after it: "mouse dear STOP Do come back again,
and we won't talk about cats and dogs any more, if you don't like
them! STOP When the mouse heard this, it turned and swam slowly back
to her: its face was quite pale, (with passion, Alice thought,)
and it said in a trembling low voice "let's get to the shore, and
then I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is I
hate cats and dogs. STOP It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of
birds and animals that had fallen into it STOP There was a Duck and a
Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures STOP Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore STOP [Illustration]






[Illustration]


They were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the
bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their
fur clinging close to them--all dripping wet, cross, and
uncomfortable STOP The first question of course was, how to get dry:
they had a consultation about this, and Alice hardly felt at all
surprised at finding herself talking familiarly with the birds,
as if she had known them all her life STOP Indeed, she had quite a
long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would
only say "I am older than you, and must know best," and this
Alice would not admit without knowing how old the Lory was, and
as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was nothing
more to be said STOP At last the mouse, who seemed to have some authority among them,
called out "sit down, all of you, and attend to me STOP I'll soon
make you dry enough! STOP They all sat down at once, shivering, in a
large ring, Alice in the middle, with her eyes anxiously fixed on
the mouse, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she
did not get dry very soon STOP "Ahem! STOP said the mouse, with a self-important air, "are you all
ready STOP This is the driest thing I know STOP Silence all round, if you
please STOP "William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was
soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had
been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest STOP Edwin
and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"

"Ugh! STOP said the Lory with a shiver STOP "I beg your pardon? STOP said the mouse, frowning, but very politely,
"did you speak? STOP "Not I! STOP said the Lory hastily STOP "I thought you did," said the mouse, "I proceed STOP Edwin and
Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him;
and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer
him the crown STOP William's conduct was at first moderate--how are
you getting on now, dear? STOP said the mouse, turning to Alice as it
spoke STOP "As wet as ever," said poor Alice, "it doesn't seem to dry me at
all. STOP "In that case," said the Dodo solemnly, rising to his feet, "I
move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more
energetic remedies--"

"Speak English! STOP said the Duck, "I don't know the meaning of half
those long words, and what's more, I don't believe you do
either! STOP And the Duck quacked a comfortable laugh to itself STOP Some
of the other birds tittered audibly STOP "I only meant to say," said the Dodo in a rather offended tone,
"that I know of a house near here, where we could get the young
lady and the rest of the party dried, and then we could listen
comfortably to the story which I think you were good enough to
promise to tell us," bowing gravely to the mouse STOP The mouse made no objection to this, and the whole party moved
along the river bank, (for the pool had by this time began to
flow out of the hall, and the edge of it was fringed with rushes
and forget-me-nots,) in a slow procession, the Dodo leading the
way STOP After a time the Dodo became impatient, and, leaving the
Duck to bring up the rest of the party, moved on at a quicker
pace with Alice, the Lory, and the Eaglet, and soon brought them
to a little cottage, and there they sat snugly by the fire,
wrapped up in blankets, until the rest of the party had arrived,
and they were all dry again STOP Then they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank, and
begged the mouse to begin his story STOP "Mine is a long and a sad tale! STOP said the mouse, turning to
Alice, and sighing STOP "It is a long tail, certainly," said Alice, looking down with
wonder at the mouse's tail, which was coiled nearly all round the
party, "but why do you call it sad? STOP and she went on puzzling
about this as the mouse went on speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:

We lived beneath the mat
       Warm and snug and fat
              But one woe, & that
                       Was the cat STOP To our joys

   T h i n k STOP o f t h a t STOP "You are not attending! STOP said the mouse to Alice severely, "what
are you thinking of? STOP "I beg your pardon," said Alice very humbly, "you had got to the
fifth bend, I think? STOP "I had not! STOP cried the mouse, sharply and very angrily STOP "A knot! STOP said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and
looking anxiously about her, "oh, do let me help to undo it! STOP "I shall do nothing of the sort! STOP said the mouse, getting up and
walking away from the party, "you insult me by talking such
nonsense! STOP "I didn't mean it! STOP pleaded poor Alice, "but you're so easily
offended, you know. STOP The mouse only growled in reply STOP "Please come back and finish your story! STOP Alice called after it,
and the others all joined in chorus "yes, please do! STOP but the
mouse only shook its ears, and walked quickly away, and was soon
out of sight STOP "What a pity it wouldn't stay! STOP sighed the Lory, and an old Crab
took the opportunity of saying to its daughter "Ah, my dear STOP let
this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper! STOP "Hold your
tongue, Ma! STOP said the young Crab, a little snappishly, "you're
enough to try the patience of an oyster! STOP "I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do! STOP said Alice aloud,
addressing no one in particular, "she'd soon fetch it back! STOP "And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question? STOP said
the Lory STOP [Illustration]

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her
pet, "Dinah's our cat STOP And she's such a capital one for catching
mice, you can't think STOP And oh STOP I wish you could see her after the
birds STOP Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it! STOP This answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party: some
of the birds hurried off at once; one old magpie began wrapping
itself up very carefully, remarking "I really must be getting
home: the night air does not suit my throat," and a canary called
out in a trembling voice to its children "come away from her, my
dears, she's no fit company for you! STOP On various pretexts, they
all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone STOP [Illustration]

She sat for some while sorrowful and silent, but she was not long
before she recovered her spirits, and began talking to herself
again as usual: "I do wish some of them had stayed a little
longer STOP and I was getting to be such friends with them--really
the Lory and I were almost like sisters STOP and so was that dear
little Eaglet STOP And then the Duck and the Dodo STOP How nicely the
Duck sang to us as we came along through the water: and if the
Dodo hadn't known the way to that nice little cottage, I don't
know when we should have got dry again--" and there is no knowing
how long she might have prattled on in this way, if she had not
suddenly caught the sound of pattering feet STOP It was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about it as it went, as if it had lost something, and she
heard it muttering to itself "the Marchioness STOP the Marchioness STOP oh
my dear paws STOP oh my fur and whiskers STOP She'll have me executed, as
sure as ferrets are ferrets STOP Where can I have dropped them, I
wonder? STOP Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the
nosegay and the pair of white kid gloves, and she began hunting for
them, but they were now nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to
have changed since her swim in the pool, and her walk along the
river-bank with its fringe of rushes and forget-me-nots, and the
glass table and the little door had vanished STOP Soon the rabbit noticed Alice, as she stood looking curiously
about her, and at once said in a quick angry tone, "why, Mary
Ann STOP what are you doing out here STOP Go home this moment, and look
on my dressing-table for my gloves and nosegay, and fetch them
here, as quick as you can run, do you hear? STOP and Alice was so
much frightened that she ran off at once, without saying a word,
in the direction which the rabbit had pointed out STOP She soon found herself in front of a neat little house, on the
door of which was a bright brass plate with the name W. RABBIT,
ESQ STOP She went in, and hurried upstairs, for fear she should meet
the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had
found the gloves: she knew that one pair had been lost in the
hall, "but of course," thought Alice, "it has plenty more of them
in its house STOP How queer it seems to be going messages for a
rabbit STOP I suppose Dinah'll be sending me messages next! STOP And she
began fancying the sort of things that would happen: "Miss Alice STOP come here directly and get ready for your walk! STOP "Coming in a
minute, nurse STOP but I've got to watch this mousehole till Dinah
comes back, and see that the mouse doesn't get out--" "only I
don't think," Alice went on, "that they'd let Dinah stop in the
house, if it began ordering people about like that! STOP [Illustration]

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room, with a
table in the window on which was a looking-glass and, (as Alice had
hoped,) two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up a
pair of gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye
fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass: there
was no label on it this time with the words "drink me," but
nonetheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips: "I know
something interesting is sure to happen," she said to herself,
"whenever I eat or drink anything, so I'll see what this bottle
does STOP I do hope it'll make me grow larger, for I'm quite tired of
being such a tiny little thing! STOP [Illustration]

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she expected: before she
had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against
the ceiling, and she stooped to save her neck from being broken,
and hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself "that's quite
enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any more--I wish I hadn't drunk so
much! STOP [Illustration]

Alas STOP it was too late: she went on growing and growing, and very
soon had to kneel down: in another minute there was not room even
for this, and she tried the effect of lying down, with one elbow
against the door, and the other arm curled round her head STOP Still
she went on growing, and as a last resource she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself
"now I can do no more--what will become of me? STOP Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full
effect, and she grew no larger; still it was very uncomfortable,
and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of ever getting out
of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy STOP "It was much
pleasanter at home," thought poor Alice, "when one wasn't always
growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits--I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole, and
yet, and yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life STOP I
do wonder what can have happened to me STOP When I used to read
fairy-tales, I fancied that sort of thing never happened, and now
here I am in the middle of one STOP There out to be a book written
about me, that there ought STOP and when I grow up I'll write
one--but I'm grown up now" said she in a sorrowful tone, "at
least there's no room to grow up any more here. STOP [Illustration]

"But then," thought Alice, "shall I never get any older than I
am now STOP That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old
woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn STOP Oh, I shouldn't
like that! STOP "Oh, you foolish Alice! STOP she said again, "how can you learn
lessons in here STOP Why, there's hardly room for you, and no room at
all for any lesson-books! STOP And so she went on, taking first one side, and then the other,
and making quite a conversation of it altogether, but after a few
minutes she heard a voice outside, which made her stop to listen STOP "Mary Ann STOP Mary Ann! STOP said the voice, "fetch me my gloves this
moment! STOP Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs:
Alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her, and she
trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was
now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit, and had no
reason to be afraid of it STOP Presently the rabbit came to the door,
and tried to open it, but as it opened inwards, and Alice's elbow
was against it, the attempt proved a failure STOP Alice heard it say
to itself "then I'll go round and get in at the window. STOP "That you wo'n't! STOP thought Alice, and, after waiting till she
fancied she heard the rabbit, just under the window, she suddenly
spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air STOP She did not
get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall
and a crash of breaking glass, from which she concluded that it
was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or
something of the sort STOP [Illustration]

Next came an angry voice--the rabbit's--"Pat, Pat STOP where are
you? STOP And then a voice she had never heard before, "shure then
I'm here STOP digging for apples, anyway, yer honour! STOP "Digging for apples indeed! STOP said the rabbit angrily, "here, come
and help me out of this! STOP --Sound of more breaking glass STOP "Now, tell me, Pat, what is that coming out of the window? STOP "Shure it's an arm, yer honour! STOP (He pronounced it "arrum". STOP "An arm, you goose STOP Who ever saw an arm that size STOP Why, it fills
the whole window, don't you see? STOP "Shure, it does, yer honour, but it's an arm for all that. STOP "Well, it's no business there: go and take it away! STOP There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear
whispers now and then, such as "shure I don't like it, yer
honour, at all at all! STOP "do as I tell you, you coward! STOP and at
last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the
air STOP This time there were two little shrieks, and more breaking
glass--"what a number of cucumber-frames there must be! STOP thought
Alice, "I wonder what they'll do next STOP As for pulling me out of
the window, I only wish they could STOP I'm sure I don't want to stop
in here any longer! STOP She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last
came a rumbling of little cart-wheels, and the sound of a good
many voices all talking together: she made out the words "where's
the other ladder?--why, I hadn't to bring but one, Bill's got the
other--here, put 'em up at this corner--no, tie 'em together
first--they don't reach high enough yet--oh, they'll do well
enough, don't be particular--here, Bill STOP catch hold of this
rope--will the roof bear?--mind that loose slate--oh, it's coming
down STOP heads below!--" (a loud crash) "now, who did that?--it was
Bill, I fancy--who's to go down the chimney?--nay, I sha'n't STOP you
do it!--that I won't then--Bill's got to go down--here, Bill STOP the
master says you've to go down the chimney! STOP "Oh, so Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he? STOP said Alice
to herself, "why, they seem to put everything upon Bill STOP I
wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: the fireplace is a
pretty tight one, but I think I can kick a little! STOP She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and
waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess what
sort it was) scratching and scrambling in the chimney close above
her: then, saying to herself "this is Bill," she gave one sharp
kick, and waited again to see what would happen next STOP [Illustration]

The first thing was a general chorus of "there goes Bill! STOP then
the rabbit's voice alone "catch him, you by the hedge! STOP then
silence, and then another confusion of voices, "how was it, old
fellow STOP what happened to you STOP tell us all about it. STOP Last came a little feeble squeaking voice, ("that's Bill" thought
Alice,) which said "well, I hardly know--I'm all of a fluster
myself--something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and the
next minute up I goes like a rocket! STOP "And so you did, old
fellow! STOP said the other voices STOP "We must burn the house down! STOP said the voice of the rabbit, and
Alice called out as loud as she could "if you do, I'll set Dinah
at you! STOP This caused silence again, and while Alice was thinking
"but how can I get Dinah here? STOP she found to her great delight
that she was getting smaller: very soon she was able to get up
out of the uncomfortable position in which she had been lying,
and in two or three minutes more she was once more three inches
high STOP She ran out of the house as quick as she could, and found quite a
crowd of little animals waiting outside--guinea-pigs, white mice,
squirrels, and "Bill" a little green lizard, that was being
supported in the arms of one of the guinea-pigs, while another
was giving it something out of a bottle STOP They all made a rush at
her the moment she appeared, but Alice ran her hardest, and soon
found herself in a thick wood STOP [Illustration]






[Illustration]


"The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size, and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden STOP I think
that will be the best plan. STOP It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and
simply arranged: the only difficulty was, that she had not the
smallest idea how to set about it, and while she was peering
anxiously among the trees round her, a little sharp bark just
over her head made her look up in a great hurry STOP An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes,
and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to reach her: "poor
thing! STOP said Alice in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to
whistle to it, but she was terribly alarmed all the while at the
thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would probably
devour her in spite of all her coaxing STOP Hardly knowing what she
did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the
puppy: whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at
once, and with a yelp of delight rushed at the stick, and made
believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle to
keep herself from being run over, and, the moment she appeared at
the other side, the puppy made another dart at the stick, and
tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold: then Alice,
thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse,
and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round
the thistle again: then the puppy begin a series of short charges
at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a
long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it
sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of
its mouth, and its great eyes half shut STOP This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape STOP She set off at once, and ran till the puppy's bark sounded quite
faint in the distance, and till she was quite tired and out of
breath STOP "And yet what a dear little puppy it was! STOP said Alice, as she
leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself
with her hat STOP "I should have liked teaching it tricks, if--if I'd
only been the right size to do it STOP Oh STOP I'd nearly forgotten that
I've got to grow up again STOP Let me see; how _is_ it to be managed STOP I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other, but the
great question is what? STOP The great question certainly was, what STOP Alice looked all round
her at the flowers and the blades of grass but could not see
anything that looked like the right thing to eat under the
circumstances STOP There was a large mushroom near her, about the
same height as herself, and when she had looked under it, and on
both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her to look and
see what was on the top of it STOP She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of
the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
caterpillar, which was sitting with its arms folded, quietly
smoking a long hookah, and taking not the least notice of her or
of anything else STOP [Illustration]

For some time they looked at each other in silence: at last the
caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and languidly
addressed her STOP "Who are you? STOP said the caterpillar STOP This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation: Alice
replied rather shyly, "I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at
least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I
must have been changed several times since that. STOP "What do you mean by that? STOP said the caterpillar, "explain
yourself! STOP "I ca'n't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir," said Alice, "because
I'm not myself, you see. STOP "I don't see," said the caterpillar STOP "I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," Alice replied very
politely, "for I ca'n't understand it myself, and really to be so
many different sizes in one day is very confusing. STOP "It isn't," said the caterpillar STOP "Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet," said Alice, "but
when you have to turn into a chrysalis, you know, and then after
that into a butterfly, I should think it'll feel a little queer,
don't you think so? STOP "Not a bit," said the caterpillar STOP "All I know is," said Alice, "it would feel queer to me. STOP "You! STOP said the caterpillar contemptuously, "who are you? STOP Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
conversation: Alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar
making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said
very gravely "I think you ought to tell me who you are, first. STOP "Why? STOP said the caterpillar STOP Here was another puzzling question: and as Alice had no reason
ready, and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very bad temper, she
turned round and walked away STOP "Come back! STOP the caterpillar called after her, "I've something
important to say! STOP This sounded promising: Alice turned and came back again STOP "Keep your temper," said the caterpillar STOP "Is that all? STOP said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as
she could STOP "No," said the caterpillar STOP Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to
do, and perhaps after all the caterpillar might tell her
something worth hearing STOP For some minutes it puffed away at its
hookah without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took
the hookah out of its mouth again, and said "so you think you're
changed, do you? STOP "Yes, sir," said Alice, "I ca'n't remember the things I used to
know--I've tried to say "How doth the little busy bee" and it
came all different! STOP "Try and repeat "You are old, father William"," said the
caterpillar STOP Alice folded her hands, and began:

[Illustration]

1 STOP "You are old, father William," the young man said,
        "And your hair is exceedingly white:
    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
        Do you think, at your age, it is right? STOP 2 STOP "In my youth," father William replied to his son,
        "I feared it might injure the brain
    But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
        Why, I do it again and again. STOP [Illustration]

3 STOP "You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,
        And have grown most uncommonly fat:
    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
        Pray what is the reason of that? STOP 4 STOP "In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his gray locks,
        "I kept all my limbs very supple,
    By the use of this ointment, five shillings the box--
        Allow me to sell you a couple. STOP [Illustration]

5 STOP "You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak
        For anything tougher than suet:
    Yet you eat all the goose, with the bones and the beak--
        Pray, how did you manage to do it? STOP 6 STOP "In my youth," said the old man, "I took to the law,
        And argued each case with my wife,
    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
        Has lasted the rest of my life. STOP [Illustration]

7 STOP "You are old," said the youth; "one would hardly suppose
        That your eye was as steady as ever:
    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
        What made you so awfully clever? STOP 8 STOP "I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"
        Said his father, "don't give yourself airs STOP Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff STOP Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs! STOP "That is not said right," said the caterpillar STOP "Not quite right, I'm afraid," said Alice timidly, "some of the
words have got altered. STOP "It is wrong from beginning to end," said the caterpillar
decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes: the caterpillar
was the first to speak STOP "What size do you want to be? STOP it asked STOP "Oh, I'm not particular as to size," Alice hastily replied, "only
one doesn't like changing so often, you know. STOP "Are you content now? STOP said the caterpillar STOP "Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't
mind," said Alice, "three inches is such a wretched height to
be. STOP "It is a very good height indeed! STOP said the caterpillar loudly
and angrily, rearing itself straight up as it spoke (it was
exactly three inches high) STOP "But I'm not used to it! STOP pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone,
and she thought to herself "I wish the creatures wouldn't be so
easily offended! STOP "You'll get used to it in time," said the caterpillar, and it put
the hookah into its mouth, and began smoking again STOP This time Alice waited quietly until it chose to speak again: in
a few minutes the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth,
and got down off the mushroom, and crawled away into the grass,
merely remarking as it went; "the top will make you grow taller,
and the stalk will make you grow shorter. STOP "The top of what STOP the stalk of what? STOP thought Alice STOP "Of the mushroom," said the caterpillar, just as if she had asked
it aloud, and in another moment was out of sight STOP Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
and then picked it and carefully broke it in two, taking the
stalk in one hand, and the top in the other STOP [Illustration]

"Which does the stalk do? STOP she said, and nibbled a little bit of
it to try; the next moment she felt a violent blow on her chin:
it had struck her foot STOP She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but as
she did not shrink any further, and had not dropped the top of
the mushroom, she did not give up hope yet STOP There was hardly room
to open her mouth, with her chin pressing against her foot, but
she did it at last, and managed to bite off a little bit of the
top of the mushroom STOP "Come STOP my head's free at last! STOP said Alice in a tone of delight,
which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that
her shoulders were nowhere to be seen: she looked down upon an
immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of
a sea of green leaves that lay far below her STOP [Illustration]

"What can all that green stuff be? STOP said Alice, "and where have
my shoulders got to STOP And oh STOP my poor hands STOP how is it I ca'n't
see you? STOP She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result
seemed to follow, except a little rustling among the leaves STOP Then
she tried to bring her head down to her hands, and was delighted
to find that her neck would bend about easily in every direction,
like a serpent STOP She had just succeeded in bending it down in a
beautiful zig-zag, and was going to dive in among the leaves,
which she found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had
been wandering in, when a sharp hiss made her draw back: a large
pigeon had flown into her face, and was violently beating her
with its wings STOP [Illustration]

"Serpent! STOP screamed the pigeon STOP "I'm not a serpent! STOP said Alice indignantly, "let me alone! STOP "I've tried every way! STOP the pigeon said desperately, with a kind
of sob: "nothing seems to suit 'em! STOP "I haven't the least idea what you mean," said Alice STOP "I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've
tried hedges," the pigeon went on without attending to her, "but
them serpents STOP There's no pleasing 'em! STOP Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use
in saying anything till the pigeon had finished STOP "As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs! STOP said the
pigeon, "without being on the look out for serpents, day and
night STOP Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks! STOP "I'm very sorry you've been annoyed," said Alice, beginning to
see its meaning STOP "And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," said the
pigeon raising its voice to a shriek, "and was just thinking I
was free of 'em at last, they must needs come down from the sky STOP Ugh STOP Serpent! STOP "But I'm not a serpent," said Alice, "I'm a--I'm a--"

"Well STOP What are you? STOP said the pigeon, "I see you're trying to
invent something. STOP "I--I'm a little girl," said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she
remembered the number of changes she had gone through STOP "A likely story indeed! STOP said the pigeon, "I've seen a good many
of them in my time, but never one with such a neck as yours STOP No,
you're a serpent, I know that well enough STOP I suppose you'll tell
me next that you never tasted an egg! STOP "I have tasted eggs, certainly," said Alice, who was a very
truthful child, "but indeed I do'n't want any of yours STOP I do'n't
like them raw. STOP "Well, be off, then! STOP said the pigeon, and settled down into its
nest again STOP Alice crouched down among the trees, as well as she
could, as her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
several times she had to stop and untwist it STOP Soon she remembered
the pieces of mushroom which she still held in her hands, and set
to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual size STOP It was so long since she had been of the right size that it felt
quite strange at first, but she got quite used to it in a minute
or two, and began talking to herself as usual: "well STOP there's
half my plan done now STOP How puzzling all these changes are STOP I'm
never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another STOP However, I've got to my right size again: the next thing is, to
get into that beautiful garden--how is that to be done, I
wonder? STOP Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a
doorway leading right into it STOP "That's very curious! STOP she
thought, "but everything's curious today: I may as well go in. STOP And in she went STOP Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the
little glass table: "now, I'll manage better this time" she said
to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and
unlocking the door that led into the garden STOP Then she set to work
eating the pieces of mushroom till she was about fifteen inches
high: then she walked down the little passage: and then--she
found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright
flowerbeds and the cool fountains STOP [Illustration]






[Illustration]


A large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the
roses on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it,
busily painting them red STOP This Alice thought a very curious
thing, and she went near to watch them, and just as she came up
she heard one of them say "look out, Five STOP Don't go splashing
paint over me like that! STOP "I couldn't help it," said Five in a sulky tone, "Seven jogged my
elbow. STOP On which Seven lifted up his head and said "that's right, Five STOP Always lay the blame on others! STOP "You'd better not talk! STOP said Five, "I heard the Queen say only
yesterday she thought of having you beheaded! STOP "What for? STOP said the one who had spoken first STOP "That's not your business, Two! STOP said Seven STOP "Yes, it is his business! STOP said Five, "and I'll tell him: it was
for bringing in tulip-roots to the cook instead of potatoes. STOP Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun "well STOP Of all the
unjust things--" when his eye fell upon Alice, and he stopped
suddenly; the others looked round, and all of them took off their
hats and bowed low STOP "Would you tell me, please," said Alice timidly, "why you are
painting those roses? STOP Five and Seven looked at Two, but said nothing: Two began, in a
low voice, "why, Miss, the fact is, this ought to have been a red
rose tree, and we put a white one in by mistake, and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off STOP So, you
see, we're doing our best, before she comes, to--" At this moment
Five, who had been looking anxiously across the garden called out
"the Queen STOP the Queen! STOP and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces STOP There was a sound of many
footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen STOP First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped
like the three gardeners, flat and oblong, with their hands and
feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all
ornamented with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers
did STOP After these came the Royal children: there were ten of them,
and the little dears came jumping merrily along, hand in hand, in
couples: they were all ornamented with hearts STOP Next came the
guests, mostly kings and queens, among whom Alice recognised the
white rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling
at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her STOP Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a
cushion, and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING
AND QUEEN OF HEARTS STOP [Illustration]

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and
looked at her, and the Queen said severely "who is this? STOP She
said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in
reply STOP "Idiot! STOP said the Queen, turning up her nose, and asked Alice
"what's your name? STOP "My name is Alice, so please your Majesty," said Alice boldly,
for she thought to herself "why, they're only a pack of cards STOP I
needn't be afraid of them! STOP "Who are these? STOP said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners
lying round the rose tree, for, as they were lying on their
faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or
soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children STOP "How should I know? STOP said Alice, surprised at her own courage,
"it's no business of mine. STOP The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for
a minute, began in a voice of thunder "off with her--"

"Nonsense! STOP said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen
was silent STOP The King laid his hand upon her arm, and said timidly "remember,
my dear STOP She is only a child! STOP The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave
"turn them over! STOP The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot STOP "Get up! STOP said the Queen, in a shrill loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the
Queen, the Royal children, and everybody else STOP "Leave off that! STOP screamed the Queen, "you make me giddy. STOP And
then, turning to the rose tree, she went on "what have you been
doing here? STOP "May it please your Majesty," said Two very humbly, going down on
one knee as he spoke, "we were trying--"

"I see! STOP said the Queen, who had meantime been examining the
roses, "off with their heads! STOP and the procession moved on, three
of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the three unfortunate
gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection STOP "You sha'n't be beheaded! STOP said Alice, and she put them into her
pocket: the three soldiers marched once round her, looking for
them, and then quietly marched off after the others STOP "Are their heads off? STOP shouted the Queen STOP "Their heads are gone," the soldiers shouted in reply, "if it
please your Majesty! STOP "That's right! STOP shouted the Queen, "can you play croquet? STOP The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question
was evidently meant for her STOP "Yes! STOP shouted Alice at the top of her voice STOP "Come on then! STOP roared the Queen, and Alice joined the
procession, wondering very much what would happen next STOP "It's--it's a very fine day! STOP said a timid little voice: she was
walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her
face STOP "Very," said Alice, "where's the Marchioness? STOP "Hush, hush! STOP said the rabbit in a low voice, "she'll hear you STOP The Queen's the Marchioness: didn't you know that? STOP "No, I didn't," said Alice, "what of? STOP "Queen of Hearts," said the rabbit in a whisper, putting its
mouth close to her ear, "and Marchioness of Mock Turtles. STOP "What are they? STOP said Alice, but there was no time for the
answer, for they had reached the croquet-ground, and the game
began instantly STOP Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
all her life: it was all in ridges and furrows: the croquet-balls
were live hedgehogs, the mallets live ostriches, and the soldiers
had to double themselves up, and stand on their feet and hands,
to make the arches STOP [Illustration]

[Illustration]

The chief difficulty which Alice found at first was to manage her
ostrich: she got its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under
her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
had got its neck straightened out nicely, and was going to give a
blow with its head, it would twist itself round, and look up into
her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and
was going to begin again, it was very confusing to find that the
hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling
away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or a furrow
in her way, wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and as
the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to
other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion
that it was a very difficult game indeed STOP The players all played at once without waiting for turns, and
quarrelled all the while at the tops of their voices, and in a
very few minutes the Queen was in a furious passion, and went
stamping about and shouting "off with his head! STOP of "off with her
head! STOP about once in a minute STOP All those whom she sentenced were
taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave
off being arches to do this, so that, by the end of half an hour
or so, there were no arches left, and all the players, except the
King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody, and under sentence
of execution STOP Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice
"have you seen the Mock Turtle? STOP "No," said Alice, "I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is. STOP "Come on then," said the Queen, "and it shall tell you its
history. STOP As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low
voice, to the company generally, "you are all pardoned. STOP "Come, that's a good thing! STOP thought Alice, who had felt quite
grieved at the number of executions which the Queen had ordered STOP [Illustration]

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, which lay fast asleep in the
sun: (if you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture):
"Up, lazy thing! STOP said the Queen, "and take this young lady to
see the Mock Turtle, and to hear its history STOP I must go back and
see after some executions I ordered," and she walked off, leaving
Alice with the Gryphon STOP Alice did not quite like the look of the
creature, but on the whole she thought it quite as safe to stay
as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited STOP The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen
till she was out of sight: then it chuckled STOP "What fun! STOP said the
Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice STOP "What is the fun? STOP said Alice STOP "Why, she," said the Gryphon; "it's all her fancy, that: they
never executes nobody, you know: come on! STOP "Everybody says 'come on! STOP here," thought Alice as she walked
slowly after the Gryphon; "I never was ordered about so before in
all my life--never! STOP They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the
distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,
as they came nearer, Alice could here it sighing as if its heart
would break STOP She pitied it deeply: "what is its sorrow? STOP she
asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the
same words as before, "it's all its fancy, that: it hasn't got no
sorrow, you know: come on! STOP [Illustration]

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large
eyes full of tears, but said nothing STOP "This here young lady" said the Gryphon, "wants for to know your
history, she do. STOP "I'll tell it," said the Mock Turtle, in a deep hollow tone, "sit
down, and don't speak till I've finished. STOP So they sat down, and no one spoke for some minutes: Alice
thought to herself "I don't see how it can ever finish, if it
doesn't begin," but she waited patiently STOP "Once," said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, "I was a
real Turtle. STOP These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by
an occasional exclamation of "hjckrrh! STOP from the Gryphon, and the
constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle STOP Alice was very nearly
getting up and saying, "thank you, sir, for your interesting
story," but she could not help thinking there must be more to
come, so she sat still and said nothing STOP "When we were little," the Mock Turtle went on, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, "we went to school in
the sea STOP The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him
Tortoise--"

"Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one? STOP asked Alice STOP "We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the Mock
Turtle angrily, "really you are very dull! STOP "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question," added the Gryphon, and then they both sat silent and
looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth: at
last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, "get on, old fellow STOP Don't be all day! STOP and the Mock Turtle went on in these words:

"You may not have lived much under the sea--" ("I haven't," said
Alice,) "and perhaps you were never even introduced to a
lobster--" (Alice began to say "I once tasted--" but hastily
checked herself, and said "no, never," instead,) "so you can have
no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is! STOP "No, indeed," said Alice, "what sort of a thing is it? STOP "Why," said the Gryphon, "you form into a line along the sea
shore--"

"Two lines! STOP cried the Mock Turtle, "seals, turtles, salmon, and
so on--advance twice--"

"Each with a lobster as partner! STOP cried the Gryphon STOP [Illustration]

"Of course," the Mock Turtle said, "advance twice, set to
partners--"

"Change lobsters, and retire in same order--" interrupted the
Gryphon STOP "Then, you know," continued the Mock Turtle, "you throw the--"

"The lobsters! STOP shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air STOP "As far out to sea as you can--"

"Swim after them! STOP screamed the Gryphon STOP "Turn a somersault in the sea! STOP cried the Mock Turtle, capering
wildly about STOP "Change lobsters again! STOP yelled the Gryphon at the top of its
voice, "and then--"

"That's all," said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping its voice,
and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things
all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked
at Alice STOP "It must be a very pretty dance," said Alice timidly STOP "Would you like to see a little of it? STOP said the Mock Turtle STOP "Very much indeed," said Alice STOP "Come, let's try the first figure! STOP said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon, "we can do it without lobsters, you know STOP Which shall
sing? STOP "Oh STOP you sing! STOP said the Gryphon, "I've forgotten the words. STOP [Illustration]

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now
and then treading on her toes when they came too close, and
waving their fore-paws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle
sang, slowly and sadly, these words:

    "Beneath the waters of the sea
    Are lobsters thick as thick can be--
    They love to dance with you and me,
      My own, my gentle Salmon! STOP The Gryphon joined in singing the chorus, which was:

    "Salmon come up STOP Salmon go down STOP Salmon come twist your tail around STOP Of all the fishes of the sea
      There's none so good as Salmon! STOP "Thank you," said Alice, feeling very glad that the figure was
over STOP "Shall we try the second figure? STOP said the Gryphon, "or would you
prefer a song? STOP "Oh, a song, please! STOP Alice replied, so eagerly, that the Gryphon
said, in a rather offended tone, "hm STOP no accounting for tastes STOP Sing her 'Mock Turtle Soup', will you, old fellow! STOP The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes
choked with sobs, to sing this:

    "Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
    Waiting in a hot tureen STOP Who for such dainties would not stoop STOP Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup STOP Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup STOP Beau--ootiful Soo--oop STOP Beau--ootiful Soo--oop STOP Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
        Beautiful beautiful Soup STOP "Chorus again! STOP cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just
begun to repeat it, when a cry of "the trial's beginning! STOP was
heard in the distance STOP "Come on! STOP cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, he
hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song STOP "What trial is it? STOP panted Alice as she ran, but the Gryphon only
answered "come on! STOP and ran the faster, and more and more faintly
came, borne on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy
words:

    "Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
    Beautiful beautiful Soup! STOP The King and Queen were seated on their throne when they arrived,
with a great crowd assembled around them: the Knave was in
custody: and before the King stood the white rabbit, with a
trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other STOP "Herald STOP read the accusation! STOP said the King STOP On this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and
then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:

[Illustration]

    "The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts
      All on a summer day:
    The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts,
      And took them quite away! STOP [Illustration]

"Now for the evidence," said the King, "and then the sentence. STOP "No! STOP said the Queen, "first the sentence, and then the
evidence! STOP "Nonsense! STOP cried Alice, so loudly that everybody jumped, "the
idea of having the sentence first! STOP "Hold your tongue! STOP said the Queen STOP "I won't! STOP said Alice, "you're nothing but a pack of cards STOP Who
cares for you? STOP At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down
upon her: she gave a little scream of fright, and tried to beat
them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in
the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some leaves
that had fluttered down from the trees on to her face STOP "Wake up STOP Alice dear! STOP said her sister, "what a nice long sleep
you've had! STOP "Oh, I've had such a curious dream! STOP said Alice, and she told her
sister all her Adventures Under Ground, as you have read them,
and when she had finished, her sister kissed her and said "it was
a curious dream, dear, certainly STOP But now run in to your tea:
it's getting late. STOP So Alice ran off, thinking while she ran (as well she might) what
a wonderful dream it had been STOP But her sister sat there some while longer, watching the setting
sun, and thinking of little Alice and her Adventures, till she
too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:

She saw an ancient city, and a quiet river winding near it along
the plain, and up the stream went slowly gliding a boat with a
merry party of children on board--she could hear their voices and
laughter like music over the water--and among them was another
little Alice, who sat listening with bright eager eyes to a tale
that was being told, and she listened for the words of the tale,
and lo STOP it was the dream of her own little sister STOP So the boat
wound slowly along, beneath the bright summer-day, with its merry
crew and its music of voices and laughter, till it passed round
one of the many turnings of the stream, and she saw it no more STOP Then she thought, (in a dream within the dream, as it were,) how
this same little Alice would, in the after-time, be herself a
grown woman: and how she would keep, through her riper years, the
simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would
gather around her other little children, and make their eyes
bright and eager with many a wonderful tale, perhaps even with
these very adventures of the little Alice of long-ago: and how
she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure
in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the
happy summer days STOP [Illustration]

happy summer days STOP THE END STOP _POSTSCRIPT._


_The profits, if any, of this book will be given to Children's
Hospitals and Convalescent Homes for Sick Children; and the
accounts, down to June 30 in each year, will be published in the
St. James's Gazette, on the second Tuesday of the following
December._

_P.P.S.--The thought, so prettily expressed by the little boy, is
also to be found in Longfellow's "Hiawatha," where he appeals to
those who believe_

    "_That the feeble hands and helpless,_
    _Groping blindly in the darkness_,
    _Touch_ GOD'S _right hand in that darkness_,
    _And are lifted up and strengthened_. STOP "Who will Riddle me the How and the Why? STOP _So questions one of England's sweetest singers STOP The "How? STOP has
already been told, after a fashion, in the verses prefixed to
"Alice in Wonderland"; and some other memories of that happy
summer day are set down, for those who care to see them, in this
little book--the germ that was to grow into the published volume STOP But the "Why? STOP cannot, and need not, be put into words STOP Those for
whom a child's mind is a sealed book, and who see no divinity in
a child's smile, would read such words in vain: while for any one
that has ever loved one true child, no words are needed STOP For he
will have known the awe that falls on one in the presence of a
spirit fresh from_ GOD'S _hands, on whom no shadow of sin, and
but the outermost fringe of the shadow of sorrow, has yet fallen:
he will have felt the bitter contrast between the haunting
selfishness that spoils his best deeds and the life that is but
an overflowing love--for I think a child's_ first _attitude to
the world is a simple love for all living things: and he will
have learned that the best work a man can do is when he works for
love's sake only, with no thought of name, or gain, or earthly
reward STOP No deed of ours, I suppose, on this side the grave, is
really unselfish: yet if one can put forth all one's powers in a
task where nothing of reward is hoped for but a little child's
whispered thanks, and the airy touch of a little child's pure
lips, one seems to come somewhere near to this._

_There was no idea of publication in my mind when I wrote this
little book_: that _was wholly an afterthought, pressed on me by
the "perhaps too partial friends" who always have to bear the
blame when a writer rushes into print: and I can truly say that
no praise of theirs has ever given me one hundredth part of the
pleasure it has been to think of the sick children in hospitals
(where it has been a delight to me to send copies) forgetting,
for a few bright hours, their pain and weariness--perhaps
thinking lovingly of the unknown writer of the tale--perhaps even
putting up a childish prayer (and oh, how much it needs! STOP for one
who can but dimly hope to stand, some day, not quite out of sight
of those pure young faces, before the great white throne STOP "I am
very sure," writes a lady-visitor at a Home for Sick Children,
"that there will be many loving earnest prayers for you on Easter
morning from the children._"

_I would like to quote further from her letters, as embodying a
suggestion that may perhaps thus come to the notice of some one
able and willing to carry it out._

"_I want you to send me one of your Easter Greetings for a very
dear child who is dying at our Home STOP She is just fading away, and
'Alice' has brightened some of the weary hours in her illness,
and I know that letter would be such a delight to her--especially
if you would put 'Minnie' at the top, and she could know you had
sent it for her._ She _knows_ you, _and would so value it.... She
suffers so much that I long for what I know would so please her. STOP ... "Thank you very much for sending me the letter, and for
writing Minnie's name... STOP I am quite sure that all these children
will say a loving prayer for the 'Alice-man' on Easter Day: and I
am sure the letter will help the little ones to the real Easter
joy STOP How I do wish that you, who have won the hearts and
confidence of so many children, would do for them what is so very
near my heart, and yet what no one will do, viz STOP write a book for
children about_ GOD _and themselves, which is_ not _goody, and
which begins at the right end, about religion, to make them see
what it really is STOP I get quite miserable very often over the
children I come across: hardly any of them have an idea of_
really _knowing that_ GOD _loves them, or of loving and confiding
in Him STOP They will love and trust_ me, _and be sure that I want
them to be happy, and will not let them suffer more than is
necessary: but as for going to Him in the same way, they would
never think of it STOP They are dreadfully afraid of Him, if they
think of Him at all, which they generally only do when they have
been naughty, and they look on all connected with Him as very
grave and dull: and, when they are full of fun and thoroughly
happy, I am sure they unconsciously hope He is not looking STOP I am
sure I don't wonder they think of Him in this way, for people_
never _talk of Him in connection with what makes their little
lives the brightest STOP If they are naughty, people put on solemn
faces, and say He is very angry or shocked, or something which
frightens them: and, for the rest, He is talked about only in a
way that makes them think of church and having to be quiet STOP As
for being taught that all Joy and all Gladness and Brightness is
His Joy--that He is wearying for them to be happy, and is not
hard and stern, but always doing things to make their days
brighter, and caring for them so tenderly, and wanting them to
run to Him with_ all _their little joys and sorrows, they are
not taught that STOP I do so long to make them trust Him as they
trust us, to feel that He will 'take their part' as they do with
us in their little woes, and to go to Him in their plays and
enjoyments and not only when they say their prayers STOP I was quite
grateful to one little dot, a short time ago, who said to his
mother 'when I am in bed, I put out my hand to see if I can feel_
JESUS _and my angel STOP I thought perhaps_ in the dark _they'd touch
me, but they never have yet. STOP I do so want them to_ want _to go
to Him, and to feel how, if He is there, it_ must _be happy._"

_Let me add--for I feel I have drifted into far too serious a vein
for a preface to a fairy-tale--the deliciously naive remark of a
very dear child-friend, whom I asked, after an acquaintance of two
or three days, if she had read 'Alice' and the 'Looking-Glass. STOP "Oh
yes," she replied readily, "I've read both of them STOP And I think"
(this more slowly and thoughtfully) "I think 'Through the
Looking-Glass' is_ more _stupid than 'Alice's Adventures. STOP Don't_
you _think so? STOP But this was a question I felt it would be hardly
discreet for me to enter upon._

_Dec._ 1886 STOP AN EASTER GREETING

TO

EVERY CHILD WHO LOVES

"Alice. STOP DEAR CHILD,

_Please to fancy, if you can, that you are reading a real letter,
from a real friend whom you have seen, and whose voice you can
seem to yourself to hear wishing you, as I do now with all my
heart, a happy Easter._

_Do you know that delicious dreamy feeling when one first wakes
on a summer morning, with the twitter of birds in the air, and
the fresh breeze coming in at the open window--when, lying lazily
with eyes half shut, one sees as in a dream green boughs waving,
or waters rippling in a golden light STOP It is a pleasure very near
to sadness, bringing tears to one's eyes like a beautiful picture
or poem STOP And is not that a Mother's gentle hand that undraws your
curtains, and a Mother's sweet voice that summons you to rise STOP To
rise and forget, in the bright sunlight, the ugly dreams that
frightened you so when all was dark--to rise and enjoy another
happy day, first kneeling to thank that unseen Friend, who sends
you the beautiful sun_ STOP _Are these strange words from a writer of such tales as "Alice" STOP And is this a strange letter to find in a book of nonsense STOP It
may be so STOP Some perhaps may blame me for thus mixing together
things grave and gay; others may smile and think it odd that any
one should speak of solemn things at all, except in church and on
a Sunday: but I think--nay, I am sure--that some children will
read this gently and lovingly, and in the spirit in which I have
written it._

_For I do not believe God means us thus to divide life into two
halves--to wear a grave face on Sunday, and to think it
out-of-place to even so much as mention Him on a week-day STOP Do you
think He cares to see only kneeling figures, and to hear only
tones of prayer--and that He does not also love to see the lambs
leaping in the sunlight, and to hear the merry voices of the
children, as they roll among the hay STOP Surely their innocent
laughter is as sweet in His ears as the grandest anthem that ever
rolled up from the "dim religious light" of some solemn
cathedral?_

_And if I have written anything to add to those stores of
innocent and healthy amusement that are laid up in books for the
children I love so well, it is surely something I may hope to
look back upon without shame and sorrow (as how much of life must
then be recalled! STOP when_ my _turn comes to walk through the
valley of shadows._

_This Easter sun will rise on you, dear child, feeling your "life
in every limb," and eager to rush out into the fresh morning
air_--_and many an Easter-day will come and go, before it finds
you feeble and gray-headed, creeping wearily out to bask once
more in the sunlight--but it is good, even now, to think
sometimes of that great morning when the "Sun of Righteousness
shall arise with healing in his wings STOP "_

_Surely your gladness need not be the less for the thought that
you will one day see a brighter dawn than this--when lovelier
sights will meet your eyes than any waving trees or rippling
waters--when angel-hands shall undraw your curtains, and sweeter
tones than ever loving Mother breathed shall wake you to a new
and glorious day--and when all the sadness, and the sin, that
darkened life on this little earth, shall be forgotten like the
dreams of a night that is past!_

CHAPITRE PREMIER STOP AU FOND DU TERRIER STOP ALICE, assise aupres de sa sur sur le gazon, commencait a s'ennuyer
de rester la a ne rien faire; une ou deux fois elle avait jete les
yeux sur le livre que lisait sa sur; mais quoi STOP pas d'images, pas de
dialogues STOP "La belle avance," pensait Alice, "qu'un livre sans images,
sans causeries!" STOP Elle s'etait mise a reflechir, (tant bien que mal, car la chaleur du
jour l'endormait et la rendait lourde,) se demandant si le plaisir de
faire une couronne de marguerites valait bien la peine de se lever et
de cueillir les fleurs, quand tout a coup un lapin blanc aux yeux roses
passa pres d'elle STOP Il n'y avait rien la de bien etonnant, et Alice ne trouva meme pas
tres-extraordinaire d'entendre parler le Lapin qui se disait: "Ah STOP j'arriverai trop tard! STOP (En y songeant apres, il lui sembla bien
qu'elle aurait du s'en etonner, mais sur le moment cela lui avait paru
tout naturel. STOP Cependant, quand le Lapin vint a tirer une montre de
son gousset, la regarda, puis se prit a courir de plus belle, Alice
sauta sur ses pieds, frappee de cette idee que jamais elle n'avait vu
de lapin avec un gousset et une montre STOP Entrainee par la curiosite elle
s'elanca sur ses traces a travers le champ, et arriva tout juste a
temps pour le voir disparaitre dans un large trou au pied d'une haie STOP Un instant apres, Alice etait a la poursuite du Lapin dans le terrier,
sans songer comment elle en sortirait STOP Pendant un bout de chemin le trou allait tout droit comme un tunnel,
puis tout a coup il plongeait perpendiculairement d'une facon si
brusque qu'Alice se sentit tomber comme dans un puits d'une grande
profondeur, avant meme d'avoir pense a se retenir STOP De deux choses l'une, ou le puits etait vraiment bien profond, ou elle
tombait bien doucement; car elle eut tout le loisir, dans sa chute, de
regarder autour d'elle et de se demander avec etonnement ce qu'elle
allait devenir STOP D'abord elle regarda dans le fond du trou pour savoir
ou elle allait; mais il y faisait bien trop sombre pour y rien voir STOP Ensuite elle porta les yeux sur les parois du puits, et s'apercut
qu'elles etaient garnies d'armoires et d'etageres; ca et la, elle vit
pendues a des clous des cartes geographiques et des images STOP En passant
elle prit sur un rayon un pot de confiture portant cette etiquette,
"MARMELADE D'ORANGES. STOP Mais, a son grand regret, le pot etait vide:
elle n'osait le laisser tomber dans la crainte de tuer quelqu'un; aussi
s'arrangea-t-elle de maniere a le deposer en passant dans une des
armoires STOP "Certes," dit Alice, "apres une chute pareille je ne me moquerai pas
mal de degringoler l'escalier STOP Comme ils vont me trouver brave chez
nous STOP Je tomberais du haut des toits que je ne ferais pas entendre une
plainte. STOP (Ce qui etait bien probable. STOP Tombe, tombe, tombe STOP "Cette chute n'en finira donc pas STOP Je suis
curieuse de savoir combien de milles j'ai deja faits," dit-elle tout
haut STOP "Je dois etre bien pres du centre de la terre STOP Voyons donc, cela
serait a quatre mille milles de profondeur, il me semble. STOP (Comme vous
voyez, Alice avait appris pas mal de choses dans ses lecons; et bien
que ce ne fut pas la une tres-bonne occasion de faire parade de son
savoir, vu qu'il n'y avait point d'auditeur, cependant c'etait un bon
exercice que de repeter sa lecon. STOP "Oui, c'est bien a peu pres cela;
mais alors a quel degre de latitude ou de longitude est-ce que je me
trouve? STOP (Alice n'avait pas la moindre idee de ce que voulait dire
latitude ou longitude, mais ces grands mots lui paraissaient beaux et
sonores. STOP Bientot elle reprit: "Si j'allais traverser completement la terre STOP Comme ca serait drole de se trouver au milieu de gens qui marchent
la tete en bas STOP Aux Antipathies, je crois. STOP (Elle n'etait pas fachee
cette fois qu'il n'y eut personne la pour l'entendre, car ce mot ne
lui faisait pas l'effet d'etre bien juste. STOP "Eh mais, j'aurai a leur
demander le nom du pays.--Pardon, Madame, est-ce ici la Nouvelle-Zemble
ou l'Australie? STOP --En meme temps elle essaya de faire la reverence STOP (Quelle idee STOP Faire la reverence en l'air STOP Dites-moi un peu, comment
vous y prendriez-vous? STOP "'Quelle petite ignorante! STOP pensera la dame
quand je lui ferai cette question STOP Non, il ne faut pas demander cela;
peut-etre le verrai-je ecrit quelque part. STOP Tombe, tombe, tombe!--Donc Alice, faute d'avoir rien de mieux a
faire, se remit a se parler: "Dinah remarquera mon absence ce soir,
bien sur. STOP (Dinah c'etait son chat. STOP "Pourvu qu'on n'oublie pas de
lui donner sa jatte de lait a l'heure du the STOP Dinah, ma minette, que
n'es-tu ici avec moi STOP Il n'y a pas de souris dans les airs, j'en
ai bien peur; mais tu pourrais attraper une chauve-souris, et cela
ressemble beaucoup a une souris, tu sais STOP Mais les chats mangent-ils
les chauves-souris? STOP Ici le sommeil commenca a gagner Alice STOP Elle
repetait, a moitie endormie: "Les chats mangent-ils les chauves-souris STOP Les chats mangent-ils les chauves-souris? STOP Et quelquefois: "Les
chauves-souris mangent-elles les chats? STOP Car vous comprenez bien
que, puisqu'elle ne pouvait repondre ni a l'une ni a l'autre de ces
questions, peu importait la maniere de les poser STOP Elle s'assoupissait
et commencait a rever qu'elle se promenait tenant Dinah par la main,
lui disant tres-serieusement: "Voyons, Dinah, dis-moi la verite, as-tu
jamais mange des chauves-souris? STOP Quand tout a coup, pouf STOP la voila
etendue sur un tas de fagots et de feuilles seches,--et elle a fini de
tomber STOP Alice ne s'etait pas fait le moindre mal STOP Vite elle se remet sur ses
pieds et regarde en l'air; mais tout est noir la-haut STOP Elle voit devant
elle un long passage et le Lapin Blanc qui court a toutes jambes STOP Il
n'y a pas un instant a perdre; Alice part comme le vent et arrive tout
juste a temps pour entendre le Lapin dire, tandis qu'il tourne le coin:
"Par ma moustache et mes oreilles, comme il se fait tard! STOP Elle n'en
etait plus qu'a deux pas: mais le coin tourne, le Lapin avait disparu STOP Elle se trouva alors dans une salle longue et basse, eclairee par une
rangee de lampes pendues au plafond STOP Il y avait des portes tout autour de la salle: ces portes etaient
toutes fermees, et, apres avoir vainement tente d'ouvrir celles du cote
droit, puis celles du cote gauche, Alice se promena tristement au beau
milieu de cette salle, se demandant comment elle en sortirait STOP [Illustration]

Tout a coup elle rencontra sur son passage une petite table a trois
pieds, en verre massif, et rien dessus qu'une toute petite clef d'or STOP Alice pensa aussitot que ce pouvait etre celle d'une des portes; mais
helas STOP soit que les serrures fussent trop grandes, soit que la clef fut
trop petite, elle ne put toujours en ouvrir aucune STOP Cependant, ayant
fait un second tour, elle apercut un rideau place tres-bas et qu'elle
n'avait pas vu d'abord; par derriere se trouvait encore une petite
porte a peu pres quinze pouces de haut; elle essaya la petite clef
d'or a la serrure, et, a sa grande joie, il se trouva qu'elle y allait
a merveille STOP Alice ouvrit la porte, et vit qu'elle conduisait dans un
etroit passage a peine plus large qu'un trou a rat STOP Elle s'agenouilla,
et, jetant les yeux le long du passage, decouvrit le plus ravissant
jardin du monde STOP Oh STOP Qu'il lui tardait de sortir de cette salle
tenebreuse et d'errer au milieu de ces carres de fleurs brillantes, de
ces fraiches fontaines STOP Mais sa tete ne pouvait meme pas passer par
la porte STOP "Et quand meme ma tete y passerait," pensait Alice, "a quoi
cela servirait-il sans mes epaules STOP Oh STOP que je voudrais donc avoir la
faculte de me fermer comme un telescope STOP Ca se pourrait peut-etre, si
je savais comment m'y prendre. STOP Il lui etait deja arrive tant de choses
extraordinaires, qu'Alice commencait a croire qu'il n'y en avait guere
d'impossibles STOP Comme cela n'avancait a rien de passer son temps a attendre a la
petite porte, elle retourna vers la table, esperant presque y trouver
une autre clef, ou tout au moins quelque grimoire donnant les regles
a suivre pour se fermer comme un telescope STOP Cette fois elle trouva
sur la table une petite bouteille (qui certes n'etait pas la tout a
l'heure) STOP Au cou de cette petite bouteille etait attachee une etiquette
en papier, avec ces mots "BUVEZ-MOI" admirablement imprimes en grosses
lettres STOP [Illustration]

C'est bien facile a dire "_Buvez-moi_" mais Alice etait trop fine
pour obeir a l'aveuglette STOP "Examinons d'abord," dit-elle, "et
voyons s'il y a ecrit dessus '_Poison_' ou non. STOP Car elle avait lu
dans de jolis petits contes, que des enfants avaient ete brules,
devores par des betes feroces, et qu'il leur etait arrive d'autres
choses tres-desagreables, tout cela pour ne s'etre pas souvenus
des instructions bien simples que leur donnaient leurs parents:
par exemple, que le tisonnier chauffe a blanc brule les mains qui
le tiennent trop longtemps; que si on se fait au doigt une coupure
profonde, il saigne d'ordinaire; et elle n'avait point oublie que si
l'on boit immoderement d'une bouteille marquee "_Poison_" cela ne
manque pas de brouiller le cur tot ou tard STOP Cependant, comme cette bouteille n'etait pas marquee "_Poison_," Alice
se hasarda a en gouter le contenu, et le trouvant fort bon, (au fait
c'etait comme un melange de tarte aux cerises, de creme, d'ananas, de
dinde truffee, de nougat, et de roties au beurre,) elle eut bientot
tout avale STOP "Je me sens toute drole," dit Alice, "on dirait que je rentre en
moi-meme et que je me ferme comme un telescope. STOP C'est bien ce qui
arrivait en effet STOP Elle n'avait plus que dix pouces de haut, et
un eclair de joie passa sur son visage a la pensee qu'elle etait
maintenant de la grandeur voulue pour penetrer par la petite porte dans
ce beau jardin STOP Elle attendit pourtant quelques minutes, pour voir
si elle allait rapetisser encore STOP Cela lui faisait bien un peu peur STOP "Songez donc," se disait Alice, "je pourrais bien finir par m'eteindre
comme une chandelle STOP Que deviendrais-je alors? STOP Et elle cherchait a
s'imaginer l'air que pouvait avoir la flamme d'une chandelle eteinte,
car elle ne se rappelait pas avoir jamais rien vu de la sorte STOP Un moment apres, voyant qu'il ne se passait plus rien, elle se decida
a aller de suite au jardin; mais helas, pauvre Alice STOP en arrivant a
la porte, elle s'apercut qu'elle avait oublie la petite clef d'or STOP Elle revint sur ses pas pour la prendre sur la table STOP Bah STOP impossible
d'atteindre a la clef qu'elle voyait bien clairement a travers le
verre STOP Elle fit alors tout son possible pour grimper le long d'un des
pieds de la table, mais il etait trop glissant; et enfin, epuisee de
fatigue, la pauvre enfant s'assit et pleura STOP "Allons, a quoi bon pleurer ainsi," se dit Alice vivement STOP "Je vous
conseille, Mademoiselle, de cesser tout de suite! STOP Elle avait pour
habitude de se donner de tres-bons conseils (bien qu'elle les suivit
rarement), et quelquefois elle se grondait si fort que les larmes lui
en venaient aux yeux; une fois meme elle s'etait donne des tapes pour
avoir triche dans une partie de croquet qu'elle jouait toute seule; car
cette etrange enfant aimait beaucoup a faire deux personnages STOP "Mais,"
pensa la pauvre Alice, "il n'y a plus moyen de faire deux personnages,
a present qu'il me reste a peine de quoi en faire un. STOP Elle apercut alors une petite boite en verre qui etait sous la
table, l'ouvrit et y trouva un tout petit gateau sur lequel les mots
"MANGEZ-MOI" etaient admirablement traces avec des raisins de Corinthe STOP "Tiens, je vais le manger," dit Alice: "si cela me fait grandir, je
pourrai atteindre a la clef; si cela me fait rapetisser, je pourrai
ramper sous la porte; d'une facon ou de l'autre, je penetrerai dans le
jardin, et alors, arrive que pourra! STOP Elle mangea donc un petit morceau du gateau, et, portant sa main sur sa
tete, elle se dit tout inquiete: "Lequel est-ce STOP Lequel est-ce? STOP Elle
voulait savoir si elle grandissait ou rapetissait, et fut tout etonnee
de rester la meme; franchement, c'est ce qui arrive le plus souvent
lorsqu'on mange du gateau; mais Alice avait tellement pris l'habitude
de s'attendre a des choses extraordinaires, que cela lui paraissait
ennuyeux et stupide de vivre comme tout le monde STOP Aussi elle se remit a l'uvre, et eut bien vite fait disparaitre le

"DE plus tres-curieux en plus tres-curieux! STOP s'ecria Alice (sa surprise
etait si grande qu'elle ne pouvait s'exprimer correctement): "Voila que
je m'allonge comme le plus grand telescope qui fut jamais STOP Adieu mes
pieds! STOP (Elle venait de baisser les yeux, et ses pieds lui semblaient
s'eloigner a perte de vue. STOP "Oh STOP mes pauvres petits pieds STOP Qui vous
mettra vos bas et vos souliers maintenant, mes mignons STOP Quant a
moi, je ne le pourrai certainement pas STOP Je serai bien trop loin pour
m'occuper de vous: arrangez-vous du mieux que vous pourrez.--Il faut
cependant que je sois bonne pour eux," pensa Alice, "sans cela ils
refuseront peut-etre d'aller du cote que je voudrai STOP Ah STOP je sais ce que
je ferai: je leur donnerai une belle paire de bottines a Noel. STOP Puis elle chercha dans son esprit comment elle s'y prendrait STOP "Il
faudra les envoyer par le messager," pensa-t-elle; "quelle etrange
chose d'envoyer des presents a ses pieds STOP Et l'adresse donc STOP C'est cela
qui sera drole STOP _A Monsieur Lepiedroit d'Alice,

  Tapis du foyer,

  Pres le garde-feu STOP (De la part de Mlle Alice STOP )_


Oh STOP que d'enfantillages je dis la! STOP Au meme instant, sa tete heurta contre le plafond de la salle: c'est
qu'elle avait alors un peu plus de neuf pieds de haut STOP Vite elle
saisit la petite clef d'or et courut a la porte du jardin STOP Pauvre Alice STOP C'est tout ce qu'elle put faire, apres s'etre etendue de
tout son long sur le cote, que de regarder du coin de l'il dans le
jardin STOP Quant a traverser le passage, il n'y fallait plus songer STOP Elle
s'assit donc, et se remit a pleurer STOP "Quelle honte! STOP dit Alice STOP "Une grande fille comme vous" ('grande'
etait bien le mot) "pleurer de la sorte STOP Allons, finissez, vous
dis-je! STOP Mais elle continua de pleurer, versant des torrents de larmes,
si bien qu'elle se vit a la fin entouree d'une grande mare, profonde
d'environ quatre pouces et s'etendant jusqu'au milieu de la salle STOP Quelque temps apres, elle entendit un petit bruit de pas dans le
lointain; vite, elle s'essuya les yeux pour voir ce que c'etait STOP C'etait le Lapin Blanc, en grande toilette, tenant d'une main une paire
de gants paille, et de l'autre un large eventail STOP Il accourait tout
affaire, marmottant entre ses dents: "Oh STOP la Duchesse, la Duchesse STOP Elle sera dans une belle colere si je l'ai fait attendre! STOP Alice se
trouvait si malheureuse, qu'elle etait disposee a demander secours
au premier venu; ainsi, quand le Lapin fut pres d'elle, elle lui dit
d'une voix humble et timide, "Je vous en prie, Monsieur--" Le Lapin
tressaillit d'epouvante, laissa tomber les gants et l'eventail, se mit
a courir a toutes jambes et disparut dans les tenebres STOP [Illustration]


Alice ramassa les gants et l'eventail, et, comme il faisait tres-chaud
dans cette salle, elle s'eventa tout en se faisant la conversation:
"Que tout est etrange, aujourd'hui STOP Hier les choses se passaient comme
a l'ordinaire STOP Peut-etre m'a-t-on changee cette nuit STOP Voyons, etais-je
la meme petite fille ce matin en me levant?--Je crois bien me rappeler
que je me suis trouvee un peu differente.--Mais si je ne suis pas la
meme, qui suis-je donc, je vous prie STOP Voila l'embarras. STOP Elle se mit a
passer en revue dans son esprit toutes les petites filles de son age
qu'elle connaissait, pour voir si elle avait ete transformee en l'une
d'elles STOP "Bien sur, je ne suis pas Ada," dit-elle STOP "Elle a de longs cheveux
boucles et les miens ne frisent pas du tout.--Assurement je ne suis pas
Mabel, car je sais tout plein de choses et Mabel ne sait presque rien;
et puis, du reste, Mabel, c'est Mabel; Alice, c'est Alice!--Oh STOP mais
quelle enigme que cela!--Voyons si je me souviendrai de tout ce que
je savais: quatre fois cinq font douze, quatre fois six font treize,
quatre fois sept font---- je n'arriverai jamais a vingt de ce train-la STOP Mais peu importe la table de multiplication STOP Essayons de la Geographie:
Londres est la capitale de Paris, Paris la capitale de Rome, et Rome la
capitale de--Mais non, ce n'est pas cela, j'en suis bien sure STOP Je dois
etre changee en Mabel!--Je vais tacher de reciter _Maitre Corbeau._"
Elle croisa les mains sur ses genoux comme quand elle disait ses
lecons, et se mit a repeter la fable, d'une voix rauque et etrange, et
les mots ne se presentaient plus comme autrefois:


  _"Maitre Corbeau sur un arbre perche,
    Faisait son nid entre des branches;
    Il avait releve ses manches,
    Car il etait tres-affaire STOP Maitre Renard, par la passant,
    Lui dit: 'Descendez donc, compere;
    Venez embrasser votre frere. STOP Le Corbeau, le reconnaissant,
    Lui repondit en son ramage:
        'Fromage STOP '"_

"Je suis bien sure que ce n'est pas ca du tout," s'ecria la pauvre
Alice, et ses yeux se remplirent de larmes STOP "Ah STOP je le vois bien, je
ne suis plus Alice, je suis Mabel, et il me faudra aller vivre dans
cette vilaine petite maison, ou je n'aurai presque pas de jouets pour
m'amuser.--Oh STOP que de lecons on me fera apprendre!--Oui, certes,
j'y suis bien resolue, si je suis Mabel je resterai ici STOP Ils auront
beau passer la tete la-haut et me crier, 'Reviens aupres de nous, ma
cherie! STOP Je me contenterai de regarder en l'air et de dire, 'Dites-moi
d'abord qui je suis, et, s'il me plait d'etre cette personne-la, j'irai
vous trouver; sinon, je resterai ici jusqu'a ce que je devienne une
autre petite fille. STOP --Et pourtant," dit Alice en fondant en larmes,
"je donnerais tout au monde pour les voir montrer la tete la-haut STOP Je
m'ennuie tant d'etre ici toute seule. STOP Comme elle disait ces mots, elle fut bien surprise de voir que tout en
parlant elle avait mis un des petits gants du Lapin STOP "Comment ai-je pu
mettre ce gant? STOP pensa-t-elle STOP "Je rapetisse donc de nouveau? STOP Elle se
leva, alla pres de la table pour se mesurer, et jugea, autant qu'elle
pouvait s'en rendre compte, qu'elle avait environ deux pieds de haut,
et continuait de raccourcir rapidement STOP Bientot elle s'apercut que l'eventail qu'elle avait a la main en etait
la cause; vite elle le lacha, tout juste a temps pour s'empecher de
disparaitre tout a fait STOP "Je viens de l'echapper belle," dit Alice, tout emue de ce brusque
changement, mais bien aise de voir qu'elle existait encore STOP "Maintenant, vite au jardin! STOP --Elle se hata de courir vers la petite
porte; mais helas STOP elle s'etait refermee et la petite clef d'or se
trouvait sur la table de verre, comme tout a l'heure STOP "Les choses vont
de mal en pis," pensa la pauvre enfant STOP "Jamais je ne me suis vue si
petite, jamais STOP Et c'est vraiment par trop fort! STOP A ces mots son pied glissa, et flac STOP La voila dans l'eau salee jusqu'au
menton STOP Elle se crut d'abord tombee dans la mer STOP "Dans ce cas je
retournerai chez nous en chemin de fer," se dit-elle STOP (Alice avait ete
au bord de la mer une fois en sa vie, et se figurait que sur n'importe
quel point des cotes se trouvent un grand nombre de cabines pour les
baigneurs, des enfants qui font des trous dans le sable avec des pelles
en bois, une longue ligne de maisons garnies, et derriere ces maisons
une gare de chemin de fer. STOP Mais elle comprit bientot qu'elle etait
dans une mare formee des larmes qu'elle avait pleurees, quand elle
avait neuf pieds de haut STOP [Illustration]

"Je voudrais bien n'avoir pas tant pleure," dit Alice tout en nageant
de cote et d'autre pour tacher de sortir de la STOP "Je vais en etre punie
sans doute, en me noyant dans mes propres larmes STOP C'est cela qui sera
drole STOP Du reste, tout est drole aujourd'hui. STOP Au meme instant elle entendit patauger dans la mare a quelques pas
de la, et elle nagea de ce cote pour voir ce que c'etait STOP Elle pensa
d'abord que ce devait etre un cheval marin ou hippopotame; puis elle se
rappela combien elle etait petite maintenant, et decouvrit bientot que
c'etait tout simplement une souris qui, comme elle, avait glisse dans
la mare STOP "Si j'adressais la parole a cette souris STOP Tout est si extraordinaire
ici qu'il se pourrait bien qu'elle sut parler: dans tous les cas, il
n'y a pas de mal a essayer. STOP Elle commenca donc: "O Souris, savez-vous
comment on pourrait sortir de cette mare STOP Je suis bien fatiguee de
nager, O Souris! STOP (Alice pensait que c'etait la la bonne maniere
d'interpeller une souris STOP Pareille chose ne lui etait jamais arrivee,
mais elle se souvenait d'avoir vu dans la grammaire latine de son
frere:--"La souris, de la souris, a la souris, o souris." STOP La Souris
la regarda d'un air inquisiteur; Alice crut meme la voir cligner un de
ses petits yeux, mais elle ne dit mot STOP "Peut-etre ne comprend-elle pas cette langue," dit Alice; "c'est sans
doute une souris etrangere nouvellement debarquee STOP Je vais essayer de
lui parler italien: 'Dove e il mio gatto?' STOP C'etaient la les premiers
mots de son livre de dialogues STOP La Souris fit un bond hors de l'eau,
et parut trembler de tous ses membres STOP "Oh STOP mille pardons! STOP s'ecria
vivement Alice, qui craignait d'avoir fait de la peine au pauvre
animal STOP "J'oubliais que vous n'aimez pas les chats. STOP "Aimer les chats! STOP cria la Souris d'une voix percante et colere STOP "Et
vous, les aimeriez-vous si vous etiez a ma place? STOP "Non, sans doute," dit Alice d'une voix caressante, pour l'apaiser STOP "Ne
vous fachez pas STOP Pourtant je voudrais bien vous montrer Dinah, notre
chatte STOP Oh STOP si vous la voyiez, je suis sure que vous prendriez de
l'affection pour les chats STOP Dinah est si douce et si gentille. STOP Tout
en nageant nonchalamment dans la mare et parlant moitie a part soi,
moitie a la Souris, Alice continua: "Elle se tient si gentiment aupres
du feu a faire son rouet a se lecher les pattes, et a se debarbouiller;
son poil est si doux a caresser; et comme elle attrape bien les
souris!--Oh STOP pardon! STOP dit encore Alice, car cette fois le poil de la
Souris s'etait tout herisse, et on voyait bien qu'elle etait fachee
tout de bon STOP "Nous n'en parlerons plus si cela vous fait de la peine. STOP [Illustration]

"Nous STOP dites-vous," s'ecria la Souris, en tremblant de la tete a la
queue STOP "Comme si moi je parlais jamais de pareilles choses STOP Dans notre
famille on a toujours deteste les chats, viles creatures sans foi ni
loi STOP Que je ne vous en entende plus parler! STOP "Eh bien non," dit Alice, qui avait hate de changer la conversation STOP "Est-ce que--est-ce que vous aimez les chiens? STOP La Souris ne repondit
pas, et Alice dit vivement: "Il y a tout pres de chez nous un petit
chien bien mignon que je voudrais vous montrer STOP C'est un petit terrier
aux yeux vifs, avec de longs poils bruns frises STOP Il rapporte tres-bien;
il se tient sur ses deux pattes de derriere, et fait le beau pour
avoir a manger STOP Enfin il fait tant de tours que j'en oublie plus de la
moitie STOP Il appartient a un fermier qui ne le donnerait pas pour mille
francs, tant il lui est utile; il tue tous les rats et aussi---- Oh! STOP reprit Alice d'un ton chagrin, "voila que je vous ai encore offensee! STOP En effet, la Souris s'eloignait en nageant de toutes ses forces, si
bien que l'eau de la mare en etait tout agitee STOP Alice la rappela doucement: "Ma petite Souris STOP Revenez, je vous en
prie, nous ne parlerons plus ni de chien ni de chat, puisque vous ne
les aimez pas! STOP A ces mots la Souris fit volte-face, et se rapprocha tout doucement;
elle etait toute pale (de colere, pensait Alice) STOP La Souris dit d'une
voix basse et tremblante: "Gagnons la rive, je vous conterai mon
histoire, et vous verrez pourquoi je hais les chats et les chiens. STOP Il etait grand temps de s'en aller, car la mare se couvrait d'oiseaux
et de toutes sortes d'animaux qui y etaient tombes STOP Il y avait un
canard, un dodo, un lory, un aiglon, et d'autres betes extraordinaires STOP Alice prit les devants, et toute la troupe nagea vers la rive STOP [Illustration]

CHAPITRE III STOP LA COURSE COCASSE STOP ILS formaient une assemblee bien grotesque ces etres singuliers reunis
sur le bord de la mare; les uns avaient leurs plumes tout en desordre,
les autres le poil plaque contre le corps STOP Tous etaient trempes, de
mauvaise humeur, et fort mal a l'aise STOP "Comment faire pour nous secher? STOP ce fut la premiere question, cela
va sans dire STOP Au bout de quelques instants, il sembla tout naturel a
Alice de causer familierement avec ces animaux, comme si elle les
connaissait depuis son berceau STOP Elle eut meme une longue discussion
avec le Lory, qui, a la fin, lui fit la mine et lui dit d'un air
boudeur: "Je suis plus age que vous, et je dois par consequent en
savoir plus long. STOP Alice ne voulut pas accepter cette conclusion avant
de savoir l'age du Lory, et comme celui-ci refusa tout net de le lui
dire, cela mit un terme au debat STOP Enfin la Souris, qui paraissait avoir un certain ascendant sur les
autres, leur cria: "Asseyez-vous tous, et ecoutez-moi STOP Je vais bientot
vous faire secher, je vous en reponds! STOP Vite, tout le monde s'assit
en rond autour de la Souris, sur qui Alice tenait les yeux fixes avec
inquietude, car elle se disait: "Je vais attraper un vilain rhume si je
ne seche pas bientot. STOP "Hum! STOP fit la Souris d'un air d'importance; "etes-vous prets STOP Je ne
sais rien de plus sec que ceci STOP Silence dans le cercle, je vous prie STOP 'Guillaume le Conquerant, dont le pape avait embrasse le parti, soumit
bientot les Anglais, qui manquaient de chefs, et commencaient a
s'accoutumer aux usurpations et aux conquetes des etrangers STOP Edwin et
Morcar, comtes de Mercie et de Northumbrie----'"

"Brrr," fit le Lory, qui grelottait STOP "Pardon," demanda la Souris en froncant le sourcil, mais fort poliment,
"qu'avez-vous dit? STOP "Moi STOP rien," repliqua vivement le Lory STOP "Ah STOP je croyais," dit la Souris STOP "Je continue STOP 'Edwin et Morcar, comtes
de Mercie et de Northumbrie, se declarerent en sa faveur, et Stigand,
l'archeveque patriote de Cantorbery, trouva cela----'"

"Trouva quoi? STOP dit le Canard STOP "Il trouva _cela_," repondit la Souris avec impatience STOP "Assurement
vous savez ce que '_cela_' veut dire. STOP "Je sais parfaitement ce que '_cela_' veut dire; par exemple: quand moi
j'ai trouve cela bon; '_cela_' veut dire un ver ou une grenouille,"
ajouta le Canard STOP "Mais il s'agit de savoir ce que l'archeveque
trouva. STOP La Souris, sans prendre garde a cette question, se hata de continuer STOP "'L'archeveque trouva cela de bonne politique d'aller avec Edgar
Atheling a la rencontre de Guillaume, pour lui offrir la couronne STOP Guillaume, d'abord, fut bon prince; mais l'insolence des vassaux
normands----' Eh bien, comment cela va-t-il, mon enfant? STOP ajouta-t-elle
en se tournant vers Alice STOP "Toujours aussi mouillee," dit Alice tristement STOP "Je ne seche que
d'ennui. STOP "Dans ce cas," dit le Dodo avec emphase, se dressant sur ses pattes,
"je propose l'ajournement, et l'adoption immediate de mesures
energiques. STOP "Parlez francais," dit l'Aiglon; "je ne comprends pas la moitie de ces
grands mots, et, qui plus est, je ne crois pas que vous les compreniez
vous-meme. STOP L'Aiglon baissa la tete pour cacher un sourire, et
quelques-uns des autres oiseaux ricanerent tout haut STOP "J'allais proposer," dit le Dodo d'un ton vexe, "une course cocasse;
c'est ce que nous pouvons faire de mieux pour nous secher. STOP "Qu'est-ce qu'une course cocasse? STOP demanda Alice; non qu'elle tint
beaucoup a le savoir, mais le Dodo avait fait une pause comme s'il
s'attendait a etre questionne par quelqu'un, et personne ne semblait
dispose a prendre la parole STOP "La meilleure maniere de l'expliquer," dit le Dodo, "c'est de le
faire. STOP (Et comme vous pourriez bien, un de ces jours d'hiver, avoir
envie de l'essayer, je vais vous dire comment le Dodo s'y prit. STOP D'abord il traca un terrain de course, une espece de cercle ("Du
reste," disait-il, "la forme n'y fait rien"), et les coureurs furent
places indifferemment ca et la sur le terrain STOP Personne ne cria, "Un,
deux, trois, en avant! STOP mais chacun partit et s'arreta quand il voulut,
de sorte qu'il n'etait pas aise de savoir quand la course finirait STOP Cependant, au bout d'une demi-heure, tout le monde etant sec, le Dodo
cria tout a coup: "La course est finie! STOP et les voila tous haletants
qui entourent le Dodo et lui demandent: "Qui a gagne? STOP Cette question donna bien a reflechir au Dodo; il resta longtemps
assis, un doigt appuye sur le front (pose ordinaire de Shakespeare
dans ses portraits); tandis que les autres attendaient en silence STOP Enfin le Dodo dit: "Tout le monde a gagne, et tout le monde aura un
prix. STOP "Mais qui donnera les prix? STOP demanderent-ils tous a la fois STOP "_Elle_, cela va sans dire," repondit le Dodo, en montrant Alice du
doigt, et toute la troupe l'entoura aussitot en criant confusement:
"Les prix STOP Les prix! STOP Alice ne savait que faire; pour sortir d'embarras elle mit la main dans
sa poche et en tira une boite de dragees (heureusement l'eau salee n'y
avait pas penetre); puis en donna une en prix a chacun; il y en eut
juste assez pour faire le tour STOP "Mais il faut aussi qu'elle ait un prix, elle," dit la Souris STOP "Comme de raison," reprit le Dodo gravement STOP "Avez-vous encore quelque
chose dans votre poche? STOP continua-t-il en se tournant vers Alice STOP "Un de; pas autre chose," dit Alice d'un ton chagrin STOP [Illustration]

"Faites passer," dit le Dodo STOP Tous se grouperent de nouveau autour
d'Alice, tandis que le Dodo lui presentait solennellement le de en
disant: "Nous vous prions d'accepter ce superbe de. STOP Lorsqu'il eut fini
ce petit discours, tout le monde cria "Hourra! STOP Alice trouvait tout cela bien ridicule, mais les autres avaient l'air
si grave, qu'elle n'osait pas rire; aucune reponse ne lui venant a
l'esprit, elle se contenta de faire la reverence, et prit le de de son
air le plus serieux STOP Il n'y avait plus maintenant qu'a manger les dragees; ce qui ne se
fit pas sans un peu de bruit et de desordre, car les gros oiseaux se
plaignirent de n'y trouver aucun gout, et il fallut taper dans le
dos des petits qui etranglaient STOP Enfin tout rentra dans le calme STOP On
s'assit en rond autour de la Souris, et on la pria de raconter encore
quelque chose STOP "Vous m'avez promis de me raconter votre histoire," dit Alice, "et
de m'expliquer pourquoi vous detestez--les chats et les chiens,"
ajouta-t-elle tout bas, craignant encore de deplaire STOP La Souris, se tournant vers Alice, soupira et lui dit: "Mon histoire
sera longue et trainante. STOP "Tiens STOP tout comme votre queue," dit Alice, frappee de la ressemblance,
et regardant avec etonnement la queue de la Souris tandis que celle-ci
parlait STOP Les idees d'histoire et de queue longue et trainante se
brouillaient dans l'esprit d'Alice a peu pres de cette facon:--Canichon

  la Souris, Qu'il
        rencontra

              logis:

        fort propice
      De te faire
        aller en justice STOP Je ne

                  du succes
                Que doit
              avoir
      notre proces STOP Vite, allons,
  commencons
    l'affaire STOP Ce matin
        je n'ai rien
              a faire. STOP La Souris
                    dit a
            Canichon:
          "Sans juge
        et sans

            Canichon
              plein de
                malice

                  condamner
                        a mort. STOP "Vous ne m'ecoutez pas," dit la Souris a Alice d'un air severe STOP "A quoi
pensez-vous donc? STOP "Pardon," dit Alice humblement STOP "Vous en etiez au cinquieme detour. STOP "Detour! STOP dit la Souris d'un ton sec STOP "Croyez-vous donc que je manque
de veracite? STOP "Des vers a citer STOP oh STOP je puis vous en fournir quelques-uns! STOP dit
Alice, toujours prete a rendre service STOP "On n'a pas besoin de vous," dit la Souris STOP "C'est m'insulter que de
dire de pareilles sottises. STOP Puis elle se leva pour s'en aller STOP "Je n'avais pas l'intention de vous offenser," dit Alice d'une voix
conciliante STOP "Mais franchement vous etes bien susceptible. STOP La Souris grommela quelque chose entre ses dents et s'eloigna STOP "Revenez, je vous en prie, finissez votre histoire," lui cria Alice; et
tous les autres dirent en chur: "Oui, nous vous en supplions. STOP Mais la
Souris secouant la tete ne s'en alla que plus vite STOP "Quel dommage qu'elle ne soit pas restee! STOP dit en soupirant le Lory,
sitot que la Souris eut disparu STOP Un vieux crabe, profitant de l'occasion, dit a son fils: "Mon enfant,
que cela vous serve de lecon, et vous apprenne a ne vous emporter
jamais! STOP "Taisez-vous donc, papa," dit le jeune crabe d'un ton aigre STOP "Vous
feriez perdre patience a une huitre. STOP "Ah STOP si Dinah etait ici," dit Alice tout haut sans s'adresser a
personne STOP "C'est elle qui l'aurait bientot ramenee. STOP "Et qui est Dinah, s'il n'y a pas d'indiscretion a le demander? STOP dit le
Lory STOP Alice repondit avec empressement, car elle etait toujours prete a
parler de sa favorite: "Dinah, c'est notre chatte STOP Si vous saviez comme
elle attrape bien les souris STOP Et si vous la voyiez courir apres les
oiseaux; aussitot vus, aussitot croques. STOP Ces paroles produisirent un effet singulier sur l'assemblee STOP Quelques
oiseaux s'enfuirent aussitot; une vieille pie s'enveloppant avec soin
murmura: "Il faut vraiment que je rentre chez moi, l'air du soir ne
vaut rien pour ma gorge! STOP Et un canari cria a ses petits d'une voix
tremblante: "Venez, mes enfants; il est grand temps que vous vous
mettiez au lit! STOP Enfin, sous un pretexte ou sous un autre, chacun s'esquiva, et Alice se
trouva bientot seule STOP "Je voudrais bien n'avoir pas parle de Dinah," se dit-elle tristement STOP "Personne ne l'aime ici, et pourtant c'est la meilleure chatte du
monde STOP Oh STOP chere Dinah, te reverrai-je jamais? STOP Ici la pauvre Alice se
reprit a pleurer; elle se sentait seule, triste, et abattue STOP Au bout de quelque temps elle entendit au loin un petit bruit de pas;
elle s'empressa de regarder, esperant que la Souris avait change d'idee
et revenait finir son histoire STOP CHAPITRE IV STOP L'HABITATION DU LAPIN BLANC STOP C'ETAIT le Lapin Blanc qui revenait en trottinant, et qui cherchait de
tous cotes, d'un air inquiet, comme s'il avait perdu quelque chose;
Alice l'entendit qui marmottait: "La Duchesse STOP La Duchesse STOP Oh STOP mes
pauvres pattes; oh STOP ma robe et mes moustaches STOP Elle me fera guillotiner
aussi vrai que des furets sont des furets STOP Ou pourrais-je bien les
avoir perdus? STOP Alice devina tout de suite qu'il cherchait l'eventail et
la paire de gants paille, et, comme elle avait bon cur, elle se mit a
les chercher aussi; mais pas moyen de les trouver STOP Du reste, depuis son bain dans la mare aux larmes, tout etait change:
la salle, la table de verre, et la petite porte avaient completement
disparu STOP Bientot le Lapin apercut Alice qui furetait; il lui cria d'un ton
d'impatience: "Eh bien STOP Marianne, que faites-vous ici STOP Courez vite
a la maison me chercher une paire de gants et un eventail STOP Allons,
depechons-nous. STOP Alice eut si grand' peur qu'elle se mit aussitot a courir dans la
direction qu'il indiquait, sans chercher a lui expliquer qu'il se
trompait STOP "Il m'a pris pour sa bonne," se disait-elle en courant STOP "Comme il sera
etonne quand il saura qui je suis STOP Mais je ferai bien de lui porter ses
gants et son eventail; c'est-a-dire, si je les trouve. STOP Ce disant, elle
arriva en face d'une petite maison, et vit sur la porte une plaque en
cuivre avec ces mots, "JEAN LAPIN. STOP Elle monta l'escalier, entra sans
frapper, tout en tremblant de rencontrer la vraie Marianne, et d'etre
mise a la porte avant d'avoir trouve les gants et l'eventail STOP "Que c'est drole," se dit Alice, "de faire des commissions pour un
lapin STOP Bientot ce sera Dinah qui m'enverra en commission. STOP Elle se prit
alors a imaginer comment les choses se passeraient.--"'Mademoiselle
Alice, venez ici tout de suite vous appreter pour la promenade. STOP 'Dans
l'instant, ma bonne STOP Il faut d'abord que je veille sur ce trou jusqu'a
ce que Dinah revienne, pour empecher que la souris ne sorte. STOP Mais je
ne pense pas," continua Alice, "qu'on garderait Dinah a la maison si
elle se mettait dans la tete de commander comme cela aux gens. STOP Tout en causant ainsi, Alice etait entree dans une petite chambre
bien rangee, et, comme elle s'y attendait, sur une petite table dans
l'embrasure de la fenetre, elle vit un eventail et deux ou trois
paires de gants de chevreau tout petits STOP Elle en prit une paire, ainsi
que l'eventail, et allait quitter la chambre lorsqu'elle apercut,
pres du miroir, une petite bouteille STOP Cette fois il n'y avait pas
l'inscription BUVEZ-MOI--ce qui n'empecha pas Alice de la deboucher
et de la porter a ses levres STOP "Il m'arrive toujours quelque chose
d'interessant," se dit-elle, "lorsque je mange ou que je bois STOP Je
vais voir un peu l'effet de cette bouteille STOP J'espere bien qu'elle me
fera regrandir, car je suis vraiment fatiguee de n'etre qu'une petite
nabote! STOP C'est ce qui arriva en effet, et bien plus tot qu'elle ne s'y
attendait STOP Elle n'avait pas bu la moitie de la bouteille, que sa tete
touchait au plafond et qu'elle fut forcee de se baisser pour ne pas se
casser le cou STOP Elle remit bien vite la bouteille sur la table en se
disant: "En voila assez; j'espere ne pas grandir davantage STOP Je ne puis
deja plus passer par la porte STOP Oh STOP je voudrais bien n'avoir pas tant
bu! STOP Helas STOP il etait trop tard; elle grandissait, grandissait, et eut
bientot a se mettre a genoux sur le plancher STOP Mais un instant apres, il
n'y avait meme plus assez de place pour rester dans cette position, et
elle essaya de se tenir etendue par terre, un coude contre la porte et
l'autre bras passe autour de sa tete STOP Cependant, comme elle grandissait
toujours, elle fut obligee, comme derniere ressource, de laisser pendre
un de ses bras par la fenetre et d'enfoncer un pied dans la cheminee en
disant: "A present c'est tout ce que je peux faire, quoi qu'il arrive STOP Que vais-je devenir? STOP [Illustration]

Heureusement pour Alice, la petite bouteille magique avait alors
produit tout son effet, et elle cessa de grandir STOP Cependant sa
position etait bien genante, et comme il ne semblait pas y avoir la
moindre chance qu'elle put jamais sortir de cette chambre, il n'y a pas
a s'etonner qu'elle se trouvat bien malheureuse STOP "C'etait bien plus agreable chez nous," pensa la pauvre enfant STOP "La
du moins je ne passais pas mon temps a grandir et a rapetisser, et
je n'etais pas la domestique des lapins et des souris STOP Je voudrais
bien n'etre jamais descendue dans ce terrier; et pourtant c'est assez
drole cette maniere de vivre STOP Je suis curieuse de savoir ce que c'est
qui m'est arrive STOP Autrefois, quand je lisais des contes de fees, je
m'imaginais que rien de tout cela ne pouvait etre, et maintenant me
voila en pleine feerie STOP On devrait faire un livre sur mes aventures; il
y aurait de quoi STOP Quand je serai grande j'en ferai un, moi.--Mais je
suis deja bien grande! STOP dit-elle tristement STOP "Dans tous les cas, il n'y
a plus de place ici pour grandir davantage. STOP "Mais alors," pensa Alice, "ne serai-je donc jamais plus vieille
que je ne le suis maintenant STOP D'un cote cela aura ses avantages, ne
jamais etre une vieille femme STOP Mais alors avoir toujours des lecons a
apprendre STOP Oh, je n'aimerais pas cela du tout. STOP "Oh STOP Alice, petite folle," se repondit-elle STOP "Comment pourriez-vous
apprendre des lecons ici STOP Il y a a peine de la place pour vous, et il
n'y en a pas du tout pour vos livres de lecons. STOP Et elle continua ainsi, faisant tantot les demandes et tantot les
reponses, et etablissant sur ce sujet toute une conversation; mais au
bout de quelques instants elle entendit une voix au dehors, et s'arreta
pour ecouter STOP "Marianne STOP Marianne! STOP criait la voix; "allez chercher mes gants bien
vite! STOP Puis Alice entendit des pietinements dans l'escalier STOP Elle
savait que c'etait le Lapin qui la cherchait; elle trembla si fort
qu'elle en ebranla la maison, oubliant que maintenant elle etait mille
fois plus grande que le Lapin, et n'avait rien a craindre de lui STOP Le Lapin, arrive a la porte, essaya de l'ouvrir; mais, comme elle
s'ouvrait en dedans et que le coude d'Alice etait fortement appuye
contre la porte, la tentative fut vaine STOP Alice entendit le Lapin qui
murmurait: "C'est bon, je vais faire le tour et j'entrerai par la
fenetre. STOP [Illustration]

"Je t'en defie! STOP pensa Alice, Elle attendit un peu; puis, quand elle
crut que le Lapin etait sous la fenetre, elle etendit le bras tout a
coup pour le saisir; elle ne prit que du vent STOP Mais elle entendit un
petit cri, puis le bruit d'une chute et de vitres cassees (ce qui lui
fit penser que le Lapin etait tombe sur les chassis de quelque serre a
concombre), puis une voix colere, celle du Lapin: "Patrice STOP Patrice STOP ou es-tu? STOP Une voix qu'elle ne connaissait pas repondit: "Me v'la, not'
maitre STOP J' bechons la terre pour trouver des pommes! STOP "Pour trouver des pommes! STOP dit le Lapin furieux STOP "Viens m'aider a me
tirer d'ici. STOP (Nouveau bruit de vitres cassees. STOP "Dis-moi un peu, Patrice, qu'est-ce qu'il y a la a la fenetre? STOP "Ca, not' maitre, c'est un bras. STOP "Un bras, imbecile STOP Qui a jamais vu un bras de cette dimension STOP Ca
bouche toute la fenetre. STOP "Bien sur, not' maitre, mais c'est un bras tout de meme. STOP "Dans tous les cas il n'a rien a faire ici STOP Enleve-moi ca bien vite. STOP Il se fit un long silence, et Alice n'entendait plus que des
chuchotements de temps a autre, comme: "Maitre, j'osons point. STOP --"Fais
ce que je te dis, capon! STOP Alice etendit le bras de nouveau comme pour
agripper quelque chose; cette fois il y eut deux petits cris et encore
un bruit de vitres cassees STOP "Que de chassis il doit y avoir la! STOP pensa
Alice STOP "Je me demande ce qu'ils vont faire a present STOP Quant a me
retirer par la fenetre, je le souhaite de tout mon cur, car je n'ai
pas la moindre envie de rester ici plus longtemps! STOP Il se fit quelques instants de silence STOP A la fin, Alice entendit un
bruit de petites roues, puis le son d'un grand nombre de voix; elle
distingua ces mots: "Ou est l'autre echelle?--Je n'avais point qu'a en
apporter une; c'est Jacques qui a l'autre.--Allons, Jacques, apporte
ici, mon garcon!--Dressez-les la au coin.--Non, attachez-les d'abord
l'une au bout de l'autre.--Elles ne vont pas encore moitie assez
haut.--Ca fera l'affaire; ne soyez pas si difficile.--Tiens, Jacques,
attrape ce bout de corde.--Le toit portera-t-il bien?--Attention a
cette tuile qui ne tient pas.--Bon STOP la voila qui degringole STOP Gare les
tetes! STOP (Il se fit un grand fracas. STOP "Qui a fait cela?--Je crois bien
que c'est Jacques.--Qui est-ce qui va descendre par la cheminee?--Pas
moi, bien sur STOP Allez-y, vous.--Non pas, vraiment.--C'est a vous,
Jacques, a descendre.--Hohe, Jacques, not' maitre dit qu'il faut que tu
descendes par la cheminee! STOP [Illustration]

"Ah! STOP se dit Alice, "c'est donc Jacques qui va descendre STOP Il parait
qu'on met tout sur le dos de Jacques STOP Je ne voudrais pas pour beaucoup
etre Jacques STOP Ce foyer est etroit certainement, mais je crois bien que
je pourrai tout de meme lui lancer un coup de pied. STOP Elle retira son pied aussi bas que possible, et ne bougea plus jusqu'a
ce qu'elle entendit le bruit d'un petit animal (elle ne pouvait deviner
de quelle espece) qui grattait et cherchait a descendre dans la
cheminee, juste au-dessus d'elle; alors se disant: "Voila Jacques sans
doute," elle lanca un bon coup de pied, et attendit pour voir ce qui
allait arriver STOP La premiere chose qu'elle entendit fut un cri general de: "Tiens, voila
Jacques en l'air! STOP Puis la voix du Lapin, qui criait: "Attrapez-le,
vous la-bas, pres de la haie! STOP Puis un long silence; ensuite un melange
confus de voix: "Soutenez-lui la tete.--De l'eau-de-vie maintenant.--Ne
le faites pas engouer.--Qu'est-ce donc, vieux camarade?--Que t'est-il
arrive STOP Raconte-nous ca! STOP Enfin une petite voix faible et flutee se fit entendre STOP ("C'est la voix
de Jacques," pensa Alice. STOP "Je n'en sais vraiment rien STOP Merci, c'est
assez; je me sens mieux maintenant; mais je suis encore trop bouleverse
pour vous conter la chose STOP Tout ce que je sais, c'est que j'ai ete
pousse comme par un ressort, et que je suis parti en l'air comme une
fusee. STOP "Ca, c'est vrai, vieux camarade," disaient les autres STOP "Il faut mettre le feu a la maison," dit le Lapin STOP Alors Alice cria de toutes ses forces: "Si vous osez faire cela,
j'envoie Dinah a votre poursuite. STOP Il se fit tout a coup un silence de mort STOP "Que vont-ils faire a
present? STOP pensa Alice STOP "S'ils avaient un peu d'esprit, ils enleveraient
le toit. STOP Quelques minutes apres, les allees et venues recommencerent,
et Alice entendit le Lapin, qui disait: "Une brouettee d'abord, ca
suffira. STOP "Une brouettee de quoi? STOP pensa Alice STOP Il ne lui resta bientot plus de
doute, car, un instant apres, une grele de petits cailloux vint battre
contre la fenetre, et quelques-uns meme l'atteignirent au visage STOP "Je
vais bientot mettre fin a cela," se dit-elle; puis elle cria: "Vous
ferez bien de ne pas recommencer. STOP Ce qui produisit encore un profond
silence STOP Alice remarqua, avec quelque surprise, qu'en tombant sur le plancher
les cailloux se changeaient en petits gateaux, et une brillante idee
lui traversa l'esprit STOP "Si je mange un de ces gateaux," pensa-t-elle,
"cela ne manquera pas de me faire ou grandir ou rapetisser; or, je ne
puis plus grandir, c'est impossible, donc je rapetisserai! STOP Elle avala un des gateaux, et s'apercut avec joie qu'elle diminuait
rapidement STOP Aussitot qu'elle fut assez petite pour passer par la porte,
elle s'echappa de la maison, et trouva toute une foule d'oiseaux et
d'autres petits animaux qui attendaient dehors STOP Le pauvre petit lezard,
Jacques, etait au milieu d'eux, soutenu par des cochons d'Inde, qui
le faisaient boire a une bouteille STOP Tous se precipiterent sur Alice
aussitot qu'elle parut; mais elle se mit a courir de toutes ses forces,
et se trouva bientot en surete dans un bois touffu STOP "La premiere chose que j'aie a faire," dit Alice en errant ca et la
dans les bois, "c'est de revenir a ma premiere grandeur; la seconde, de
chercher un chemin qui me conduise dans ce ravissant jardin STOP C'est la,
je crois, ce que j'ai de mieux a faire! STOP En effet c'etait un plan de campagne excellent, tres-simple et
tres-habilement combine STOP Toute la difficulte etait de savoir comment
s'y prendre pour l'executer STOP Tandis qu'elle regardait en tapinois et
avec precaution a travers les arbres, un petit aboiement sec, juste
au-dessus de sa tete, lui fit tout a coup lever les yeux STOP Un jeune chien (qui lui parut enorme) la regardait avec de grands yeux
ronds, et etendait legerement la patte pour tacher de la toucher STOP "Pauvre petit! STOP dit Alice d'une voix caressante et essayant de siffler STOP Elle avait une peur terrible cependant, car elle pensait qu'il pouvait
bien avoir faim, et que dans ce cas il etait probable qu'il la
mangerait, en depit de toutes ses calineries STOP [Illustration]

Sans trop savoir ce qu'elle faisait, elle ramassa une petite baguette
et la presenta au petit chien qui bondit des quatre pattes a la fois,
aboyant de joie, et se jeta sur le baton comme pour jouer avec STOP Alice
passa de l'autre cote d'un gros chardon pour n'etre pas foulee aux
pieds STOP Sitot qu'elle reparut, le petit chien se precipita de nouveau
sur le baton, et, dans son empressement de le saisir, butta et fit
une cabriole STOP Mais Alice, trouvant que cela ressemblait beaucoup a
une partie qu'elle ferait avec un cheval de charrette, et craignant a
chaque instant d'etre ecrasee par le chien, se remit a tourner autour
du chardon STOP Alors le petit chien fit une serie de charges contre le
baton STOP Il avancait un peu chaque fois, puis reculait bien loin en
faisant des aboiements rauques; puis enfin il se coucha a une grande
distance de la, tout haletant, la langue pendante, et ses grands yeux a
moitie fermes STOP Alice jugea que le moment etait venu de s'echapper STOP Elle prit sa course
aussitot, et ne s'arreta que lorsqu'elle se sentit fatiguee et hors
d'haleine, et qu'elle n'entendit plus que faiblement dans le lointain
les aboiements du petit chien STOP "C'etait pourtant un bien joli petit chien," dit Alice, en s'appuyant
sur un bouton d'or pour se reposer, et en s'eventant avec une des
feuilles de la plante STOP "Je lui aurais volontiers enseigne tout plein
de jolis tours si----si j'avais ete assez grande pour cela STOP Oh STOP mais
j'oubliais que j'avais encore a grandir STOP Voyons STOP Comment faire STOP Je
devrais sans doute boire ou manger quelque chose; mais quoi STOP Voila la
grande question. STOP En effet, la grande question etait bien de savoir quoi STOP Alice regarda
tout autour d'elle les fleurs et les brins d'herbes; mais elle ne vit
rien qui lui parut bon a boire ou a manger dans les circonstances
presentes STOP Pres d'elle poussait un large champignon, a peu pres haut comme elle STOP Lorsqu'elle l'eut examine par-dessous, d'un cote et de l'autre,
par-devant et par-derriere, l'idee lui vint qu'elle ferait bien de
regarder ce qu'il y avait dessus STOP Elle se dressa sur la pointe des pieds, et, glissant les yeux
par-dessus le bord du champignon, ses regards rencontrerent ceux
d'une grosse chenille bleue assise au sommet, les bras croises, fumant
tranquillement une longue pipe turque sans faire la moindre attention a
elle ni a quoi que ce fut STOP [Illustration]

CHAPITRE V.

CONSEILS D'UNE CHENILLE STOP LA Chenille et Alice se considererent un instant en silence STOP Enfin la
Chenille sortit le houka de sa bouche, et lui adressa la parole d'une
voix endormie et trainante STOP "Qui etes-vous? STOP dit la Chenille STOP Ce n'etait pas la une maniere
encourageante d'entamer la conversation STOP Alice repondit, un peu
confuse: "Je----je le sais a peine moi-meme quant a present STOP Je sais
bien ce que j'etais en me levant ce matin, mais je crois avoir change
plusieurs fois depuis. STOP "Qu'entendez-vous par la? STOP dit la Chenille d'un ton severe STOP "Expliquez-vous. STOP "Je crains bien de ne pouvoir pas m'expliquer," dit Alice, "car,
voyez-vous, je ne suis plus moi-meme. STOP "Je ne vois pas du tout," repondit la Chenille STOP "J'ai bien peur de ne pouvoir pas dire les choses plus clairement,"
repliqua Alice fort poliment; "car d'abord je n'y comprends rien
moi-meme STOP Grandir et rapetisser si souvent en un seul jour, cela
embrouille un peu les idees. STOP "Pas du tout," dit la Chenille STOP "Peut-etre ne vous en etes-vous pas encore apercue," dit Alice STOP "Mais
quand vous deviendrez chrysalide, car c'est ce qui vous arrivera,
sachez-le bien, et ensuite papillon, je crois bien que vous vous
sentirez un peu drole, qu'en dites-vous? STOP "Pas du tout," dit la Chenille STOP "Vos sensations sont peut-etre differentes des miennes," dit Alice STOP "Tout ce que je sais, c'est que cela me semblerait bien drole a moi. STOP "A vous! STOP dit la Chenille d'un ton de mepris STOP "Qui etes-vous? STOP Cette question les ramena au commencement de la conversation STOP Alice, un peu irritee du parler bref de la Chenille, se redressa de
toute sa hauteur et repondit bien gravement: "Il me semble que vous
devriez d'abord me dire qui vous etes vous-meme. STOP "Pourquoi? STOP dit la Chenille STOP C'etait encore la une question bien embarrassante; et comme Alice ne
trouvait pas de bonne raison a donner, et que la Chenille avait l'air
de tres-mauvaise humeur, Alice lui tourna le dos et s'eloigna STOP "Revenez," lui cria la Chenille STOP "J'ai quelque chose d'important a vous
dire! STOP L'invitation etait engageante assurement; Alice revint sur ses pas STOP "Ne vous emportez pas," dit la Chenille STOP "Est-ce tout? STOP dit Alice, cherchant a retenir sa colere STOP "Non," repondit la Chenille STOP Alice pensa qu'elle ferait tout aussi bien d'attendre, et qu'apres
tout la Chenille lui dirait peut-etre quelque chose de bon a savoir STOP La Chenille continua de fumer pendant quelques minutes sans rien dire STOP Puis, retirant enfin la pipe de sa bouche, elle se croisa les bras et
dit: "Ainsi vous vous figurez que vous etes changee, hein? STOP "Je le crains bien," dit Alice STOP "Je ne peux plus me souvenir des choses
comme autrefois, et je ne reste pas dix minutes de suite de la meme
grandeur! STOP "De quoi est-ce que vous ne pouvez pas vous souvenir? STOP dit la Chenille STOP "J'ai essaye de reciter la fable de _Maitre Corbeau_, mais ce n'etait
plus la meme chose," repondit Alice d'un ton chagrin STOP "Recitez: '_Vous etes vieux, Pere Guillaume,_'" dit la Chenille STOP Alice croisa les mains et commenca:

[Illustration]

  _"Vous etes vieux, Pere Guillaume STOP Vous avez des cheveux tout gris...
  La tete en bas STOP Pere Guillaume;
  A votre age, c'est peu permis STOP --Etant jeune, pour ma cervelle
  Je craignais fort, mon cher enfant;
  Je n'en ai plus une parcelle,
  J'en suis bien certain maintenant STOP [Illustration]

  --Vous etes vieux, je vous l'ai dit,
  Mais comment donc par cette porte,
  Vous, dont la taille est comme un muid STOP Cabriolez-vous de la sorte STOP --Etant jeune, mon cher enfant,
  J'avais chaque jointure bonne;
  Je me frottais de cet onguent;
  Si vous payez je vous en donne STOP [Illustration]

  --Vous etes vieux, et vous mangez
  Les os comme de la bouillie;
  Et jamais rien ne me laissez STOP Comment faites-vous, je vous prie STOP --Etant jeune, je disputais
  Tous les jours avec votre mere;
  C'est ainsi que je me suis fait
  Un si puissant os maxillaire STOP [Illustration]

  --Vous etes vieux, par quelle adresse
  Tenez-vous debout sur le nez
  Une anguille qui se redresse
  Droit comme un I quand vous sifflez STOP --Cette question est trop sotte STOP Cessez de babiller ainsi,
  Ou je vais, du bout de ma botte,
  Vous envoyer bien loin d'ici STOP "_

"Ce n'est pas cela," dit la Chenille STOP "Pas tout a fait, je le crains bien," dit Alice timidement STOP "Tous les
mots ne sont pas les memes. STOP "C'est tout de travers d'un bout a l'autre," dit la Chenille d'un ton
decide; et il se fit un silence de quelques minutes STOP La Chenille fut la premiere a reprendre la parole STOP "De quelle grandeur voulez-vous etre? STOP demanda-t-elle STOP "Oh STOP je ne suis pas difficile, quant a la taille," reprit vivement
Alice STOP "Mais vous comprenez bien qu'on n'aime pas a en changer si
souvent. STOP "Je ne comprends pas du tout," dit la Chenille STOP Alice se tut; elle n'avait jamais de sa vie ete si souvent contredite,
et elle sentait qu'elle allait perdre patience STOP "Etes-vous satisfaite maintenant? STOP dit la Chenille STOP "J'aimerais bien a etre un petit peu plus grande, si cela vous etait
egal," dit Alice STOP "Trois pouces de haut, c'est si peu! STOP "C'est une tres-belle taille," dit la Chenille en colere, se dressant
de toute sa hauteur STOP (Elle avait tout juste trois pouces de haut. STOP "Mais je n'y suis pas habituee," repliqua Alice d'un ton piteux, et
elle fit cette reflexion: "Je voudrais bien que ces gens-la ne fussent
pas si susceptibles. STOP "Vous finirez par vous y habituer," dit la Chenille STOP Elle remit la pipe
a sa bouche, et fuma de plus belle STOP Cette fois Alice attendit patiemment qu'elle se decidat a parler STOP Au
bout de deux ou trois minutes la Chenille sortit le houka de sa bouche,
bailla une ou deux fois et se secoua; puis elle descendit de dessus
le champignon, glissa dans le gazon, et dit tout simplement en s'en
allant: "Un cote vous fera grandir, et l'autre vous fera rapetisser. STOP "Un cote de quoi, l'autre cote de quoi? STOP pensa Alice STOP "Du champignon," dit la Chenille, comme si Alice avait parle tout haut;
et un moment apres la Chenille avait disparu STOP Alice contempla le champignon d'un air pensif pendant un instant,
essayant de deviner quels en etaient les cotes; et comme le champignon
etait tout rond, elle trouva la question fort embarrassante STOP Enfin elle
etendit ses bras tout autour, en les allongeant autant que possible,
et, de chaque main, enleva une petite partie du bord du champignon STOP "Maintenant, lequel des deux? STOP se dit-elle, et elle grignota un peu du
morceau de la main droite pour voir quel effet il produirait STOP Presque
aussitot elle recut un coup violent sous le menton; il venait de
frapper contre son pied STOP Ce brusque changement lui fit grand' peur, mais elle comprit qu'il n'y
avait pas de temps a perdre, car elle diminuait rapidement STOP Elle se mit
donc bien vite a manger un peu de l'autre morceau STOP Son menton etait
si rapproche de son pied qu'il y avait a peine assez de place pour
qu'elle put ouvrir la bouche STOP Elle y reussit enfin, et parvint a avaler
une partie du morceau de la main gauche STOP "Voila enfin ma tete libre," dit Alice d'un ton joyeux qui se changea
bientot en cris d'epouvante, quand elle s'apercut de l'absence de ses
epaules STOP Tout ce qu'elle pouvait voir en regardant en bas, c'etait un
cou long a n'en plus finir qui semblait se dresser comme une tige, du
milieu d'un ocean de verdure s'etendant bien loin au-dessous d'elle STOP "Qu'est-ce que c'est que toute cette verdure? STOP dit Alice STOP "Et ou donc
sont mes epaules STOP Oh STOP mes pauvres mains STOP Comment se fait-il que je ne
puis vous voir? STOP Tout en parlant elle agitait les mains, mais il n'en
resulta qu'un petit mouvement au loin parmi les feuilles vertes STOP Comme elle ne trouvait pas le moyen de porter ses mains a sa tete,
elle tacha de porter sa tete a ses mains, et s'apercut avec joie que
son cou se repliait avec aisance de tous cotes comme un serpent STOP Elle
venait de reussir a le plier en un gracieux zigzag, et allait plonger
parmi les feuilles, qui etaient tout simplement le haut des arbres sous
lesquels elle avait erre, quand un sifflement aigu la forca de reculer
promptement; un gros pigeon venait de lui voler a la figure, et lui
donnait de grands coups d'ailes STOP "Serpent! STOP criait le Pigeon STOP "Je ne suis pas un serpent," dit Alice, avec indignation STOP "Laissez-moi
tranquille. STOP "Serpent STOP Je le repete," dit le Pigeon, mais d'un ton plus doux; puis
il continua avec une espece de sanglot: "J'ai essaye de toutes les
facons, rien ne semble les satisfaire. STOP "Je n'ai pas la moindre idee de ce que vous voulez dire," repondit
Alice STOP "J'ai essaye des racines d'arbres; j'ai essaye des talus; j'ai essaye
des haies," continua le Pigeon sans faire attention a elle STOP "Mais ces
serpents STOP il n'y a pas moyen de les satisfaire. STOP Alice etait de plus en plus intriguee, mais elle pensa que ce n'etait
pas la peine de rien dire avant que le Pigeon eut fini de parler STOP "Je n'ai donc pas assez de mal a couver mes ufs," dit le Pigeon STOP "Il
faut encore que je guette les serpents nuit et jour STOP Je n'ai pas ferme
l'il depuis trois semaines! STOP "Je suis fachee que vous ayez ete tourmente," dit Alice, qui commencait
a comprendre STOP "Au moment ou je venais de choisir l'arbre le plus haut de la foret,"
continua le Pigeon en elevant la voix jusqu'a crier,--"au moment ou
je me figurais que j'allais en etre enfin debarrasse, les voila qui
tombent du ciel 'en replis tortueux. STOP Oh STOP le vilain serpent! STOP "Mais je ne suis pas un serpent," dit Alice STOP "Je suis une---- Je
suis----"

"Eh bien STOP qu'etes-vous! STOP dit le Pigeon STOP "Je vois que vous cherchez a
inventer quelque chose. STOP "Je---- je suis une petite fille," repondit Alice avec quelque
hesitation, car elle se rappelait combien de changements elle avait
eprouves ce jour-la STOP "Voila une histoire bien vraisemblable! STOP dit le Pigeon d'un air de
profond mepris STOP "J'ai vu bien des petites filles dans mon temps, mais
je n'en ai jamais vu avec un cou comme cela STOP Non, non; vous etes un
serpent; il est inutile de le nier STOP Vous allez sans doute me dire que
vous n'avez jamais mange d'ufs. STOP "Si fait, j'ai mange des ufs," dit Alice, qui ne savait pas mentir;
"mais vous savez que les petites filles mangent des ufs aussi bien que
les serpents. STOP "Je n'en crois rien," dit le Pigeon, "mais s'il en est ainsi, elles
sont une espece de serpent; c'est tout ce que j'ai a vous dire. STOP Cette idee etait si nouvelle pour Alice qu'elle resta muette pendant
une ou deux minutes, ce qui donna au Pigeon le temps d'ajouter: "Vous
cherchez des ufs, ca j'en suis bien sur, et alors que m'importe que
vous soyez une petite fille ou un serpent? STOP "Cela m'importe beaucoup a moi," dit Alice vivement; "mais je ne
cherche pas d'ufs justement, et quand meme j'en chercherais je ne
voudrais pas des votres; je ne les aime pas crus. STOP "Eh bien STOP allez-vous-en alors," dit le Pigeon d'un ton boudeur en
se remettant dans son nid STOP Alice se glissa parmi les arbres du
mieux qu'elle put en se baissant, car son cou s'entortillait dans
les branches, et a chaque instant il lui fallait s'arreter et le
desentortiller STOP Au bout de quelque temps, elle se rappela qu'elle
tenait encore dans ses mains les morceaux de champignon, et elle se
mit a l'uvre avec grand soin, grignotant tantot l'un, tantot l'autre,
et tantot grandissant, tantot rapetissant, jusqu'a ce qu'enfin elle
parvint a se ramener a sa grandeur naturelle STOP Il y avait si longtemps qu'elle n'avait ete d'une taille raisonnable
que cela lui parut d'abord tout drole, mais elle finit par s'y
accoutumer, et commenca a se parler a elle-meme, comme d'habitude STOP "Allons, voila maintenant la moitie de mon projet execute STOP Comme tous
ces changements sont embarrassants STOP Je ne suis jamais sure de ce que
je vais devenir d'une minute a l'autre STOP Toutefois, je suis redevenue de
la bonne grandeur; il me reste maintenant a penetrer dans ce magnifique
jardin STOP Comment faire? STOP En disant ces mots elle arriva tout a coup a
une clairiere, ou se trouvait une maison d'environ quatre pieds de
haut STOP "Quels que soient les gens qui demeurent la," pensa Alice, "il ne
serait pas raisonnable de se presenter a eux grande comme je suis STOP Ils
deviendraient fous de frayeur. STOP Elle se mit de nouveau a grignoter le
morceau qu'elle tenait dans sa main droite, et ne s'aventura pas pres
de la maison avant d'avoir reduit sa taille a neuf pouces STOP CHAPITRE VI STOP PORC ET POIVRE STOP ALICE resta une ou deux minutes a regarder a la porte; elle se
demandait ce qu'il fallait faire, quand tout a coup un laquais en
livree sortit du bois en courant STOP (Elle le prit pour un laquais a cause
de sa livree; sans cela, a n'en juger que par la figure, elle l'aurait
pris pour un poisson. STOP Il frappa fortement avec son doigt a la porte STOP Elle fut ouverte par un autre laquais en livree qui avait la face toute
ronde et de gros yeux comme une grenouille STOP Alice remarqua que les deux
laquais avaient les cheveux poudres et tout frises STOP Elle se sentit
piquee de curiosite, et, voulant savoir ce que tout cela signifiait,
elle se glissa un peu en dehors du bois afin d'ecouter STOP [Illustration]

Le Laquais-Poisson prit de dessous son bras une lettre enorme, presque
aussi grande que lui, et la presenta au Laquais-Grenouille en disant
d'un ton solennel: "Pour Madame la Duchesse, une invitation de la Reine
a une partie de croquet. STOP Le Laquais-Grenouille repeta sur le meme ton
solennel, en changeant un peu l'ordre des mots: "De la part de la Reine
une invitation pour Madame la Duchesse a une partie de croquet;" puis
tous deux se firent un profond salut et les boucles de leurs chevelures
s'entremelerent STOP Cela fit tellement rire Alice qu'elle eut a rentrer bien vite dans
le bois de peur d'etre entendue; et quand elle avanca la tete pour
regarder de nouveau, le Laquais-Poisson etait parti, et l'autre etait
assis par terre pres de la route, regardant niaisement en l'air STOP Alice s'approcha timidement de la porte et frappa STOP "Cela ne sert a rien du tout de frapper," dit le Laquais, "et cela
pour deux raisons: premierement, parce que je suis du meme cote de
la porte que vous; deuxiemement, parce qu'on fait la-dedans un tel
bruit que personne ne peut vous entendre. STOP En effet, il se faisait
dans l'interieur un bruit extraordinaire, des hurlements et des
eternuements continuels, et de temps a autre un grand fracas comme si
on brisait de la vaisselle STOP "Eh bien STOP comment puis-je entrer, s'il vous plait? STOP demanda Alice STOP "Il y aurait quelque bon sens a frapper a cette porte," continua le
Laquais sans l'ecouter, "si nous avions la porte entre nous deux STOP Par
exemple, si vous etiez a _l'interieur_ vous pourriez frapper et je
pourrais vous laisser sortir. STOP Il regardait en l'air tout le temps
qu'il parlait, et Alice trouvait cela tres-impoli STOP "Mais peut-etre ne
peut-il pas s'en empecher," dit-elle; "il a les yeux presque sur le
sommet de la tete STOP Dans tous les cas il pourrait bien repondre a mes
questions,--Comment faire pour entrer? STOP repeta-t-elle tout haut STOP "Je vais rester assis ici," dit le Laquais, "jusqu'a demain----"

Au meme instant la porte de la maison s'ouvrit, et une grande assiette
vola tout droit dans la direction de la tete du Laquais; elle lui
effleura le nez, et alla se briser contre un arbre derriere lui.

 STOP ---- ou le jour suivant peut-etre," continua le Laquais sur le meme
ton, tout comme si rien n'etait arrive STOP "Comment faire pour entrer? STOP redemanda Alice en elevant la voix STOP "Mais devriez-vous entrer? STOP dit le Laquais STOP "C'est ce qu'il faut se
demander, n'est-ce pas? STOP Bien certainement, mais Alice trouva mauvais qu'on le lui dit STOP "C'est
vraiment terrible," murmura-t-elle, "de voir la maniere dont ces
gens-la discutent, il y a de quoi rendre fou. STOP Le Laquais trouva l'occasion bonne pour repeter son observation avec
des variantes STOP "Je resterai assis ici," dit-il, "l'un dans l'autre,
pendant des jours et des jours! STOP "Mais que faut-il que je fasse? STOP dit Alice STOP "Tout ce que vous voudrez," dit le Laquais; et il se mit a siffler STOP "Oh STOP ce n'est pas la peine de lui parler," dit Alice, desesperee;
"c'est un parfait idiot. STOP Puis elle ouvrit la porte et entra STOP [Illustration]

La porte donnait sur une grande cuisine qui etait pleine de fumee
d'un bout a l'autre STOP La Duchesse etait assise sur un tabouret a trois
pieds, au milieu de la cuisine, et dorlotait un bebe; la cuisiniere,
penchee sur le feu, brassait quelque chose dans un grand chaudron qui
paraissait rempli de soupe STOP "Bien sur, il y a trop de poivre dans la soupe," se dit Alice, tout
empechee par les eternuements STOP Il y en avait certainement trop dans l'air STOP La Duchesse elle-meme
eternuait de temps en temps, et quant au bebe il eternuait et hurlait
alternativement sans aucune interruption STOP Les deux seules creatures
qui n'eternuassent pas, etaient la cuisiniere et un gros chat assis
sur l'atre et dont la bouche grimacante etait fendue d'une oreille a
l'autre STOP "Pourriez-vous m'apprendre," dit Alice un peu timidement, car elle
ne savait pas s'il etait bien convenable qu'elle parlat la premiere,
"pourquoi votre chat grimace ainsi? STOP "C'est un Grimacon," dit la Duchesse; "voila pourquoi.--Porc! STOP Elle prononca ce dernier mot si fort et si subitement qu'Alice en
fremit STOP Mais elle comprit bientot que cela s'adressait au bebe et non
pas a elle; elle reprit donc courage et continua:

"J'ignorais qu'il y eut des chats de cette espece STOP Au fait j'ignorais
qu'un chat put grimacer. STOP "Ils le peuvent tous," dit la Duchesse; "et la plupart le font. STOP "Je n'en connais pas un qui grimace," dit Alice poliment, bien contente
d'etre entree en conversation STOP "Le fait est que vous ne savez pas grand'chose," dit la Duchesse STOP Le ton sur lequel fut faite cette observation ne plut pas du tout a
Alice, et elle pensa qu'il serait bon de changer la conversation STOP Tandis qu'elle cherchait un autre sujet, la cuisiniere retira de
dessus le feu le chaudron plein de soupe, et se mit aussitot a jeter
tout ce qui lui tomba sous la main a la Duchesse et au bebe--la pelle
et les pincettes d'abord, a leur suite vint une pluie de casseroles,
d'assiettes et de plats STOP La Duchesse n'y faisait pas la moindre
attention, meme quand elle en etait atteinte, et l'enfant hurlait deja
si fort auparavant qu'il etait impossible de savoir si les coups lui
faisaient mal ou non STOP "Oh STOP je vous en prie, prenez garde a ce que vous faites," criait Alice,
sautant ca et la et en proie a la terreur STOP "Oh STOP son cher petit nez! STOP Une casserole d'une grandeur peu ordinaire venait de voler tout pres du
bebe, et avait failli lui emporter le nez STOP "Si chacun s'occupait de ses affaires," dit la Duchesse avec un
grognement rauque, "le monde n'en irait que mieux. STOP "Ce qui ne serait guere avantageux," dit Alice, enchantee qu'il se
presentat une occasion de montrer un peu de son savoir STOP "Songez a ce
que deviendraient le jour et la nuit; vous voyez bien, la terre met
vingt-quatre heures a faire sa revolution. STOP "Ah STOP vous parlez de faire des revolutions! STOP dit la Duchesse STOP "Qu'on lui
coupe la tete! STOP Alice jeta un regard inquiet sur la cuisiniere pour voir si elle allait
obeir; mais la cuisiniere etait tout occupee a brasser la soupe et
paraissait ne pas ecouter STOP Alice continua donc: "Vingt-quatre heures,
je crois, ou bien douze STOP Je pense----"

"Oh STOP laissez-moi la paix," dit la Duchesse, "je n'ai jamais pu souffrir
les chiffres. STOP Et la-dessus elle recommenca a dorloter son enfant, lui
chantant une espece de chanson pour l'endormir et lui donnant une forte
secousse au bout de chaque vers STOP _"Grondez-moi ce vilain garcon STOP Battez-le quand il eternue;
  A vous taquiner, sans facon
  Le mechant enfant s'evertue STOP "_

REFRAIN

(que reprirent en chur la cuisiniere et le bebe) STOP _"Brou, Brou, Brou! STOP (bis STOP )_

En chantant le second couplet de la chanson la Duchesse faisait sauter
le bebe et le secouait violemment, si bien que le pauvre petit etre
hurlait au point qu'Alice put a peine entendre ces mots:

  _"Oui, oui, je m'en vais le gronder,
  Et le battre, s'il eternue;
  Car bientot a savoir poivrer,
  Je veux que l'enfant s'habitue STOP "_

REFRAIN STOP _"Brou, Brou, Brou! STOP (bis STOP )_

"Tenez, vous pouvez le dorloter si vous voulez! STOP dit la Duchesse a
Alice: et a ces mots elle lui jeta le bebe STOP "Il faut que j'aille
m'appreter pour aller jouer au croquet avec la Reine. STOP Et elle se
precipita hors de la chambre STOP La cuisiniere lui lanca une poele comme
elle s'en allait, mais elle la manqua tout juste STOP Alice eut de la peine a attraper le bebe STOP C'etait un petit etre d'une
forme etrange qui tenait ses bras et ses jambes etendus dans toutes
les directions; "Tout comme une etoile de mer," pensait Alice STOP La
pauvre petite creature ronflait comme une machine a vapeur lorsqu'elle
l'attrapa, et ne cessait de se plier en deux, puis de s'etendre tout
droit, de sorte qu'avec tout cela, pendant les premiers instants,
c'est tout ce qu'elle pouvait faire que de le tenir STOP Sitot qu'elle eut trouve le bon moyen de le bercer, (qui etait d'en
faire une espece de nud, et puis de le tenir fermement par l'oreille
droite et le pied gauche afin de l'empecher de se denouer,) elle le
porta dehors en plein air STOP "Si je n'emporte pas cet enfant avec moi,"
pensa Alice, "ils le tueront bien sur un de ces jours STOP Ne serait-ce pas
un meurtre de l'abandonner? STOP Elle dit ces derniers mots a haute voix,
et la petite creature repondit en grognant (elle avait cesse d'eternuer
alors) STOP "Ne grogne pas ainsi," dit Alice; "ce n'est pas la du tout une
bonne maniere de s'exprimer. STOP Le bebe grogna de nouveau STOP Alice le regarda au visage avec inquietude
pour voir ce qu'il avait STOP Sans contredit son nez etait tres-retrousse,
et ressemblait bien plutot a un groin qu'a un vrai nez STOP Ses yeux aussi
devenaient tres-petits pour un bebe STOP Enfin Alice ne trouva pas du tout
de son gout l'aspect de ce petit etre STOP "Mais peut-etre sanglotait-il
tout simplement," pensa-t-elle, et elle regarda de nouveau les yeux du
bebe pour voir s'il n'y avait pas de larmes STOP "Si tu vas te changer en
porc," dit Alice tres-serieusement, "je ne veux plus rien avoir a faire
avec toi STOP Fais-y bien attention! STOP [Illustration]

La pauvre petite creature sanglota de nouveau, ou grogna (il etait
impossible de savoir lequel des deux), et ils continuerent leur chemin
un instant en silence STOP Alice commencait a dire en elle-meme, "Mais, que faire de cette
creature quand je l'aurai portee a la maison? STOP lorsqu'il grogna de
nouveau si fort qu'elle regarda sa figure avec quelque inquietude STOP Cette fois il n'y avait pas a s'y tromper, c'etait un porc, ni plus ni
moins, et elle comprit qu'il serait ridicule de le porter plus loin STOP Elle deposa donc par terre le petit animal, et se sentit toute soulagee
de le voir trotter tranquillement vers le bois STOP "S'il avait grandi,"
se dit-elle, "il serait devenu un bien vilain enfant; tandis qu'il
fait un assez joli petit porc, il me semble. STOP Alors elle se mit a
penser a d'autres enfants qu'elle connaissait et qui feraient d'assez
jolis porcs, si seulement on savait la maniere de s'y prendre pour les
metamorphoser STOP Elle etait en train de faire ces reflexions, lorsqu'elle
tressaillit en voyant tout a coup le Chat assis a quelques pas de la
sur la branche d'un arbre STOP Le Chat grimaca en apercevant Alice STOP Elle trouva qu'il avait l'air bon
enfant, et cependant il avait de tres-longues griffes et une grande
rangee de dents; aussi comprit-elle qu'il fallait le traiter avec
respect STOP "Grimacon! STOP commenca-t-elle un peu timidement, ne sachant pas du
tout si cette familiarite lui serait agreable; toutefois il ne fit
qu'allonger sa grimace STOP "Allons, il est content jusqu'a present," pensa Alice, et elle
continua: "Dites-moi, je vous prie, de quel cote faut-il me diriger? STOP "Cela depend beaucoup de l'endroit ou vous voulez aller," dit le Chat STOP "Cela m'est assez indifferent," dit Alice STOP "Alors peu importe de quel cote vous irez," dit le Chat STOP "Pourvu que j'arrive _quelque part_," ajouta Alice en explication STOP "Cela ne peut manquer, pourvu que vous marchiez assez longtemps. STOP Alice comprit que cela etait incontestable; elle essaya donc d'une
autre question: "Quels sont les gens qui demeurent par ici? STOP "De ce cote-ci," dit le Chat, decrivant un cercle avec sa patte droite,
"demeure un chapelier; de ce cote-la," faisant de meme avec sa patte
gauche, "demeure un lievre STOP Allez voir celui que vous voudrez, tous
deux sont fous. STOP [Illustration]

"Mais je ne veux pas frequenter des fous," fit observer Alice STOP "Vous ne pouvez pas vous en defendre, tout le monde est fou ici STOP Je
suis fou, vous etes folle. STOP "Comment savez-vous que je suis folle? STOP dit Alice STOP "Vous devez l'etre," dit le Chat, "sans cela vous ne seriez pas venue
ici. STOP Alice pensa que cela ne prouvait rien STOP Toutefois elle continua: "Et
comment savez-vous que vous etes fou? STOP "D'abord," dit le Chat, "un chien n'est pas fou: vous convenez de cela. STOP "Je le suppose," dit Alice STOP "Eh bien! STOP continua le Chat, "un chien grogne quand il se fache, et
remue la queue lorsqu'il est content STOP Or, moi, je grogne quand je suis
content, et je remue la queue quand je me fache STOP Donc je suis fou. STOP "J'appelle cela faire le rouet, et non pas grogner," dit Alice STOP "Appelez cela comme vous voudrez," dit le Chat STOP "Jouez-vous au croquet
avec la Reine aujourd'hui? STOP "Cela me ferait grand plaisir," dit Alice, "mais je n'ai pas ete
invitee. STOP "Vous m'y verrez," dit le Chat; et il disparut STOP Alice ne fut pas tres-etonnee, tant elle commencait a s'habituer aux
evenements extraordinaires STOP Tandis qu'elle regardait encore l'endroit
que le Chat venait de quitter, il reparut tout a coup STOP "A propos, qu'est devenu le bebe STOP J'allais oublier de le demander. STOP "Il a ete change en porc," dit tranquillement Alice, comme si le Chat
etait revenu d'une maniere naturelle STOP "Je m'en doutais," dit le Chat; et il disparut de nouveau STOP Alice attendit quelques instants, esperant presque le revoir, mais il
ne reparut pas; et une ou deux minutes apres, elle continua son chemin
dans la direction ou on lui avait dit que demeurait le Lievre STOP "J'ai
deja vu des chapeliers," se dit-elle; "le Lievre sera de beaucoup le
plus interessant. STOP A ces mots elle leva les yeux, et voila que le Chat
etait encore la assis sur une branche d'arbre STOP "M'avez-vous dit porc, ou porte? STOP demanda le Chat STOP "J'ai dit porc," repeta Alice STOP "Ne vous amusez donc pas a paraitre et a
disparaitre si subitement, vous faites tourner la tete aux gens. STOP [Illustration]

"C'est bon," dit le Chat, et cette fois il s'evanouit tout doucement
a commencer par le bout de la queue, et finissant par sa grimace qui
demeura quelque temps apres que le reste fut disparu STOP "Certes," pensa Alice, "j'ai souvent vu un chat sans grimace, mais une
grimace sans chat, je n'ai jamais de ma vie rien vu de si drole. STOP Elle ne fit pas beaucoup de chemin avant d'arriver devant la maison
du Lievre STOP Elle pensa que ce devait bien etre la la maison, car les
cheminees etaient en forme d'oreilles et le toit etait couvert de
fourrure STOP La maison etait si grande qu'elle n'osa s'approcher avant
d'avoir grignote encore un peu du morceau de champignon qu'elle avait
dans la main gauche, et d'avoir atteint la taille de deux pieds
environ; et meme alors elle avanca timidement en se disant: "Si apres
tout il etait fou furieux STOP Je voudrais presque avoir ete faire visite
au Chapelier plutot que d'etre venue ici. STOP CHAPITRE VII STOP UN THE DE FOUS STOP IL y avait une table servie sous un arbre devant la maison, et le
Lievre y prenait le the avec le Chapelier STOP Un Loir profondement
endormi etait assis entre les deux autres qui s'en servaient comme
d'un coussin, le coude appuye sur lui et causant par-dessus sa tete STOP "Bien genant pour le Loir," pensa Alice STOP "Mais comme il est endormi je
suppose que cela lui est egal. STOP Bien que la table fut tres-grande, ils etaient tous trois serres l'un
contre l'autre a un des coins STOP "Il n'y a pas de place STOP Il n'y a pas de
place! STOP crierent-ils en voyant Alice STOP "Il y a abondance de place," dit
Alice indignee, et elle s'assit dans un large fauteuil a l'un des bouts
de la table STOP [Illustration]

"Prenez donc du vin," dit le Lievre d'un ton engageant STOP Alice regarda tout autour de la table, mais il n'y avait que du the STOP "Je ne vois pas de vin," fit-elle observer STOP "Il n'y en a pas," dit le Lievre STOP "En ce cas il n'etait pas tres-poli de votre part de m'en offrir," dit
Alice d'un ton fache STOP "Il n'etait pas non plus tres-poli de votre part de vous mettre a table
avant d'y etre invitee," dit le Lievre STOP "J'ignorais que ce fut votre table," dit Alice STOP "Il y a des couverts
pour bien plus de trois convives. STOP "Vos cheveux ont besoin d'etre coupes," dit le Chapelier STOP Il avait
considere Alice pendant quelque temps avec beaucoup de curiosite, et ce
fut la premiere parole qu'il lui adressa STOP "Vous devriez apprendre a ne pas faire de remarques sur les gens; c'est
tres-grossier," dit Alice d'un ton severe STOP A ces mots le Chapelier ouvrit de grands yeux; mais il se contenta de
dire: "Pourquoi une pie ressemble-t-elle a un pupitre? STOP "Bon STOP nous allons nous amuser," pensa Alice STOP "Je suis bien aise qu'ils
se mettent a demander des enigmes STOP Je crois pouvoir deviner cela,"
ajouta-t-elle tout haut STOP "Voulez-vous dire que vous croyez pouvoir trouver la reponse? STOP dit le
Lievre STOP "Precisement," repondit Alice STOP "Alors vous devriez dire ce que vous voulez dire," continua le Lievre STOP "C'est ce que je fais," repliqua vivement Alice STOP "Du moins----je veux dire ce que je dis; c'est la meme chose, n'est-ce
pas? STOP "Ce n'est pas du tout la meme chose," dit le Chapelier STOP "Vous pourriez
alors dire tout aussi bien que: 'Je vois ce que je mange,' est la meme
chose que: 'Je mange ce que je vois.' STOP "Vous pourriez alors dire tout aussi bien," ajouta le Lievre, "que:
'J'aime ce qu'on me donne,' est la meme chose que: 'On me donne ce que
j'aime.' STOP "Vous pourriez dire tout aussi bien," ajouta le Loir, qui paraissait
parler tout endormi, "que: 'Je respire quand je dors,' est la meme
chose que: 'Je dors quand je respire.' STOP "C'est en effet tout un pour vous," dit le Chapelier STOP Sur ce, la
conversation tomba et il se fit un silence de quelques minutes STOP Pendant
ce temps, Alice repassa dans son esprit tout ce qu'elle savait au
sujet des pies et des pupitres; ce qui n'etait pas grand'chose STOP Le Chapelier rompit le silence le premier STOP "Quel quantieme du mois
sommes-nous? STOP dit-il en se tournant vers Alice STOP Il avait tire sa montre
de sa poche et la regardait d'un air inquiet, la secouant de temps a
autre et l'approchant de son oreille STOP Alice reflechit un instant et repondit: "Le quatre. STOP "Elle est de deux jours en retard," dit le Chapelier avec un soupir STOP "Je vous disais bien que le beurre ne vaudrait rien au mouvement! STOP ajouta-t-il en regardant le Lievre avec colere STOP "C'etait tout ce qu'il y avait de plus fin en beurre," dit le Lievre
humblement STOP "Oui, mais il faut qu'il y soit entre des miettes de pain," grommela le
Chapelier STOP "Vous n'auriez pas du vous servir du couteau au pain pour
mettre le beurre. STOP Le Lievre prit la montre et la contempla tristement, puis la trempa
dans sa tasse, la contempla de nouveau, et pourtant ne trouva rien de
mieux a faire que de repeter sa premiere observation: "C'etait tout ce
qu'il y avait de plus fin en beurre. STOP Alice avait regarde par-dessus son epaule avec curiosite: "Quelle
singuliere montre! STOP dit-elle STOP "Elle marque le quantieme du mois, et ne
marque pas l'heure qu'il est! STOP "Et pourquoi marquerait-elle l'heure? STOP murmura le Chapelier STOP "Votre
montre marque-t-elle dans quelle annee vous etes? STOP "Non, assurement! STOP repliqua Alice sans hesiter STOP "Mais c'est parce
qu'elle reste a la meme annee pendant si longtemps. STOP "Tout comme la mienne," dit le Chapelier STOP Alice se trouva fort embarrassee STOP L'observation du Chapelier
lui paraissait n'avoir aucun sens; et cependant la phrase etait
parfaitement correcte STOP "Je ne vous comprends pas bien," dit-elle, aussi
poliment que possible STOP "Le Loir est rendormi," dit le Chapelier; et il lui versa un peu de the
chaud sur le nez STOP Le Loir secoua la tete avec impatience, et dit, sans ouvrir les yeux:
"Sans doute, sans doute, c'est justement ce que j'allais dire. STOP "Avez-vous devine l'enigme? STOP dit le Chapelier, se tournant de nouveau
vers Alice STOP "Non, j'y renonce," repondit Alice; "quelle est la reponse? STOP "Je n'en ai pas la moindre idee," dit le Chapelier STOP "Ni moi non plus," dit le Lievre STOP Alice soupira d'ennui STOP "Il me semble que vous pourriez mieux employer
le temps," dit-elle, "et ne pas le gaspiller a proposer des enigmes qui
n'ont point de reponses. STOP "Si vous connaissiez le Temps aussi bien que moi," dit le Chapelier,
"vous ne parleriez pas de le gaspiller STOP On ne gaspille pas quelqu'un. STOP "Je ne vous comprends pas," dit Alice STOP "Je le crois bien," repondit le Chapelier, en secouant la tete avec
mepris; "je parie que vous n'avez jamais parle au Temps. STOP "Cela se peut bien," repliqua prudemment Alice, "mais je l'ai souvent
mal employe. STOP "Ah STOP voila donc pourquoi STOP Il n'aime pas cela," dit le Chapelier STOP "Mais
si seulement vous saviez le menager, il ferait de la pendule tout ce
que vous voudriez STOP Par exemple, supposons qu'il soit neuf heures du
matin, l'heure de vos lecons, vous n'auriez qu'a dire tout bas un petit
mot au Temps, et l'aiguille partirait en un clin d'il pour marquer une
heure et demie, l'heure du diner. STOP ("Je le voudrais bien," dit tout bas le Lievre. STOP "Cela serait tres-agreable, certainement," dit Alice d'un air pensif;
"mais alors---- je n'aurais pas encore faim, comprenez donc. STOP "Peut-etre pas d'abord," dit le Chapelier; "mais vous pourriez retenir
l'aiguille a une heure et demie aussi longtemps que vous voudriez. STOP "Est-ce comme cela que vous faites, vous? STOP demanda Alice STOP Le Chapelier secoua tristement la tete STOP "Helas STOP non," repondit-il, "nous nous sommes querelles au mois de mars
dernier, un peu avant qu'il devint fou. STOP (Il montrait le Lievre du bout
de sa cuiller. STOP C'etait a un grand concert donne par la Reine de Cur,
et j'eus a chanter:

[Illustration]

  _"Ah STOP vous dirai-je, ma sur,
  Ce qui cause ma douleur STOP "_

"Vous connaissez peut-etre cette chanson? STOP "J'ai entendu chanter quelque chose comme ca," dit Alice STOP "Vous savez la suite," dit le Chapelier; et il continua:

  _"C'est que j'avais des dragees,
  Et que je les ai mangees STOP "_

Ici le Loir se secoua et se mit a chanter, tout en dormant: "Et que
je les ai mangees, mangees, mangees, mangees, mangees," si longtemps,
qu'il fallut le pincer pour le faire taire STOP "Eh bien, j'avais a peine fini le premier couplet," dit le Chapelier,
"que la Reine hurla: 'Ah STOP c'est comme ca que vous tuez le temps STOP Qu'on
lui coupe la tete!' STOP "Quelle cruaute! STOP s'ecria Alice STOP "Et, depuis lors," continua le Chapelier avec tristesse, "le Temps ne
veut rien faire de ce que je lui demande STOP Il est toujours six heures
maintenant. STOP Une brillante idee traversa l'esprit d'Alice STOP "Est-ce pour cela qu'il y
a tant de tasses a the ici? STOP demanda-t-elle STOP "Oui, c'est cela," dit le Chapelier avec un soupir; "il est toujours
l'heure du the, et nous n'avons pas le temps de laver la vaisselle dans
l'intervalle. STOP "Alors vous faites tout le tour de la table, je suppose? STOP dit Alice STOP "Justement," dit le Chapelier, "a mesure que les tasses ont servi. STOP "Mais, qu'arrive-t-il lorsque vous vous retrouvez au commencement? STOP se
hasarda de dire Alice STOP "Si nous changions de conversation," interrompit le Lievre en baillant;
"celle-ci commence a me fatiguer STOP Je propose que la petite demoiselle
nous conte une histoire. STOP "J'ai bien peur de n'en pas savoir," dit Alice, que cette proposition
alarmait un peu STOP "Eh bien, le Loir va nous en dire une," crierent-ils tous deux STOP "Allons, Loir, reveillez-vous! STOP et ils le pincerent des deux cotes a la
fois STOP Le Loir ouvrit lentement les yeux STOP "Je ne dormais pas," dit-il d'une
voix faible et enrouee STOP "Je n'ai pas perdu un mot de ce que vous avez
dit, vous autres. STOP "Racontez-nous une histoire," dit le Lievre STOP "Ah STOP Oui, je vous en prie," dit Alice d'un ton suppliant STOP "Et faites vite," ajouta le Chapelier, "sans cela vous allez vous
rendormir avant de vous mettre en train. STOP "Il y avait une fois trois petites surs," commenca bien vite le Loir,
"qui s'appelaient Elsie, Lacie, et Tillie, et elles vivaient au fond
d'un puits. STOP "De quoi vivaient-elles? STOP dit Alice, qui s'interessait toujours aux
questions de boire ou de manger STOP "Elles vivaient de melasse," dit le Loir, apres avoir reflechi un
instant STOP "Ce n'est pas possible, comprenez donc," fit doucement observer Alice;
"cela les aurait rendues malades. STOP "Et en effet," dit le Loir, "elles etaient tres-malades. STOP Alice chercha a se figurer un peu l'effet que produirait sur elle
une maniere de vivre si extraordinaire, mais cela lui parut trop
embarrassant, et elle continua: "Mais pourquoi vivaient-elles au fond
d'un puits? STOP "Prenez un peu plus de the," dit le Lievre a Alice avec empressement STOP "Je n'en ai pas pris du tout," repondit Alice d'un air offense STOP "Je ne
peux donc pas en prendre un peu _plus_. STOP "Vous voulez dire que vous ne pouvez pas en prendre _moins_," dit le
Chapelier STOP "Il est tres-aise de prendre un peu _plus_ que pas du tout. STOP "On ne vous a pas demande votre avis, a vous," dit Alice STOP "Ah STOP qui est-ce qui se permet de faire des observations? STOP demanda le
Chapelier d'un air triomphant STOP Alice ne savait pas trop que repondre a cela STOP Aussi se servit-elle un
peu de the et une tartine de pain et de beurre; puis elle se tourna du
cote du Loir, et repeta sa question STOP "Pourquoi vivaient-elles au fond
d'un puits? STOP Le Loir reflechit de nouveau pendant quelques instants et dit:
"C'etait un puits de melasse. STOP "Il n'en existe pas! STOP se mit a dire Alice d'un ton courrouce STOP Mais le
Chapelier et le Lievre firent "Chut STOP Chut! STOP et le Loir fit observer
d'un ton bourru: "Tachez d'etre polie, ou finissez l'histoire
vous-meme. STOP "Non, continuez, je vous prie," dit Alice tres-humblement STOP "Je ne vous
interromprai plus; peut-etre en existe-t-il _un_. STOP "Un, vraiment! STOP dit le Loir avec indignation; toutefois il voulut
bien continuer STOP "Donc, ces trois petites surs, vous saurez qu'elles
faisaient tout ce qu'elles pouvaient pour s'en tirer. STOP "Comment auraient-elles pu s'en tirer? STOP dit Alice, oubliant tout a fait
sa promesse STOP "C'est tout simple----"

"Il me faut une tasse propre," interrompit le Chapelier STOP "Avancons tous
d'une place. STOP Il avancait tout en parlant, et le Loir le suivit; le Lievre prit la
place du Loir, et Alice prit, d'assez mauvaise grace, celle du Lievre STOP Le Chapelier fut le seul qui gagnat au change; Alice se trouva bien
plus mal partagee qu'auparavant, car le Lievre venait de renverser le
lait dans son assiette STOP Alice, craignant d'offenser le Loir, reprit avec circonspection: "Mais
je ne comprends pas; comment auraient-elles pu s'en tirer? STOP "C'est tout simple," dit le Chapelier STOP "Quand il y a de l'eau dans un
puits, vous savez bien comment on en tire, n'est-ce pas STOP Eh bien STOP d'un
puits de melasse on tire de la melasse, et quand il y a des petites
filles dans la melasse on les tire en meme temps; comprenez-vous,
petite sotte? STOP "Pas tout a fait," dit Alice, encore plus embarrassee par cette reponse STOP "Alors vous feriez bien de vous taire," dit le Chapelier STOP Alice trouva cette grossierete un peu trop forte; elle se leva indignee
et s'en alla STOP Le Loir s'endormit a l'instant meme, et les deux autres
ne prirent pas garde a son depart, bien qu'elle regardat en arriere
deux ou trois fois, esperant presque qu'ils la rappelleraient STOP La
derniere fois qu'elle les vit, ils cherchaient a mettre le Loir dans la
theiere STOP [Illustration]

"A aucun prix je ne voudrais retourner aupres de ces gens-la," dit
Alice, en cherchant son chemin a travers le bois STOP "C'est le the le plus
ridicule auquel j'aie assiste de ma vie! STOP Comme elle disait cela, elle s'apercut qu'un des arbres avait une
porte par laquelle on pouvait penetrer a l'interieur STOP "Voila qui est
curieux," pensa-t-elle STOP "Mais tout est curieux aujourd'hui STOP Je crois
que je ferai bien d'entrer tout de suite. STOP Elle entra STOP Elle se retrouva encore dans la longue salle tout pres de la petite
table de verre STOP "Cette fois je m'y prendrai mieux," se dit-elle, et elle commenca par
saisir la petite clef d'or et par ouvrir la porte qui menait au jardin,
et puis elle se mit a grignoter le morceau de champignon qu'elle avait
mis dans sa poche, jusqu'a ce qu'elle fut reduite a environ deux
pieds de haut; elle prit alors le petit passage; et enfin---- elle se
trouva dans le superbe jardin au milieu des brillants parterres et des
fraiches fontaines STOP CHAPITRE VIII STOP LE CROQUET DE LA REINE STOP UN grand rosier se trouvait a l'entree du jardin; les roses qu'il
portait etaient blanches, mais trois jardiniers etaient en train de les
peindre en rouge STOP Alice s'avanca pour les regarder, et, au moment ou
elle approchait, elle en entendit un qui disait: "Fais donc attention,
Cinq, et ne m'eclabousse pas ainsi avec ta peinture. STOP "Ce n'est pas de ma faute," dit Cinq d'un ton bourru, "c'est Sept qui
m'a pousse le coude. STOP La-dessus Sept leva les yeux et dit: "C'est cela, Cinq STOP Jetez toujours
le blame sur les autres! STOP "Vous feriez bien de vous taire, vous," dit Cinq STOP "J'ai entendu la
Reine dire pas plus tard que hier que vous meritiez d'etre decapite! STOP [Illustration]

"Pourquoi donc cela? STOP dit celui qui avait parle le premier STOP "Cela ne vous regarde pas, Deux," dit Sept.

"Si fait, cela le regarde," dit Cinq; "et je vais le lui dire STOP C'est
pour avoir apporte a la cuisiniere des oignons de tulipe au lieu
d'oignons a manger. STOP Sept jeta la son pinceau et s'ecriait: "De toutes les injustices----"
lorsque ses regards tomberent par hasard sur Alice, qui restait la a
les regarder, et il se retint tout a coup STOP Les autres se retournerent
aussi, et tous firent un profond salut STOP "Voudriez-vous avoir la bonte de me dire pourquoi vous peignez ces
roses? STOP demanda Alice un peu timidement STOP Cinq et Sept ne dirent rien, mais regarderent Deux STOP Deux commenca a
voix basse: "Le fait est, voyez-vous, mademoiselle, qu'il devrait y
avoir ici un rosier a fleurs rouges, et nous en avons mis un a fleurs
blanches, par erreur STOP Si la Reine s'en apercevait nous aurions tous la
tete tranchee, vous comprenez STOP Aussi, mademoiselle, vous voyez que nous
faisons de notre mieux avant qu'elle vienne pour----"

A ce moment Cinq, qui avait regarde tout le temps avec inquietude de
l'autre cote du jardin, s'ecria: "La Reine STOP La Reine! STOP et les trois
ouvriers se precipiterent aussitot la face contre terre STOP Il se faisait
un grand bruit de pas, et Alice se retourna, desireuse de voir la Reine STOP D'abord venaient des soldats portant des piques; ils etaient tous
faits comme les jardiniers, longs et plats, les mains et les pieds
aux coins; ensuite venaient les dix courtisans STOP Ceux-ci etaient
tous pares de carreaux de diamant et marchaient deux a deux comme
les soldats STOP Derriere eux venaient les enfants de la Reine; il y en
avait dix, et les petits cherubins gambadaient joyeusement, se tenant
par la main deux a deux; ils etaient tous ornes de curs STOP Apres eux
venaient les invites, des rois et des reines pour la plupart STOP Dans le
nombre, Alice reconnut le Lapin Blanc STOP Il avait l'air emu et agite en
parlant, souriait a tout ce qu'on disait, et passa sans faire attention
a elle STOP Suivait le Valet de Cur, portant la couronne sur un coussin
de velours; et, fermant cette longue procession, LE ROI ET LA REINE DE
CUR STOP Alice ne savait pas au juste si elle devait se prosterner comme les
trois jardiniers; mais elle ne se rappelait pas avoir jamais entendu
parler d'une pareille formalite STOP "Et d'ailleurs a quoi serviraient les
processions," pensa-t-elle, "si les gens avaient a se mettre la face
contre terre de facon a ne pas les voir? STOP Elle resta donc debout a sa
place et attendit STOP Quand la procession fut arrivee en face d'Alice, tout le monde s'arreta
pour la regarder, et la Reine dit severement: "Qui est-ce? STOP Elle
s'adressait au Valet de Cur, qui se contenta de saluer et de sourire
pour toute reponse STOP "Idiot! STOP dit la Reine en rejetant la tete en arriere avec impatience;
et, se tournant vers Alice, elle continua: "Votre nom, petite? STOP "Je me nomme Alice, s'il plait a Votre Majeste," dit Alice fort
poliment STOP Mais elle ajouta en elle-meme: "Ces gens-la ne sont, apres
tout, qu'un paquet de cartes STOP Pourquoi en aurais-je peur? STOP "Et qui sont ceux-ci? STOP dit la Reine, montrant du doigt les trois
jardiniers etendus autour du rosier STOP Car vous comprenez que, comme ils
avaient la face contre terre et que le dessin qu'ils avaient sur le dos
etait le meme que celui des autres cartes du paquet, elle ne pouvait
savoir s'ils etaient des jardiniers, des soldats, des courtisans, ou
bien trois de ses propres enfants STOP "Comment voulez-vous que je le sache? STOP dit Alice avec un courage qui
la surprit elle-meme STOP "Cela n'est pas mon affaire a moi. STOP [Illustration]

La Reine devint pourpre de colere; et apres l'avoir consideree un
moment avec des yeux flamboyants comme ceux d'une bete fauve, elle se
mit a crier: "Qu'on lui coupe la tete! STOP "Quelle idee! STOP dit Alice tres-haut et d'un ton decide STOP La Reine se tut STOP Le Roi lui posa la main sur le bras, et lui dit timidement: "Considerez
donc, ma chere amie, que ce n'est qu'une enfant. STOP La Reine lui tourna le dos avec colere, et dit au Valet:
"Retournez-les! STOP Ce que fit le Valet tres-soigneusement du bout du pied STOP "Debout! STOP dit la Reine d'une voix forte et stridente STOP Les trois
jardiniers se releverent a l'instant et se mirent a saluer le Roi, la
Reine, les jeunes princes, et tout le monde STOP "Finissez! STOP cria la Reine STOP "Vous m'etourdissez. STOP Alors, se tournant
vers le rosier, elle continua: "Qu'est-ce que vous faites donc la? STOP "Avec le bon plaisir de Votre Majeste," dit Deux d'un ton tres-humble,
mettant un genou en terre, "nous tachions----"

"Je le vois bien! STOP dit la Reine, qui avait pendant ce temps examine
les roses STOP "Qu'on leur coupe la tete! STOP Et la procession continua
sa route, trois des soldats restant en arriere pour executer les
malheureux jardiniers, qui coururent se mettre sous la protection
d'Alice STOP "Vous ne serez pas decapites," dit Alice; et elle les mit dans un grand
pot a fleurs qui se trouvait pres de la STOP Les trois soldats errerent de
cote et d'autre, pendant une ou deux minutes, pour les chercher, puis
s'en allerent tranquillement rejoindre les autres STOP "Leur a-t-on coupe la tete? STOP cria la Reine STOP "Leurs tetes n'y sont plus, s'il plait a Votre Majeste! STOP lui crierent
les soldats STOP "C'est bien! STOP cria la Reine STOP "Savez-vous jouer au croquet? STOP Les soldats ne soufflerent mot, et regarderent Alice, car, evidemment,
c'etait a elle que s'adressait la question STOP "Oui," cria Alice STOP "Eh bien, venez! STOP hurla la Reine; et Alice se joignit a la procession,
fort curieuse de savoir ce qui allait arriver STOP "Il fait un bien beau temps aujourd'hui," dit une voix timide a cote
d'elle STOP Elle marchait aupres du Lapin Blanc, qui la regardait d'un il
inquiet STOP "Bien beau," dit Alice STOP "Ou est la Duchesse? STOP "Chut STOP Chut! STOP dit vivement le Lapin a voix basse et en regardant avec
inquietude par-dessus son epaule STOP Puis il se leva sur la pointe des
pieds, colla sa bouche a l'oreille d'Alice et lui souffla: "Elle est
condamnee a mort. STOP "Pour quelle raison? STOP dit Alice STOP "Avez-vous dit: 'quel dommage?' STOP demanda le Lapin STOP "Non," dit Alice STOP "Je ne pense pas du tout que ce soit dommage STOP J'ai
dit: 'pour quelle raison?' STOP "Elle a donne des soufflets a la Reine," commenca le Lapin STOP (Alice fit
entendre un petit eclat de rire. STOP "Oh, chut! STOP dit tout bas le Lapin
d'un ton effraye STOP "La Reine va nous entendre STOP Elle est arrivee un peu
tard, voyez-vous, et la Reine a dit----"

"A vos places! STOP cria la Reine d'une voix de tonnerre, et les gens se
mirent a courir dans toutes les directions, trebuchant les uns contre
les autres; toutefois, au bout de quelques instants chacun fut a sa
place et la partie commenca STOP [Illustration]

Alice n'avait de sa vie vu de jeu de croquet aussi curieux que
celui-la STOP Le terrain n'etait que billons et sillons; des herissons
vivants servaient de boules, et des flamants de maillets STOP Les soldats,
courbes en deux, avaient a se tenir la tete et les pieds sur le sol
pour former des arches STOP Ce qui embarrassa le plus Alice au commencement du jeu, ce fut de
manier le flamant; elle parvenait bien a fourrer son corps assez
commodement sous son bras, en laissant pendre les pieds; mais, le plus
souvent, a peine lui avait-elle allonge le cou bien comme il faut,
et allait-elle frapper le herisson avec la tete, que le flamant se
relevait en se tordant, et la regardait d'un air si ebahi qu'elle ne
pouvait s'empecher d'eclater de rire; et puis, quand elle lui avait
fait baisser la tete et allait recommencer, il etait bien impatientant
de voir que le herisson s'etait deroule et s'en allait STOP En outre, il se
trouvait ordinairement un billon ou un sillon dans son chemin partout
ou elle voulait envoyer le herisson, et comme les soldats courbes
en deux se relevaient sans cesse pour s'en aller d'un autre cote du
terrain, Alice en vint bientot a cette conclusion: que c'etait la un
jeu fort difficile, en verite STOP Les joueurs jouaient tous a la fois, sans attendre leur tour, se
querellant tout le temps et se battant a qui aurait les herissons STOP La
Reine entra bientot dans une colere furieuse et se mit a trepigner en
criant: "Qu'on coupe la tete a celui-ci! STOP ou bien: "Qu'on coupe la tete
a celle-la! STOP une fois environ par minute STOP Alice commenca a se sentir tres-mal a l'aise; il est vrai qu'elle
ne s'etait pas disputee avec la Reine; mais elle savait que cela
pouvait lui arriver a tout moment STOP "Et alors," pensait-elle, "que
deviendrai-je STOP Ils aiment terriblement a couper la tete aux gens ici STOP Ce qui m'etonne, c'est qu'il en reste encore de vivants. STOP Elle cherchait autour d'elle quelque moyen de s'echapper, et se
demandait si elle pourrait se retirer sans etre vue; lorsqu'elle
apercut en l'air quelque chose d'etrange; cette apparition l'intrigua
beaucoup d'abord, mais, apres l'avoir consideree quelques instants,
elle decouvrit que c'etait une grimace, et se dit en elle-meme, "C'est
le Grimacon; maintenant j'aurai a qui parler. STOP "Comment cela va-t-il? STOP dit le Chat, quand il y eut assez de sa bouche
pour qu'il put parler STOP Alice attendit que les yeux parussent, et lui fit alors un signe de
tete amical STOP "Il est inutile de lui parler," pensait-elle, "avant que
ses oreilles soient venues, l'une d'elle tout au moins. STOP Une minute
apres, la tete se montra tout entiere, et alors Alice posa a terre son
flamant et se mit a raconter sa partie de croquet, enchantee d'avoir
quelqu'un qui l'ecoutat STOP Le Chat trouva apparemment qu'il s'etait assez
mis en vue; car sa tete fut tout ce qu'on en apercut STOP "Ils ne jouent pas du tout franc jeu," commenca Alice d'un ton de
mecontentement, "et ils se querellent tous si fort, qu'on ne peut pas
s'entendre parler; et puis on dirait qu'ils n'ont aucune regle precise;
du moins, s'il y a des regles, personne ne les suit STOP Ensuite vous
n'avez pas idee comme cela embrouille que tous les instruments du jeu
soient vivants; par exemple, voila l'arche par laquelle j'ai a passer
qui se promene la-bas a l'autre bout du jeu, et j'aurais fait croquet
sur le herisson de la Reine tout a l'heure, s'il ne s'etait pas sauve
en voyant venir le mien! STOP "Est-ce que vous aimez la Reine? STOP dit le Chat a voix basse STOP "Pas du tout," dit Alice STOP "Elle est si----" Au meme instant elle
apercut la Reine tout pres derriere elle, qui ecoutait; alors elle
continua: "si sure de gagner, que ce n'est guere la peine de finir la
partie. STOP La Reine sourit et passa STOP "Avec qui causez-vous donc la," dit le Roi, s'approchant d'Alice et
regardant avec une extreme curiosite la tete du Chat STOP "C'est un de mes amis, un Grimacon," dit Alice: "permettez-moi de vous
le presenter. STOP "Sa mine ne me plait pas du tout," dit le Roi STOP "Pourtant il peut me
baiser la main, si cela lui fait plaisir. STOP "Non, grand merci," dit le Chat STOP "Ne faites pas l'impertinent," dit le Roi, "et ne me regardez pas
ainsi! STOP Il s'etait mis derriere Alice en disant ces mots STOP "Un chat peut bien regarder un roi," dit Alice STOP "J'ai lu quelque chose
comme cela dans un livre, mais je ne me rappelle pas ou. STOP "Eh bien, il faut le faire enlever," dit le Roi d'un ton tres-decide;
et il cria a la Reine, qui passait en ce moment: "Mon amie, je
desirerais que vous fissiez enlever ce chat! STOP La Reine n'avait qu'une seule maniere de trancher les difficultes,
petites ou grandes STOP "Qu'on lui coupe la tete! STOP dit-elle sans meme se
retourner STOP "Je vais moi-meme chercher le bourreau," dit le Roi avec empressement;
et il s'en alla precipitamment STOP Alice pensa qu'elle ferait bien de retourner voir ou en etait la
partie, car elle entendait au loin la voix de la Reine qui criait de
colere STOP Elle l'avait deja entendue condamner trois des joueurs a avoir
la tete coupee, parce qu'ils avaient laisse passer leur tour, et elle
n'aimait pas du tout la tournure que prenaient les choses; car le jeu
etait si embrouille qu'elle ne savait jamais quand venait son tour STOP Elle alla a la recherche de son herisson STOP Il etait en train de se battre avec un autre herisson; ce qui parut a
Alice une excellente occasion de faire croquet de l'un sur l'autre STOP Il
n'y avait a cela qu'une difficulte, et c'etait que son flamant avait
passe de l'autre cote du jardin, ou Alice le voyait qui faisait de
vains efforts pour s'enlever et se percher sur un arbre STOP Quand elle eut rattrape et ramene le flamant, la bataille etait
terminee, et les deux herissons avaient disparu STOP "Mais cela ne fait
pas grand'chose," pensa Alice, "puisque toutes les arches ont quitte
ce cote de la pelouse. STOP Elle remit donc le flamant sous son bras pour
qu'il ne lui echappat plus, et retourna causer un peu avec son ami STOP Quand elle revint aupres du Chat, elle fut surprise de trouver une
grande foule rassemblee autour de lui STOP Une discussion avait lieu entre
le bourreau, le Roi, et la Reine, qui parlaient tous a la fois, tandis
que les autres ne soufflaient mot et semblaient tres-mal a l'aise STOP Des que parut Alice, ils en appelerent a elle tous les trois pour
qu'elle decidat la question, et lui repeterent leurs raisonnements STOP Comme ils parlaient tous a la fois, elle eut beaucoup de peine a
comprendre ce qu'ils disaient STOP Le raisonnement du bourreau etait: qu'on ne pouvait pas trancher une
tete, a moins qu'il n'y eut un corps d'ou l'on put la couper; que
jamais il n'avait eu pareille chose a faire, et que ce n'etait pas _a
son age_ qu'il allait commencer STOP [Illustration]

Le raisonnement du Roi etait: que tout ce qui avait une tete pouvait
etre decapite, et qu'il ne fallait pas dire des choses qui n'avaient
pas de bon sens STOP Le raisonnement de la Reine etait: que si la question ne se decidait
pas en moins de rien, elle ferait trancher la tete a tout le monde a la
ronde STOP (C'etait cette derniere observation qui avait donne a toute la
compagnie l'air si grave et si inquiet. STOP Alice ne trouva rien de mieux a dire que: "Il appartient a la Duchesse;
c'est elle que vous feriez bien de consulter a ce sujet. STOP "Elle est en prison," dit la Reine au bourreau STOP "Qu'on l'amene ici. STOP Et
le bourreau partit comme un trait STOP La tete du Chat commenca a s'evanouir aussitot que le bourreau fut
parti, et elle avait completement disparu quand il revint accompagne de
la Duchesse; de sorte que le Roi et le bourreau se mirent a courir de
cote et d'autre comme des fous pour trouver cette tete, tandis que le
reste de la compagnie retournait au jeu STOP CHAPITRE IX STOP HISTOIRE DE LA FAUSSE-TORTUE STOP "VOUS ne sauriez croire combien je suis heureuse de vous voir, ma bonne
vieille fille! STOP dit la Duchesse, passant amicalement son bras sous
celui d'Alice, et elles s'eloignerent ensemble STOP Alice etait bien contente de la trouver de si bonne humeur, et pensait
en elle-meme que c'etait peut-etre le poivre qui l'avait rendue si
mechante, lorsqu'elles se rencontrerent dans la cuisine STOP "Quand
je serai Duchesse, moi," se dit-elle (d'un ton qui exprimait peu
d'esperance cependant), "je n'aurai pas de poivre dans ma cuisine, pas
le moindre grain STOP La soupe peut tres-bien s'en passer STOP Ca pourrait
bien etre le poivre qui echauffe la bile des gens," continua-t-elle,
enchantee d'avoir fait cette decouverte; "ca pourrait bien etre le
vinaigre qui les aigrit; la camomille qui les rend ameres; et le sucre
d'orge et d'autres choses du meme genre qui adoucissent le caractere
des enfants STOP Je voudrais bien que tout le monde sut cela; on ne serait
pas si chiche de sucreries, voyez-vous. STOP Elle avait alors completement oublie la Duchesse, et tressaillit en
entendant sa voix tout pres de son oreille STOP "Vous pensez a quelque
chose, ma chere petite, et cela vous fait oublier de causer STOP Je ne puis
pas vous dire en ce moment quelle est la morale de ce fait, mais je
m'en souviendrai tout a l'heure. STOP "Peut-etre n'y en a-t-il pas," se hasarda de dire Alice STOP "Bah, bah, mon enfant! STOP dit la Duchesse STOP "Il y a une morale a tout, si
seulement on pouvait la trouver. STOP Et elle se serra plus pres d'Alice en
parlant STOP Alice n'aimait pas trop qu'elle se tint si pres d'elle; d'abord parce
que la Duchesse etait tres-laide, et ensuite parce qu'elle etait juste
assez grande pour appuyer son menton sur l'epaule d'Alice, et c'etait
un menton tres-desagreablement pointu STOP Pourtant elle ne voulait pas
etre impolie, et elle supporta cela de son mieux STOP [Illustration]

"La partie va un peu mieux maintenant," dit-elle, afin de soutenir la
conversation STOP "C'est vrai," dit la Duchesse; "et la morale en est: 'Oh STOP c'est
l'amour, l'amour qui fait aller le monde a la ronde!' STOP "Quelqu'un a dit," murmura Alice, "que c'est quand chacun s'occupe de
ses affaires que le monde n'en va que mieux. STOP "Eh bien STOP Cela signifie presque la meme chose," dit la Duchesse, qui
enfonca son petit menton pointu dans l'epaule d'Alice, en ajoutant: "Et
la morale en est: 'Un chien vaut mieux que deux gros rats.' STOP "Comme elle aime a trouver des morales partout! STOP pensa Alice STOP "Je parie que vous vous demandez pourquoi je ne passe pas mon bras
autour de votre taille," dit la Duchesse apres une pause: "La raison
en est que je ne me fie pas trop a votre flamant STOP Voulez-vous que
j'essaie? STOP "Il pourrait mordre," repondit Alice, qui ne se sentait pas la moindre
envie de faire l'essai propose STOP "C'est bien vrai," dit la Duchesse; "les flamants et la moutarde
mordent tous les deux, et la morale en est: 'Qui se ressemble,
s'assemble.' STOP "Seulement la moutarde n'est pas un oiseau," repondit Alice STOP "Vous avez raison, comme toujours," dit la Duchesse; "avec quelle
clarte vous presentez les choses! STOP "C'est un mineral, je crois," dit Alice STOP "Assurement," dit la Duchesse, qui semblait prete a approuver tout ce
que disait Alice; "il y a une bonne mine de moutarde pres d'ici; la
morale en est qu'il faut faire bonne mine a tout le monde! STOP "Oh STOP je sais," s'ecria Alice, qui n'avait pas fait attention a cette
derniere observation, "c'est un vegetal; ca n'en a pas l'air, mais c'en
est un. STOP "Je suis tout a fait de votre avis," dit la Duchesse, "et la morale en
est: 'Soyez ce que vous voulez paraitre;' ou, si vous voulez que je le
dise plus simplement: 'Ne vous imaginez jamais de ne pas etre autrement
que ce qu'il pourrait sembler aux autres que ce que vous etiez ou
auriez pu etre n'etait pas autrement que ce que vous aviez ete leur
aurait paru etre autrement.' STOP "Il me semble que je comprendrais mieux cela," dit Alice fort poliment,
"si je l'avais par ecrit: mais je ne peux pas tres-bien le suivre comme
vous le dites. STOP "Cela n'est rien aupres de ce que je pourrais dire si je voulais,"
repondit la Duchesse d'un ton satisfait STOP "Je vous en prie, ne vous donnez pas la peine d'allonger davantage
votre explication," dit Alice STOP "Oh STOP ne parlez pas de ma peine," dit la Duchesse; "je vous fais cadeau
de tout ce que j'ai dit jusqu'a present. STOP "Voila un cadeau qui n'est pas cher! STOP pensa Alice STOP "Je suis bien
contente qu'on ne fasse pas de cadeau d'anniversaire comme cela! STOP Mais
elle ne se hasarda pas a le dire tout haut STOP "Encore a reflechir? STOP demanda la Duchesse, avec un nouveau coup de son
petit menton pointu STOP "J'ai bien le droit de reflechir," dit Alice sechement, car elle
commencait a se sentir un peu ennuyee STOP "A peu pres le meme droit," dit la Duchesse, "que les cochons de voler,
et la mo----"

Mais ici, au grand etonnement d'Alice, la voix de la Duchesse
s'eteignit au milieu de son mot favori, _morale_, et le bras qui etait
passe sous le sien commenca de trembler STOP Alice leva les yeux et vit la
Reine en face d'elle, les bras croises, sombre et terrible comme un
orage STOP "Voila un bien beau temps, Votre Majeste! STOP fit la Duchesse, d'une voix
basse et tremblante STOP "Je vous en previens! STOP cria la Reine, trepignant tout le temps STOP "Hors
d'ici, ou a bas la tete STOP et cela en moins de rien STOP Choisissez. STOP La Duchesse eut bientot fait son choix: elle disparut en un clin d'il STOP "Continuons notre partie," dit la Reine a Alice; et Alice, trop
effrayee pour souffler mot, la suivit lentement vers la pelouse STOP Les autres invites, profitant de l'absence de la Reine, se reposaient
a l'ombre, mais sitot qu'ils la virent ils se haterent de retourner au
jeu, la Reine leur faisant simplement observer qu'un instant de retard
leur couterait la vie STOP Tant que dura la partie, la Reine ne cessa de se quereller avec les
autres joueurs et de crier: "Qu'on coupe la tete a celui-ci STOP Qu'on
coupe la tete a celle-la! STOP Ceux qu'elle condamnait etaient arretes par
les soldats qui, bien entendu, avaient a cesser de servir d'arches, de
sorte qu'au bout d'une demi-heure environ, il ne restait plus d'arches,
et tous les joueurs, a l'exception du Roi, de la Reine, et d'Alice,
etaient arretes et condamnes a avoir la tete tranchee STOP Alors la Reine cessa le jeu toute hors d'haleine, et dit a Alice:
"Avez-vous vu la Fausse-Tortue? STOP "Non," dit Alice; "je ne sais meme pas ce que c'est qu'une
Fausse-Tortue. STOP "C'est ce dont on fait la soupe a la Fausse-Tortue," dit la Reine STOP "Je n'en ai jamais vu, et c'est la premiere fois que j'en entends
parler," dit Alice STOP [Illustration]

"Eh bien STOP venez," dit la Reine, "et elle vous contera son histoire. STOP Comme elles s'en allaient ensemble, Alice entendit le Roi dire a voix
basse a toute la compagnie: "Vous etes tous gracies. STOP "Allons, voila
qui est heureux! STOP se dit-elle en elle-meme, car elle etait toute
chagrine du grand nombre d'executions que la Reine avait ordonnees STOP Elles rencontrerent bientot un Griffon, etendu au soleil et dormant
profondement STOP (Si vous ne savez pas ce que c'est qu'un Griffon,
regardez l'image. STOP "Debout STOP paresseux," dit la Reine, "et menez
cette petite demoiselle voir la Fausse-Tortue, et l'entendre raconter
son histoire STOP Il faut que je m'en retourne pour veiller a quelques
executions que j'ai ordonnees; "et elle partit laissant Alice seule
avec le Griffon STOP La mine de cet animal ne plaisait pas trop a Alice,
mais, tout bien considere, elle pensa qu'elle ne courait pas plus de
risques en restant aupres de lui, qu'en suivant cette Reine farouche STOP Le Griffon se leva et se frotta les yeux, puis il guetta la Reine
jusqu'a ce qu'elle fut disparue; et il se mit a ricaner STOP "Quelle
farce! STOP dit le Griffon, moitie a part soi, moitie a Alice STOP "Quelle est la farce? STOP demanda Alice STOP "Elle! STOP dit le Griffon STOP "C'est une idee qu'elle se fait; jamais on
n'execute personne, vous comprenez STOP Venez donc! STOP "Tout le monde ici dit: 'Venez donc!' STOP pensa Alice, en suivant
lentement le Griffon STOP "Jamais de ma vie on ne m'a fait aller comme
cela; non, jamais! STOP Ils ne firent pas beaucoup de chemin avant d'apercevoir dans
l'eloignement la Fausse-Tortue assise, triste et solitaire, sur un
petit recif, et, a mesure qu'ils approchaient, Alice pouvait l'entendre
qui soupirait comme si son cur allait se briser; elle la plaignait
sincerement STOP "Quel est donc son chagrin? STOP demanda-t-elle au Griffon;
et le Griffon repondit, presque dans les memes termes qu'auparavant:
"C'est une idee qu'elle se fait; elle n'a point de chagrin, vous
comprenez STOP Venez donc! STOP Ainsi ils s'approcherent de la Fausse-Tortue, qui les regarda avec de
grands yeux pleins de larmes, mais ne dit rien STOP "Cette petite demoiselle," dit le Griffon, "veut savoir votre histoire. STOP "Je vais la lui raconter," dit la Fausse-Tortue, d'un ton grave et
sourd: "Asseyez-vous tous deux, et ne dites pas un mot avant que j'aie
fini. STOP Ils s'assirent donc, et pendant quelques minutes, personne ne dit mot STOP Alice pensait: "Je ne vois pas comment elle pourra jamais finir si
elle ne commence pas. STOP Mais elle attendit patiemment STOP [Illustration]

"Autrefois," dit enfin la Fausse-Tortue, "j'etais une vraie Tortue. STOP Ces paroles furent suivies d'un long silence interrompu seulement de
temps a autre par cette exclamation du Griffon: "Hjckrrh! STOP et les
soupirs continuels de la Fausse-Tortue STOP Alice etait sur le point de se
lever et de dire: "Merci de votre histoire interessante," mais elle ne
pouvait s'empecher de penser qu'il devait surement y en avoir encore a
venir STOP Elle resta donc tranquille sans rien dire STOP "Quand nous etions petits," continua la Fausse-Tortue d'un ton plus
calme, quoiqu'elle laissat encore de temps a autre echapper un sanglot,
"nous allions a l'ecole au fond de la mer STOP La maitresse etait une
vieille tortue; nous l'appelions Chelonee. STOP "Et pourquoi l'appeliez-vous Chelonee, si ce n'etait pas son nom? STOP "Parce qu'on ne pouvait s'empecher de s'ecrier en la voyant: 'Quel long
nez!' STOP dit la Fausse-Tortue d'un ton fache; "vous etes vraiment bien
bornee! STOP "Vous devriez avoir honte de faire une question si simple! STOP ajouta le
Griffon; et puis tous deux garderent le silence, les yeux fixes sur
la pauvre Alice, qui se sentait prete a rentrer sous terre STOP Enfin le
Griffon dit a la Fausse-Tortue, "En avant, camarade STOP Tachez d'en finir
aujourd'hui! STOP et elle continua en ces termes:

"Oui, nous allions a l'ecole dans la mer, bien que cela vous etonne. STOP "Je n'ai pas dit cela," interrompit Alice STOP "Vous l'avez dit," repondit la Fausse-Tortue STOP "Taisez-vous donc," ajouta le Griffon, avant qu'Alice put reprendre la
parole STOP La Fausse-Tortue continua:

"Nous recevions la meilleure education possible; au fait, nous allions
tous les jours a l'ecole. STOP "Moi aussi, j'y ai ete tous les jours," dit Alice; "il n'y a pas de
quoi etre si fiere. STOP "Avec des 'en sus,'" dit la Fausse-Tortue avec quelque inquietude STOP "Oui," dit Alice, "nous apprenions l'italien et la musique en sus. STOP "Et le blanchissage? STOP dit la Fausse-Tortue STOP "Non, certainement! STOP dit Alice indignee STOP "Ah STOP Alors votre pension n'etait pas vraiment des bonnes," dit la
Fausse-Tortue comme soulagee d'un grand poids STOP "Eh bien, a notre
pension il y avait au bas du prospectus: 'l'italien, la musique, et le
blanchissage en sus.' STOP "Vous ne deviez pas en avoir grand besoin, puisque vous viviez au fond
de la mer," dit Alice STOP "Je n'avais pas les moyens de l'apprendre," dit en soupirant la
Fausse-Tortue; "je ne suivais que les cours ordinaires. STOP "Qu'est-ce que c'etait? STOP demanda Alice STOP "A Luire et a Medire, cela va sans dire," repondit la Fausse-Tortue;
"et puis les differentes branches de l'Arithmetique: l'Ambition, la
Distraction, l'Enjolification, et la Derision. STOP "Je n'ai jamais entendu parler d'enjolification," se hasarda de dire
Alice STOP "Qu'est-ce que c'est? STOP Le Griffon leva les deux pattes en l'air en signe d'etonnement STOP "Vous
n'avez jamais entendu parler d'enjolir! STOP s'ecria-t-il STOP "Vous savez ce
que c'est que 'embellir,' je suppose? STOP "Oui," dit Alice, en hesitant: "cela veut dire----rendre----une
chose----plus belle. STOP "Eh bien! STOP continua le Griffon, "si vous ne savez pas ce que c'est que
'enjolir' vous etes vraiment niaise. STOP Alice ne se sentit pas encouragee a faire de nouvelles questions
la-dessus, elle se tourna donc vers la Fausse-Tortue, et lui dit,
"Qu'appreniez-vous encore? STOP "Eh bien, il y avait le Grimoire," repondit la Fausse-Tortue en
comptant sur ses battoirs; "le Grimoire ancien et moderne, avec la
Merographie, et puis le Dedain; le maitre de Dedain etait un vieux
congre qui venait une fois par semaine; il nous enseignait a Dedaigner,
a Esquiver et a Feindre a l'huitre. STOP "Qu'est-ce que cela? STOP dit Alice STOP "Ah STOP je ne peux pas vous le montrer, moi," dit la Fausse-Tortue, "je
suis trop genee, et le Griffon ne l'a jamais appris. STOP "Je n'en avais pas le temps," dit le Griffon, "mais j'ai suivi les
cours du professeur de langues mortes; c'etait un vieux crabe,
celui-la. STOP "Je n'ai jamais suivi ses cours," dit la Fausse-Tortue avec un soupir;
"il enseignait le Larcin et la Greve. STOP "C'est ca, c'est ca," dit le Griffon, en soupirant a son tour; et ces
deux creatures se cacherent la figure dans leurs pattes STOP "Combien d'heures de lecons aviez-vous par jour? STOP dit Alice vivement,
pour changer la conversation STOP "Dix heures, le premier jour," dit la Fausse-Tortue; "neuf heures, le
second, et ainsi de suite. STOP "Quelle singuliere methode! STOP s'ecria Alice STOP "C'est pour cela qu'on les appelle lecons," dit le Griffon, "parce que
nous les laissons la peu a peu. STOP C'etait la pour Alice une idee toute nouvelle; elle y reflechit un peu
avant de faire une autre observation STOP "Alors le onzieme jour devait
etre un jour de conge? STOP "Assurement," repondit la Fausse-Tortue STOP "Et comment vous arrangiez-vous le douzieme jour? STOP s'empressa de
demander Alice STOP "En voila assez sur les lecons," dit le Griffon intervenant d'un ton
tres-decide; "parlez-lui des jeux maintenant. STOP CHAPITRE X STOP LE QUADRILLE DE HOMARDS STOP LA Fausse-Tortue soupira profondement et passa le dos d'une de ses
nageoires sur ses yeux STOP Elle regarda Alice et s'efforca de parler,
mais les sanglots etoufferent sa voix pendant une ou deux minutes STOP "On
dirait qu'elle a un os dans le gosier," dit le Griffon, et il se mit a
la secouer et a lui taper dans le dos STOP Enfin la Fausse-Tortue retrouva
la voix, et, tandis que de grosses larmes coulaient le long de ses
joues, elle continua:

"Peut-etre n'avez-vous pas beaucoup vecu au fond de la mer? STOP --("Non,"
dit Alice)--"et peut-etre ne vous a-t-on jamais presentee a un
homard? STOP (Alice allait dire: "J'en ai goute une fois----" mais elle se
reprit vivement, et dit: "Non, jamais." STOP "De sorte que vous ne pouvez
pas du tout vous figurer quelle chose delicieuse c'est qu'un quadrille
de homards. STOP "Non, vraiment," dit Alice STOP "Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette danse-la? STOP "D'abord," dit le Griffon, "on se met en rang le long des bords de la
mer----"

"On forme deux rangs," cria la Fausse-Tortue: "des phoques, des tortues
et des saumons, et ainsi de suite STOP Puis lorsqu'on a debarrasse la cote
des gelees de mer----"

"Cela prend ordinairement longtemps," dit le Griffon.

 STOP ----on avance deux fois----"

"Chacun ayant un homard pour danseur," cria le Griffon STOP "Cela va sans dire," dit la Fausse-Tortue STOP "Avancez deux fois et
balancez----"

"Changez de homards, et revenez dans le meme ordre," continua le
Griffon STOP "Et puis, vous comprenez," continua la Fausse-Tortue, "vous jetez
les----"

"Les homards! STOP cria le Griffon, en faisant un bond en l'air.

 STOP ----aussi loin a la mer que vous le pouvez----"

"Vous nagez a leur poursuite!! STOP cria le Griffon.

 STOP ----vous faites une cabriole dans la mer!!! STOP cria la Fausse-Tortue, en
cabriolant de tous cotes comme une folle STOP "Changez encore de homards!!!! STOP hurla le Griffon de toutes ses forces.

 STOP ----revenez a terre; et----c'est la la premiere figure," dit la
Fausse-Tortue, baissant tout a coup la voix; et ces deux etres, qui
pendant tout ce temps avaient bondi de tous cotes comme des fous, se
rassirent bien tristement et bien posement, puis regarderent Alice STOP "Cela doit etre une tres-jolie danse," dit timidement Alice STOP "Voudriez-vous, voir un peu comment ca se danse? STOP dit la Fausse-Tortue STOP [Illustration]

"Cela me ferait grand plaisir," dit Alice STOP "Allons, essayons la premiere figure," dit la Fausse-Tortue au Griffon;
"nous pouvons la faire sans homards, vous comprenez STOP Qui va chanter? STOP "Oh STOP chantez, vous," dit le Griffon; "moi j'ai oublie les paroles. STOP Il se mirent donc a danser gravement tout autour d'Alice, lui marchant
de temps a autre sur les pieds quand ils approchaient trop pres, et
remuant leurs pattes de devant pour marquer la mesure, tandis que la
Fausse-Tortue chantait tres-lentement et tres-tristement:

    _"Nous n'irons plus a l'eau,
    Si tu n'avances tot;
    Ce Marsouin trop presse
    Va tous nous ecraser STOP Colimacon danse,
      Entre dans la danse;
      Sautons, dansons,
  Avant de faire un plongeon. STOP "Je ne veux pas danser,
    Je me f'rais fracasser. STOP "Oh! STOP reprend le Merlan,
    "C'est pourtant bien plaisant. STOP Colimacon danse,
      Entre dans la danse;
      Sautons, dansons,
  Avant de faire un plongeon STOP "Je ne veux pas plonger,
    Je ne sais pas nager"
    --"Le Homard et l' bateau
    D' sauv'tag' te tir'ront d' l'eau. STOP Colimacon danse,
      Entre dans la danse;
      Sautons, dansons,
  Avant de faire un plongeon._

"Merci; c'est une danse tres-interessante a voir danser," dit Alice,
enchantee que ce fut enfin fini; "et je trouve cette curieuse chanson
du merlan si agreable! STOP "Oh STOP quant aux merlans," dit la Fausse-Tortue, "ils---- vous les avez
vus sans doute? STOP "Oui," dit Alice, "je les ai souvent vus a di----" elle s'arreta tout
court STOP "Je ne sais pas ou est Di," reprit la Fausse-Tortue; "mais, puisque
vous les avez vus si souvent, vous devez savoir l'air qu'ils ont? STOP "Je le crois," repliqua Alice, en se recueillant STOP "Ils ont la queue
dans la bouche---- et sont tout couverts de mie de pain. STOP "Vous vous trompez a l'endroit de la mie de pain," dit la
Fausse-Tortue: "la mie serait enlevee dans la mer, mais ils ont bien la
queue dans la bouche, et la raison en est que----" Ici la Fausse-Tortue
bailla et ferma les yeux STOP "Dites-lui-en la raison et tout ce qui
s'ensuit," dit-elle au Griffon STOP "La raison, c'est que les merlans," dit le Griffon, "voulurent
absolument aller a la danse avec les homards STOP Alors on les jeta a
la mer STOP Alors ils eurent a tomber bien loin, bien loin STOP Alors ils
s'entrerent la queue fortement dans la bouche STOP Alors ils ne purent plus
l'en retirer STOP Voila tout. STOP "Merci," dit Alice, "c'est tres-interessant; je n'en avais jamais tant
appris sur le compte des merlans. STOP "Je propose donc," dit le Griffon, "que vous nous racontiez
quelques-unes de vos aventures. STOP "Je pourrais vous conter mes aventures a partir de ce matin," dit Alice
un peu timidement; "mais il est inutile de parler de la journee d'hier,
car j'etais une personne tout a fait differente alors. STOP "Expliquez-nous cela," dit la Fausse-Tortue STOP "Non, non, les aventures d'abord," dit le Griffon d'un ton
d'impatience; "les explications prennent tant de temps. STOP Alice commenca donc a leur conter ses aventures depuis le moment ou
elle avait vu le Lapin Blanc pour la premiere fois STOP Elle fut d'abord un
peu troublee dans le commencement; les deux creatures se tenaient si
pres d'elle, une de chaque cote, et ouvraient de si grands yeux et une
si grande bouche STOP Mais elle reprenait courage a mesure qu'elle parlait STOP Les auditeurs resterent fort tranquilles jusqu'a ce qu'elle arrivat au
moment de son histoire ou elle avait eu a repeter a la chenille: "_Vous
etes vieux, Pere Guillaume,_" et ou les mots lui etaient venus tout de
travers, et alors la Fausse-Tortue poussa un long soupir et dit: "C'est
bien singulier. STOP "Tout cela est on ne peut plus singulier," dit le Griffon STOP "Tout de travers," repeta la Fausse-Tortue d'un air reveur STOP "Je
voudrais bien l'entendre reciter quelque chose a present STOP Dites-lui de
s'y mettre. STOP Elle regardait le Griffon comme si elle lui croyait de
l'autorite sur Alice STOP [Illustration]

"Debout, et recitez: '_C'est la voix du canon,_'" dit le Griffon STOP "Comme ces etres-la vous commandent et vous font repeter des lecons! STOP pensa Alice; "autant vaudrait etre a l'ecole. STOP Cependant elle se leva
et se mit a reciter; mais elle avait la tete si pleine du Quadrille de
Homards, qu'elle savait a peine ce qu'elle disait, et que les mots lui
venaient tout drolement:--

  _"C'est la voix du homard grondant comme la foudre:
  'On m'a trop fait bouillir, il faut que je me poudre! STOP Puis, les pieds en dehors, prenant la brosse en main,
  De se faire bien beau vite il se met en train STOP "_

"C'est tout different de ce que je recitais quand j'etais petit, moi,"
dit le Griffon STOP "Je ne l'avais pas encore entendu reciter," dit la Fausse-Tortue; "mais
cela me fait l'effet d'un fameux galimatias. STOP Alice ne dit rien; elle s'etait rassise, la figure dans ses mains, se
demandant avec etonnement si jamais les choses reprendraient leur cours
naturel STOP "Je voudrais bien qu'on m'expliquat cela," dit la Fausse-Tortue STOP "Elle ne peut pas l'expliquer," dit le Griffon vivement STOP "Continuez,
recitez les vers suivants. STOP "Mais, _les pieds en dehors_," continua opiniatrement la Fausse-Tortue STOP "Pourquoi dire qu'il avait les pieds en dehors? STOP "C'est la premiere position lorsqu'on apprend a danser," dit Alice;
tout cela l'embarrassait fort, et il lui tardait de changer la
conversation STOP "Recitez les vers suivants," repeta le Griffon avec impatience; "ca
commence: '_Passant pres de chez lui----_'"

Alice n'osa pas desobeir, bien qu'elle fut sure que les mots allaient
lui venir tout de travers STOP Elle continua donc d'une voix tremblante:

  _"Passant pres de chez lui, j'ai vu, ne vous deplaise,
  Une huitre et un hibou qui dinaient fort a l'aise STOP "_

"A quoi bon repeter tout ce galimatias," interrompit la Fausse-Tortue,
"si vous ne l'expliquez pas a mesure que vous le dites STOP C'est, de
beaucoup, ce que j'ai entendu de plus embrouillant. STOP "Oui, je crois que vous feriez bien d'en rester la," dit le Griffon; et
Alice ne demanda pas mieux STOP "Essaierons-nous une autre figure du Quadrille de Homards? STOP continua
le Griffon STOP "Ou bien, preferez-vous que la Fausse-Tortue vous chante
quelque chose? STOP "Oh STOP une chanson, je vous prie; si la Fausse-Tortue veut bien avoir
cette obligeance," repondit Alice, avec tant d'empressement que le
Griffon dit d'un air un peu offense: "Hum STOP Chacun son gout STOP Chantez-lui
'_La Soupe a la Tortue,_' he STOP camarade! STOP La Fausse-Tortue poussa un profond soupir et commenca, d'une voix de
temps en temps etouffee par les sanglots:

    _"O doux potage,
  O mets delicieux STOP Ah STOP pour partage,
  Quoi de plus precieux STOP Plonger dans ma soupiere

"Bis au refrain! STOP cria le Griffon; et la Fausse-Tortue venait de le
reprendre, quand un cri, "Le proces va commencer! STOP se fit entendre au
loin STOP "Venez donc! STOP cria le Griffon; et, prenant Alice par la main, il se mit
a courir sans attendre la fin de la chanson STOP "Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce proces? STOP demanda Alice hors d'haleine; mais
le Griffon se contenta de repondre: "Venez donc! STOP en courant de plus
belle, tandis que leur parvenaient, de plus en plus faibles, apportees
par la brise qui les poursuivait, ces paroles pleines de melancolie:

    Est un bonheur
  Qui me rejouit le cur STOP "_




CHAPITRE XI STOP QUI A VOLE LES TARTES STOP LE Roi et la Reine de Cur etaient assis sur leur trone, entoures
d'une nombreuse assemblee: toutes sortes de petits oiseaux et d'autres
betes, ainsi que le paquet de cartes tout entier STOP Le Valet, charge de
chaines, garde de chaque cote par un soldat, se tenait debout devant
le trone, et pres du roi se trouvait le Lapin Blanc, tenant d'une main
une trompette et de l'autre un rouleau de parchemin STOP Au beau milieu
de la salle etait une table sur laquelle on voyait un grand plat de
tartes; ces tartes semblaient si bonnes que cela donna faim a Alice,
rien que de les regarder STOP "Je voudrais bien qu'on se depechat de finir
le proces," pensa-t-elle, "et qu'on fit passer les rafraichissements,"
mais cela ne paraissait guere probable, aussi se mit-elle a regarder
tout autour d'elle pour passer le temps STOP C'etait la premiere fois qu'Alice se trouvait dans une cour de justice,
mais elle en avait lu des descriptions dans les livres, et elle fut
toute contente de voir qu'elle savait le nom de presque tout ce qu'il
y avait la STOP "Ca, c'est le juge," se dit-elle; "je le reconnais a sa
grande perruque. STOP Le juge, disons-le en passant, etait le Roi, et, comme il portait sa
couronne par-dessus sa perruque (regardez le frontispice, si vous
voulez savoir comment il s'etait arrange) il n'avait pas du tout l'air
d'etre a son aise, et cela ne lui allait pas bien du tout STOP "Et ca, c'est le banc du jury," pensa Alice; "et ces douze creatures"
(elle etait forcee de dire 'creatures,' vous comprenez, car
quelques-uns etaient des betes et quelques autres des oiseaux), "je
suppose que ce sont les jures;" elle se repeta ce dernier mot deux ou
trois fois, car elle en etait assez fiere: pensant avec raison que bien
peu de petites filles de son age savent ce que cela veut dire STOP Les douze jures etaient tous tres-occupes a ecrire sur des ardoises STOP "Qu'est-ce qu'ils font la? STOP dit Alice a l'oreille du Griffon STOP "Ils ne
peuvent rien avoir a ecrire avant que le proces soit commence. STOP "Ils inscrivent leur nom," repondit de meme le Griffon, "de peur de
l'oublier avant la fin du proces. STOP "Les niais! STOP s'ecria Alice d'un ton indigne, mais elle se retint bien
vite, car le Lapin Blanc cria: "Silence dans l'auditoire! STOP Et le Roi,
mettant ses lunettes, regarda vivement autour de lui pour voir qui
parlait STOP Alice pouvait voir, aussi clairement que si elle eut regarde par-dessus
leurs epaules, que tous les jures etaient en train d'ecrire "les
niais" sur leurs ardoises, et elle pouvait meme distinguer que l'un
d'eux ne savait pas ecrire "niais" et qu'il etait oblige de le demander
a son voisin STOP "Leurs ardoises seront dans un bel etat avant la fin du
proces! STOP pensa Alice STOP Un des jures avait un crayon qui grincait; Alice, vous le pensez bien,
ne pouvait pas souffrir cela; elle fit le tour de la salle, arriva
derriere lui, et trouva bientot l'occasion d'enlever le crayon STOP Ce
fut si tot fait que le pauvre petit jure (c'etait Jacques, le lezard)
ne pouvait pas s'imaginer ce qu'il etait devenu STOP Apres avoir cherche
partout, il fut oblige d'ecrire avec un doigt tout le reste du jour, et
cela etait fort inutile, puisque son doigt ne laissait aucune marque
sur l'ardoise STOP "Heraut, lisez l'acte d'accusation! STOP dit le Roi STOP Sur ce, le Lapin Blanc
sonna trois fois de la trompette, et puis, deroulant le parchemin, lut
ainsi qu'il suit:

[Illustration]

  _"La Reine de Cur fit des tartes,
    Un beau jour de printemps;
  Le Valet de Cur prit les tartes,
    Et s'en fut tout content STOP "_

"Deliberez," dit le Roi aux jures STOP "Pas encore, pas encore," interrompit vivement le Lapin; "il y a bien
des choses a faire auparavant! STOP "Appelez les temoins," dit le Roi; et le Lapin Blanc sonna trois fois
de la trompette, et cria: "Le premier temoin! STOP Le premier temoin etait le Chapelier STOP Il entra, tenant d'une main
une tasse de the et de l'autre une tartine de beurre STOP "Pardon, Votre
Majeste," dit il, "si j'apporte cela ici; je n'avais pas tout a fait
fini de prendre mon the lorsqu'on est venu me chercher. STOP "Vous auriez du avoir fini," dit le Roi; "quand avez-vous commence? STOP Le Chapelier regarda le Lievre qui l'avait suivi dans la salle, bras
dessus bras dessous avec le Loir STOP "Le Quatorze Mars, je crois bien,"
dit-il STOP "Le Quinze! STOP dit le Lievre STOP "Le Seize! STOP ajouta le Loir STOP "Notez cela," dit le Roi aux jures STOP Et les jures s'empresserent
d'ecrire les trois dates sur leurs ardoises; puis en firent l'addition,
dont ils chercherent a reduire le total en francs et centimes STOP "Otez votre chapeau," dit le Roi au Chapelier STOP "Il n'est pas a moi," dit le Chapelier STOP "Vole! STOP s'ecria le Roi en se tournant du cote des jures, qui
s'empresserent de prendre note du fait STOP "Je les tiens en vente," ajouta le Chapelier, comme explication STOP "Je
n'en ai pas a moi; je suis chapelier. STOP Ici la Reine mit ses lunettes, et se prit a regarder fixement le
Chapelier, qui devint pale et tremblant STOP "Faites votre deposition," dit le Roi; "et ne soyez pas agite; sans
cela je vous fais executer sur-le-champ. STOP Cela ne parut pas du tout encourager le temoin; il ne cessait de passer
d'un pied sur l'autre en regardant la Reine d'un air inquiet, et, dans
son trouble, il mordit dans la tasse et en enleva un grand morceau, au
lieu de mordre dans la tartine de beurre STOP Juste a ce moment-la, Alice eprouva une etrange sensation qui
l'embarrassa beaucoup, jusqu'a ce qu'elle se fut rendu compte de ce
que c'etait STOP Elle recommencait a grandir, et elle pensa d'abord a se
lever et a quitter la cour: mais, toute reflexion faite, elle se decida
a rester ou elle etait, tant qu'il y aurait de la place pour elle STOP "Ne poussez donc pas comme ca," dit le Loir; "je puis a peine respirer. STOP "Ce n'est pas de ma faute," dit Alice doucement; "je grandis. STOP "Vous n'avez pas le droit de grandir ici," dit le Loir STOP "Ne dites pas de sottises," repliqua Alice plus hardiment; "vous savez
bien que vous aussi vous grandissez. STOP "Oui, mais je grandis, raisonnablement, moi," dit le Loir; "et non
de cette facon ridicule. STOP Il se leva en faisant la mine, et passa de
l'autre cote de la salle STOP Pendant tout ce temps-la, la Reine n'avait pas cesse de fixer les yeux
sur le Chapelier, et, comme le Loir traversait la salle, elle dit a un
des officiers du tribunal: "Apportez-moi la liste des chanteurs du
dernier concert. STOP Sur quoi, le malheureux Chapelier se mit a trembler
si fortement qu'il en perdit ses deux souliers STOP [Illustration]

"Faites votre deposition," repeta le Roi en colere; "ou bien je vous
fais executer, que vous soyez trouble ou non! STOP "Je suis un pauvre homme, Votre Majeste," fit le Chapelier d'une voix
tremblante; "et il n'y avait guere qu'une semaine ou deux que j'avais
commence a prendre mon the, et avec ca les tartines devenaient si
minces et les _dragees_ du the----"

"Les _dragees_ de quoi? STOP dit le Roi STOP "Ca a commence par le the," repondit le Chapelier STOP "Je vous dis que dragee commence par un _d!_" cria le Roi vivement STOP "Me
prenez-vous pour un ane STOP Continuez! STOP "Je suis un pauvre homme," continua le Chapelier; "et les dragees et
les autres choses me firent perdre la tete STOP Mais le Lievre dit----"

"C'est faux! STOP s'ecria le Lievre se depechant de l'interrompre STOP "C'est vrai! STOP cria le Chapelier STOP "Je le nie! STOP cria le Lievre STOP "Il le nie! STOP dit le Roi STOP "Passez la-dessus. STOP "Eh bien STOP dans tous les cas, le Loir dit----" continua le Chapelier,
regardant autour de lui pour voir s'il nierait aussi; mais le Loir ne
nia rien, car il dormait profondement STOP "Apres cela," continua le Chapelier, "je me coupai d'autres tartines de
beurre. STOP "Mais, que dit le Loir? STOP demanda un des jures STOP "C'est ce que je ne peux pas me rappeler," dit le Chapelier STOP "Il faut absolument que vous vous le rappeliez," fit observer le Roi;
"ou bien je vous fais executer. STOP Le malheureux Chapelier laissa tomber sa tasse et sa tartine de beurre,
et mit un genou en terre STOP "Je suis un pauvre homme, Votre Majeste! STOP commenca-t-il STOP "Vous etes un tres-pauvre orateur," dit le Roi STOP Ici un des cochons d'Inde applaudit, et fut immediatement reprime par
un des huissiers STOP (Comme ce mot est assez difficile, je vais vous
expliquer comment cela se fit STOP Ils avaient un grand sac de toile qui
se fermait a l'aide de deux ficelles attachees a l'ouverture; dans ce
sac ils firent glisser le cochon d'Inde la tete la premiere, puis ils
s'assirent dessus. STOP "Je suis contente d'avoir vu cela," pensa Alice STOP "J'ai souvent lu dans
les journaux, a la fin des proces: 'Il se fit quelques tentatives
d'applaudissements qui furent bientot reprimees par les huissiers,' et
je n'avais jamais compris jusqu'a present ce que cela voulait dire. STOP "Si c'est la tout ce que vous savez de l'affaire, vous pouvez vous
prosterner," continua le Roi STOP "Je ne puis pas me prosterner plus bas que cela," dit le Chapelier; "je
suis deja par terre. STOP "Alors asseyez-vous," repondit le Roi STOP [Illustration]

Ici l'autre cochon d'Inde applaudit et fut reprime STOP "Bon, cela met fin aux cochons d'Inde! STOP pensa Alice STOP "Maintenant ca va
mieux aller. STOP "J'aimerais bien aller finir de prendre mon the," dit le Chapelier,
en lancant un regard inquiet sur la Reine, qui lisait la liste des
chanteurs STOP "Vous pouvez vous retirer," dit le Roi; et le Chapelier se hata de
quitter la cour, sans meme prendre le temps de mettre ses souliers STOP "Et coupez-lui la tete dehors," ajouta la Reine, s'adressant a un des
huissiers; mais le Chapelier etait deja bien loin avant que l'huissier
arrivat a la porte STOP "Appelez un autre temoin," dit le Roi STOP L'autre temoin, c'etait la cuisiniere de la Duchesse; elle tenait la
poivriere a la main, et Alice devina qui c'etait, meme avant qu'elle
entrat dans la salle, en voyant eternuer, tout a coup et tous a la
fois, les gens qui se trouvaient pres de la porte STOP "Faites votre deposition," dit le Roi STOP "Non! STOP dit la cuisiniere STOP Le Roi regarda d'un air inquiet le Lapin Blanc, qui lui dit a
voix basse: "Il faut que Votre Majeste interroge ce temoin-la
contradictoirement. STOP "Puisqu'il le faut, il le faut," dit le Roi, d'un air triste; et,
apres avoir croise les bras et fronce les sourcils en regardant la
cuisiniere, au point que les yeux lui etaient presque completement
rentres dans la tete, il dit d'une voix creuse: "De quoi les tartes
sont-elles faites? STOP "De poivre principalement! STOP dit la cuisiniere STOP "De melasse," dit une voix endormie derriere elle STOP "Saisissez ce Loir au collet! STOP cria la Reine STOP "Coupez la tete a ce
Loir STOP Mettez ce Loir a la porte STOP Reprimez-le, pincez-le, arrachez-lui
ses moustaches! STOP Pendant quelques instants, toute la cour fut sens dessus dessous
pour mettre le Loir a la porte; et, quand le calme fut retabli, la
cuisiniere avait disparu STOP "Cela ne fait rien," dit le Roi, comme soulage d'un grand poids STOP "Appelez le troisieme temoin;" et il ajouta a voix basse en s'adressant a
la Reine: "Vraiment, mon amie, il faut que vous interrogiez cet autre
temoin; cela me fait trop mal au front! STOP Alice regardait le Lapin Blanc tandis qu'il tournait la liste dans
ses doigts, curieuse de savoir quel serait l'autre temoin STOP "Car les
depositions ne prouvent pas grand'chose jusqu'a present," se dit-elle STOP Imaginez sa surprise quand le Lapin Blanc cria, du plus fort de sa
petite voix criarde: "Alice! STOP CHAPITRE XII STOP DEPOSITION D'ALICE STOP "VOILA! STOP cria Alice, oubliant tout a fait dans le trouble du moment
combien elle avait grandi depuis quelques instants, et elle se leva si
brusquement qu'elle accrocha le banc des jures avec le bord de sa robe,
et le renversa, avec tous ses occupants, sur la tete de la foule qui se
trouvait au-dessous, et on les vit se debattant de tous cotes, comme
les poissons rouges du vase qu'elle se rappelait avoir renverse par
accident la semaine precedente STOP [Illustration]

"Oh STOP je vous demande bien pardon! STOP s'ecria-t-elle toute confuse,
et elle se mit a les ramasser bien vite, car l'accident arrive aux
poissons rouges lui trottait dans la tete, et elle avait une idee
vague qu'il fallait les ramasser tout de suite et les remettre sur les
bancs, sans quoi ils mourraient STOP "Le proces ne peut continuer," dit le Roi d'une voix grave, "avant que
les jures soient tous a leurs places; _tous!_" repeta-t-il avec emphase
en regardant fixement Alice STOP Alice regarda le banc des jures, et vit que dans son empressement elle
y avait place le Lezard la tete en bas, et le pauvre petit etre remuait
la queue d'une triste facon, dans l'impossibilite de se redresser; elle
l'eut bientot retourne et replace convenablement STOP "Non que cela soit
bien important," se dit-elle, "car je pense qu'il serait tout aussi
utile au proces la tete en bas qu'autrement. STOP Sitot que les jures se furent un peu remis de la secousse, qu'on eut
retrouve et qu'on leur eut rendu leurs ardoises et leurs crayons,
ils se mirent fort diligemment a ecrire l'histoire de l'accident, a
l'exception du Lezard, qui paraissait trop accable pour faire autre
chose que demeurer la bouche ouverte, les yeux fixes sur le plafond de
la salle STOP "Que savez-vous de cette affaire-la? STOP demanda le Roi a Alice STOP "Rien," repondit-elle STOP "Rien absolument? STOP insista le Roi STOP "Rien absolument," dit Alice STOP "Voila qui est tres-important," dit le Roi, se tournant vers les jures STOP Ils allaient ecrire cela sur leurs ardoises quand le Lapin Blanc
interrompant: "Peu important, veut dire Votre Majeste, sans doute,"
dit-il d'un ton tres-respectueux, mais en froncant les sourcils et en
lui faisant des grimaces STOP "Peu important, bien entendu, c'est ce que je voulais dire," repliqua
le Roi avec empressement STOP Et il continua de repeter a demi-voix:
"Tres-important, peu important, peu important, tres-important;" comme
pour essayer lequel des deux etait le mieux sonnant STOP Quelques-uns des jures ecrivirent "tres-important," d'autres, "peu
important. STOP Alice voyait tout cela, car elle etait assez pres d'eux
pour regarder sur leurs ardoises STOP "Mais cela ne fait absolument rien,"
pensa-t-elle STOP A ce moment-la, le Roi, qui pendant quelque temps avait ete fort occupe
a ecrire dans son carnet, cria: "Silence! STOP et lut sur son carnet:
"Regle Quarante-deux: _Toute personne ayant une taille de plus d'un
mille de haut devra quitter la cour._"

Tout le monde regarda Alice STOP "Je n'ai pas un mille de haut," dit-elle STOP "Si fait," dit le Roi STOP "Pres de deux milles," ajouta la Reine STOP "Eh bien STOP je ne sortirai pas quand meme; d'ailleurs cette regle n'est
pas d'usage, vous venez de l'inventer. STOP "C'est la regle la plus ancienne qu'il y ait dans le livre," dit le Roi STOP "Alors elle devrait porter le numero Un. STOP Le Roi devint pale et ferma vivement son carnet STOP "Deliberez," dit-il
aux jures d'une voix faible et tremblante STOP "Il y a d'autres depositions a recevoir, s'il plait a Votre Majeste,"
dit le Lapin, se levant precipitamment; "on vient de ramasser ce
papier. STOP "Qu'est-ce qu'il y a dedans? STOP dit la Reine STOP "Je ne l'ai pas encore ouvert," dit le Lapin Blanc; "mais on dirait que
c'est une lettre ecrite par l'accuse a---- a quelqu'un. STOP "Cela doit etre ainsi," dit le Roi, "a moins qu'elle ne soit, ecrite a
personne, ce qui n'est pas ordinaire, vous comprenez. STOP "A qui est-elle adressee? STOP dit un des jures STOP "Elle n'est pas adressee du tout," dit le Lapin Blanc; "au fait, il n'y
a rien d'ecrit a l'exterieur. STOP Il deplia le papier tout en parlant et
ajouta: "Ce n'est pas une lettre, apres tout; c'est une piece de vers. STOP "Est-ce l'ecriture de l'accuse? STOP demanda un autre jure STOP "Non," dit le Lapin Blanc, "et c'est ce qu'il y a de plus drole. STOP (Les
jures eurent tous l'air fort embarrasse. STOP "Il faut qu'il ait imite l'ecriture d'un autre," dit le Roi STOP (Les jures
reprirent l'air serein. STOP "Pardon, Votre Majeste," dit le Valet, "ce n'est pas moi qui ai ecrit
cette lettre, et on ne peut pas prouver que ce soit moi; il n'y a pas
de signature. STOP "Si vous n'avez pas signe," dit le Roi, "cela ne fait qu'empirer la
chose; il faut absolument que vous ayez eu de mauvaises intentions,
sans cela vous auriez signe, comme un honnete homme. STOP La-dessus tout le monde battit des mains; c'etait la premiere reflexion
vraiment bonne que le Roi eut faite ce jour-la STOP "Cela prouve sa culpabilite," dit la Reine STOP "Cela ne prouve rien," dit Alice STOP "Vous ne savez meme pas ce dont il
s'agit. STOP "Lisez ces vers," dit le Roi STOP Le Lapin Blanc mit ses lunettes STOP "Par ou commencerai-je, s'il plait a
Votre Majeste? STOP demanda-t-il STOP "Commencez par le commencement," dit gravement le Roi, "et continuez
jusqu'a ce que vous arriviez a la fin; la, vous vous arreterez. STOP Voici les vers que lut le Lapin Blanc:

  _"On m'a dit que tu fus chez elle
  Afin de lui pouvoir parler,
  Et qu'elle assura, la cruelle,
  Que je ne savais pas nager STOP Bientot il leur envoya dire
  (Nous savons fort bien que c'est vrai! STOP Qu'il ne faudrait pas en medire,
  Ou gare les coups de balai STOP J'en donnai trois, elle en prit une;
  Combien donc en recevrons-nous STOP (Il y a la quelque lacune. STOP Toutes revinrent d'eux a vous STOP Si vous ou moi, dans cette affaire,
  Etions par trop embarrasses,
  Prions qu'il nous laisse, confrere,
  Tous deux comme il nous a trouves STOP Vous les avez, j'en suis certaine,
  (Avant que de ses nerfs l'acces
  Ne bouleversat l'inhumaine,)
  Trompes tous trois avec succes STOP Cachez-lui qu'elle les prefere;
  Car ce doit etre, par ma foi,
  (Et sera toujours, je l'espere)
  Un secret entre vous et moi STOP "_

"Voila la piece de conviction la plus importante que nous ayons eue
jusqu'a present," dit le Roi en se frottant les mains; "ainsi, que le
jury maintenant----"

"S'il y a un seul des jures qui puisse l'expliquer," dit Alice (elle
etait devenue si grande dans ces derniers instants qu'elle n'avait plus
du tout peur de l'interrompre), "je lui donne une piece de dix sous STOP Je
ne crois pas qu'il y ait un atome de sens commun la-dedans. STOP Tous les jures ecrivirent sur leurs ardoises: "Elle ne croit pas qu'il
y ait un atome de sens commun la-dedans," mais aucun d'eux ne tenta
d'expliquer la piece de vers STOP "Si elle ne signifie rien," dit le Roi, "cela nous epargne un
monde d'ennuis, vous comprenez: car il est inutile d'en chercher
l'explication; et cependant je ne sais pas trop," continua-t-il en
etalant la piece de vers sur ses genoux et les regardant d'un il; "il
me semble que j'y vois quelque chose, apres tout STOP '_Que je ne savais
pas nager!_' Vous ne savez pas nager, n'est-ce pas? STOP ajouta-t-il en se
tournant vers le Valet STOP Le Valet secoua la tete tristement STOP "En ai-je l'air," dit-il STOP (Non,
certainement, il n'en avait pas l'air, etant fait tout entier de
carton. STOP "Jusqu'ici c'est bien," dit le Roi; et il continua de marmotter tout

cela, bien sur STOP '_J'en donnai trois, elle en prit une_;' justement,

vouloir prononcer l'arret d'abord! STOP "Taisez-vous," dit la Reine, devenant pourpre de colere STOP [Illustration]

"Je ne me tairai pas," dit Alice STOP "Qu'on lui coupe la tete! STOP hurla la Reine de toutes ses forces STOP Personne ne bougea STOP "On se moque bien de vous," dit Alice (elle avait alors atteint toute
sa grandeur naturelle) STOP "Vous n'etes qu'un paquet de cartes! STOP La-dessus tout le paquet sauta en l'air et retomba en tourbillonnant
sur elle; Alice poussa un petit cri, moitie de peur, moitie de colere,
et essaya de les repousser; elle se trouva etendue sur le gazon, la
tete sur les genoux de sa sur, qui ecartait doucement de sa figure les
feuilles mortes tombees en voltigeant du haut des arbres STOP "Reveillez-vous, chere Alice! STOP lui dit sa sur STOP "Quel long somme vous
venez de faire! STOP "Oh STOP j'ai fait un si drole de reve," dit Alice; et elle raconta a sa
sur, autant qu'elle put s'en souvenir, toutes les etranges aventures
que vous venez de lire; et, quand elle eut fini son recit, sa sur
lui dit en l'embrassant: "Certes, c'est un bien drole de reve; mais
maintenant courez a la maison prendre le the; il se fait tard. STOP Alice
se leva donc et s'eloigna en courant, pensant le long du chemin, et
avec raison, quel reve merveilleux elle venait de faire STOP Mais sa sur demeura assise tranquillement, tout comme elle l'avait
laissee, la tete appuyee sur la main, contemplant le coucher du soleil
et pensant a la petite Alice et a ses merveilleuses aventures; si bien
qu'elle aussi se mit a rever, en quelque sorte; et voici son reve:--

D'abord elle reva de la petite Alice personnellement:--les petites
mains de l'enfant etaient encore jointes sur ses genoux, et ses
yeux vifs et brillants plongeaient leur regard dans les siens STOP Elle
entendait jusqu'au son de sa voix; elle voyait ce singulier petit
mouvement de tete par lequel elle rejetait en arriere les cheveux
vagabonds qui sans cesse lui revenaient dans les yeux; et, comme elle
ecoutait ou paraissait ecouter, tout s'anima autour d'elle et se peupla
des etranges creatures du reve de sa jeune sur STOP Les longues herbes
bruissaient a ses pieds sous les pas precipites du Lapin Blanc; la
Souris effrayee faisait clapoter l'eau en traversant la mare voisine;
elle entendait le bruit des tasses, tandis que le Lievre et ses amis
prenaient leur repas qui ne finissait jamais, et la voix percante de
la Reine envoyant a la mort ses malheureux invites STOP Une fois encore
l'enfant-porc eternuait sur les genoux de la Duchesse, tandis que les
assiettes et les plats se brisaient autour de lui; une fois encore la
voix criarde du Griffon, le grincement du crayon d'ardoise du Lezard,
et les cris etouffes des cochons d'Inde mis dans le sac par ordre de la
cour, remplissaient les airs, en se melant aux sanglots que poussait au
loin la malheureuse Fausse-Tortue STOP C'est ainsi qu'elle demeura assise, les yeux fermes, et se croyant
presque dans le Pays des Merveilles, bien qu'elle sut qu'elle n'avait
qu'a rouvrir les yeux pour que tout fut change en une triste realite:
les herbes ne bruiraient plus alors que sous le souffle du vent, et
l'eau de la mare ne murmurerait plus qu'au balancement des roseaux; le
bruit des tasses deviendrait le tintement des clochettes au cou des
moutons, et elle reconnaitrait les cris aigus de la Reine dans la voix
percante du petit berger; l'eternuement du bebe, le cri du Griffon et
tous les autres bruits etranges ne seraient plus, elle le savait bien,
que les clameurs confuses d'une cour de ferme, tandis que le beuglement
des bestiaux dans le lointain remplacerait les lourds sanglots de la
Fausse-Tortue STOP Enfin elle se representa cette meme petite sur, dans l'avenir, devenue
elle aussi une grande personne; elle se la representa conservant,
jusque dans l'age mur, le cur simple et aimant de son enfance, et
reunissant autour d'elle d'autres petits enfants dont elle ferait
briller les yeux vifs et curieux au recit de bien des aventures
etranges, et peut-etre meme en leur contant le songe du Pays des
Merveilles du temps jadis: elle la voyait partager leurs petits
chagrins et trouver plaisir a leurs innocentes joies, se rappelant sa
propre enfance et les heureux jours d'ete STOP FIN STOP LONDRES.--IMPRIMERIE DE R. CLAY, FILS, ET TAYLOR, BREAD STREET HILL STOP Liste des modifications:

Sec STOP 1 STOP _On Stamp-Cases._


Some American writer has said "the snakes in this district may be divided
into one species--the venomous. STOP The same principle applies here STOP Postage-Stamp-Cases may be divided into one species, the "Wonderland. STOP Imitations of it will soon appear, no doubt: but they cannot include the
two Pictorial Surprises, which are copyright STOP You don't see why I call them 'Surprises' STOP Well, take the Case in your
left-hand, and regard it attentively STOP You see Alice nursing the Duchess's
Baby STOP (An entirely new combination, by the way: it doesn't occur in the
book. STOP Now, with your right thumb and forefinger, lay hold of the little
book, and suddenly pull it out STOP _The Baby has turned into a Pig!_ If
_that_ doesn't surprise you, why, I suppose you wouldn't be surprised if
your own Mother-in-law suddenly turned into a Gyroscope STOP This Case is _not_ intended to carry about in your pocket STOP Far from it STOP People seldom want any other Stamps, on an emergency, than Penny-Stamps
for Letters, Sixpenny-Stamps for Telegrams, and a bit of Stamp-edging for
cut fingers (it makes capital sticking-plaster, and will stand three or
four washings, cautiously conducted): and all these are easily carried in
a purse or pocketbook STOP No, _this_ is meant to haunt your envelope-case, or
wherever you keep your writing-materials STOP What made me invent it was the
constantly wanting Stamps of other values, for foreign Letters, Parcel
Post, &c., and finding it very bothersome to get at the kind I wanted in
a hurry STOP Since I have possessed a "Wonderland Stamp Case", Life has been
bright and peaceful, and I have used no other STOP I believe the Queen's
laundress uses no other STOP Each of the pockets will hold 6 stamps, comfortably STOP I would recommend you
to arrange the 6, before putting them in, something like a _bouquet_,
making them lean to the right and to the left alternately: thus there will
always be a free _corner_ to get hold of, so as to take them out, quickly
and easily, one by one: otherwise you will find them apt to come out two
or three at a time STOP According to _my_ experience, the 5_d._, 9_d._, and 1_s._ Stamps are
hardly ever wanted, though I have constantly to replenish all the other
pockets STOP If your experience agrees with mine, you may find it convenient
to keep only a couple (say) of each of these 3 kinds, in the 1_s._
pocket, and to fill the other 2 pockets with extra 1_d._ stamps STOP Sec STOP 2 STOP _How to begin a Letter._


If the Letter is to be in answer to another, begin by getting out that
other letter and reading it through, in order to refresh your memory, as
to what it is you have to answer, and as to your correspondent's _present
address_ (otherwise you will be sending your letter to his regular address
in _London_, though he has been careful in writing to give you his
_Torquay_ address in full) STOP Next, Address and Stamp the Envelope STOP "What STOP Before writing the _Letter_? STOP Most certainly STOP And I'll tell you what will happen if you don't STOP You will
go on writing till the last moment, and just in the middle of the last
sentence, you will become aware that 'time's up! STOP Then comes the hurried
wind-up--the wildly-scrawled signature--the hastily-fastened envelope,
which comes open in the post--the address, a mere hieroglyphic--the
horrible discovery that you've forgotten to replenish your Stamp-Case--the
frantic appeal, to every one in the house, to lend you a Stamp--the
headlong rush to the Post Office, arriving, hot and gasping, just after
the box has closed--and finally, a week afterwards, the return of the
Letter, from the Dead-Letter Office, marked "address illegible" STOP Next, put your own address, _in full_, at the top of the note-sheet STOP It is
an aggravating thing----I speak from bitter experience----when a friend,
staying at some new address, heads his letter "Dover," simply, assuming
that you can get the rest of the address from his previous letter, which
perhaps you have destroyed STOP Next, put the date _in full_ STOP It is another aggravating thing, when you
wish, years afterwards, to arrange a series of letters, to find them dated
"Feb. 17", "Aug. 2", without any year to guide you as to which comes
first STOP And never, never, dear Madam (N.B STOP this remark is addressed to
ladies _only_: no _man_ would ever do such a thing), put "Wednesday",
simply, as the date STOP "_That way madness lies._"




Sec STOP 3 STOP _How to go on with a Letter._


Here is a golden Rule to begin with STOP _Write legibly._ The average temper
of the human race would be perceptibly sweetened, if everybody obeyed this
Rule STOP A great deal of the bad writing in the world comes simply from
writing _too quickly_ STOP Of course you reply, "I do it to save _time_" STOP A
very good object, no doubt: but what right have you to do it at your
friend's expense STOP Isn't _his_ time as valuable as yours STOP Years ago, I used
to receive letters from a friend----and very interesting letters
too----written in one of the most atrocious hands ever invented STOP It
generally took me about a _week_ to read one of his letters STOP I used to
carry it about in my pocket, and take it out at leisure times, to puzzle
over the riddles which composed it----holding it in different positions,
and at different distances, till at last the meaning of some hopeless
scrawl would flash upon me, when I at once wrote down the English under
it; and, when several had been thus guessed, the context would help one
with the others, till at last the whole series of hieroglyphics was
deciphered STOP If _all_ one's friends wrote like that, Life would be entirely
spent in reading their letters STOP This Rule applies, specially, to names of people or places----and _most_
specially to _foreign names_ STOP I got a letter once, containing some Russian
names, written in the same hasty scramble in which people often write
"yours sincerely" STOP The _context_, of course, didn't help in the least: and
one spelling was just as likely as another, so far as _I_ knew: it was
necessary to write and tell my friend that I couldn't read any of them STOP My second Rule is, don't fill _more_ than a page and a half with apologies
for not having written sooner STOP The best subject, to _begin_ with, is your friend's last letter STOP Write
with the letter open before you STOP Answer his questions, and make any
remarks his letter suggests STOP _Then_ go on to what you want to say
yourself STOP This arrangement is more courteous, and pleasanter for the
reader, than to fill the letter with your own invaluable remarks, and then
hastily answer your friend's questions in a postscript STOP Your friend is
much more likely to enjoy your wit, _after_ his own anxiety for
information has been satisfied STOP In referring to anything your friend has said in his letter, it is best to
_quote the exact words_, and not to give a summary of them in _your_
words STOP _A's_ impression, of what _B_ has said, expressed in _A's_ words,
will never convey to _B_ the meaning of his own words STOP This is specially necessary when some point has arisen as to which the two
correspondents do not quite agree STOP There ought to be no opening for such
writing as "You are quite mistaken in thinking I said so-and-so STOP It was
not in the least my meaning, &c., &c.", which tends to make a
correspondence last for a lifetime STOP A few more Rules may fitly be given here, for correspondence that has
unfortunately become _controversial_ STOP One is, _don't repeat yourself_ STOP When once you have said your say, fully
and clearly, on a certain point, and have failed to convince your friend,
_drop that subject_: to repeat your arguments, all over again, will simply
lead to his doing the same; and so you will go on, like a Circulating
Decimal STOP _Did you ever know a Circulating Decimal come to an end?_

Another Rule is, when you have written a letter that you feel may possibly
irritate your friend, however necessary you may have felt it to so express
yourself, _put it aside till the next day_ STOP Then read it over again, and
fancy it addressed to yourself STOP This will often lead to your writing it
all over again, taking out a lot of the vinegar and pepper, and putting in
honey instead, and thus making a _much_ more palatable dish of it STOP If,
when you have done your best to write inoffensively, you still feel that
it will probably lead to further controversy, _keep a copy of it_ STOP There
is very little use, months afterwards, in pleading "I am almost sure I
never expressed myself as you say: to the best of my recollection I said
so-and-so" STOP _Far_ better to be able to write "I did _not_ express myself
so: these are the words I used. STOP My fifth Rule is, if your friend makes a severe remark, either leave it
unnoticed, or make your reply distinctly _less_ severe: and if he makes a
friendly remark, tending towards 'making up' the little difference that
has arisen between you, let your reply be distinctly _more_ friendly STOP If,
in picking a quarrel, each party declined to go more than _three-eighths_
of the way, and if, in making friends, each was ready to go _five-eighths_
of the way--why, there would be more reconciliations than quarrels STOP Which
is like the Irishman's remonstrance to his gad-about daughter--"Shure,
you're _always_ goin' out STOP You go out _three_ times, for _wanst_ that you
come in! STOP My sixth Rule (and my last remark about controversial correspondence) is,
_don't try to have the last word_ STOP How many a controversy would be nipped
in the bud, if each was anxious to let the _other_ have the last word STOP Never mind how telling a rejoinder you leave unuttered: never mind your
friend's supposing that you are silent from lack of anything to say: let
the thing drop, as soon as it is possible without discourtesy: remember
'speech is silvern, but silence is golden' STOP (N.B.--If you are a gentleman,
and your friend a lady, this Rule is superfluous: _you won't get the last
word_! STOP My seventh Rule is, if it should ever occur to you to write, jestingly, in
_dispraise_ of your friend, be sure you exaggerate enough to make the
jesting _obvious_: a word spoken in _jest_, but taken as _earnest_, may
lead to very serious consequences STOP I have known it to lead to the
breaking-off of a friendship STOP Suppose, for instance, you wish to remind
your friend of a sovereign you have lent him, which he has forgotten to
repay--you might quite _mean_ the words "I mention it, as you seem to have
a conveniently bad memory for debts", in jest: yet there would be nothing
to wonder at if he took offence at that way of putting it STOP But, suppose
you wrote "Long observation of your career, as a pickpocket and a burglar,
has convinced me that my one lingering hope, for recovering that sovereign
I lent you, is to say 'Pay up, or I'll summons yer!' STOP he would indeed be a
matter-of-fact friend if he took _that_ as seriously meant STOP My eighth Rule STOP When you say, in your letter, "I enclose cheque for L5",
or "I enclose John's letter for you to see", leave off writing for a
moment--go and get the document referred to--and _put it into the
envelope_ STOP Otherwise, you are pretty certain to find it lying about,
_after the Post has gone_ STOP My ninth Rule STOP When you get to the end of a note-sheet, and find you have
more to say, take another piece of paper--a whole sheet, or a scrap, as
the case may demand: but, whatever you do, _don't cross_ STOP Remember the old
proverb '_Cross-writing makes cross reading_' STOP "The _old_ proverb? STOP you
say, enquiringly STOP "_How_ old? STOP Well, not so _very_ ancient, I must
confess STOP In fact, I'm afraid I invented it while writing this paragraph STOP Still, you know, 'old' is a _comparative_ term STOP I think you would be
_quite_ justified in addressing a chicken, just out of the shell, as "Old
boy STOP ", _when compared_ with another chicken, that was only half-out STOP Sec STOP 4 STOP _How to end a Letter._


If doubtful whether to end with 'yours faithfully', or 'yours truly', or
'yours most truly', &c. (there are at least a dozen varieties, before you
reach 'yours affectionately'), refer to your correspondent's last letter,
and make your winding-up _at least as friendly as his_; in fact, even if a
shade _more_ friendly, it will do no harm STOP A Postscript is a very useful invention: but it is _not_ meant (as so many
ladies suppose) to contain the real _gist_ of the letter: it serves rather
to throw into the shade any little matter we do _not_ wish to make a fuss
about STOP For example, your friend had promised to execute a commission for
you in town, but forgot it, thereby putting you to great inconvenience:
and he now writes to apologize for his negligence STOP It would be cruel, and
needlessly crushing, to make it the main subject of your reply STOP How much
more gracefully it comes in thus STOP "P.S STOP Don't distress yourself any more
about having omitted that little matter in town STOP I won't deny that it
_did_ put my plans out a little, at the time: but it's all right now STOP I
often forget things, myself: and 'those who live in glass-houses, mustn't
throw stones', you know! STOP When you take your letters to the Post, _carry them in your hand_ STOP If you
put them in your pocket you will take a long country-walk (I speak from
experience), passing the Post-Office _twice_, going and returning, and,
when you get home, will find them _still_ in your pocket STOP Sec STOP 5 STOP _On registering Correspondence._


Let me recommend you to keep a record of Letters Received and Sent STOP I have
kept one for many years, and have found it of the greatest possible
service, in many ways: it secures my _answering_ Letters, however long
they have to wait; it enables me to refer, for my own guidance, to the
details of previous correspondence, though the actual Letters may have
been destroyed long ago; and, most valuable feature of all, if any
difficulty arises, years afterwards, in connection with a half-forgotten
correspondence, it enables me to say, with confidence, "I did _not_ tell
you that he was 'an _invaluable_ servant in _every_ way', and that you
_couldn't_ 'trust him too much' STOP I have a _precis_ of my letter STOP What I
said was 'he is a _valuable_ servant in _many_ ways, but _don't_ trust him
too much' STOP So, if he's cheated you, you really must not hold _me_
responsible for it! STOP I will now give you a few simple Rules for making, and keeping, a
Letter-Register STOP Get a blank book, containing (say) 200 leaves, about 4 inches wide and 7
high STOP It should be _well_ fastened into its cover, as it will have to be
opened and shut hundreds of times STOP Have a line ruled, in red ink, down
each margin of every page, an inch off the edge (the margin should be wide
enough to contain a number of 5 digits, easily: _I_ manage with a 3/4 inch
margin: but, unless you write very small you will find an inch more
comfortable) STOP Write a _precis_ of each Letter, received or sent, in chronological
order STOP Let the entry of a 'received' Letter reach from the left-hand edge
to the right-hand marginal line; and the entry of a 'sent' Letter from the
left-hand marginal line to the right-hand edge STOP Thus the two kinds will be
quite distinct, and you can easily hunt through the 'received' Letters by
themselves, without being bothered with the 'sent' Letters; and _vice
versa_ STOP Use the _right-hand_ pages only: and, when you come to the end of the
book, turn it upside-down, and begin at the other end, still using
right-hand pages STOP You will find this much more comfortable than using
left-hand pages STOP You will find it convenient to write, at the top of every sheet of a
'received' Letter, its Register-Number in full STOP I will now give a few (ideal) specimen pages of my Letter-Register, and
make a few remarks on them: after which I think you will find it easy
enough to manage one for yourself STOP 29217|              /90 STOP ||

I begin each page by putting, at the top left-hand corner, the next
entry-number I am going to use, _in full_ (the last 3 digits of each
entry-number are enough afterwards); and I put the date of the year, at
the top, in the centre STOP I begin each entry with the last 3 digits of the entry-number, enclosed in
an oval (this is difficult to reproduce in print, so I have put
round-parentheses here) STOP Then, for the _first_ entry in each page, I put
the day of the month and the day of the week: afterwards, 'do. STOP is enough
for the month-day, till it changes: I do not repeat the week-day STOP Next, if the entry is _not_ a letter, I put a symbol for 'parcel' (see
Nos STOP 243, 245) or 'telegram' (see Nos STOP 230, 231) as the case may be STOP Next, the name of the person, underlined (indicated here by italics) STOP If an entry needs special further attention, I put [____ at the end: and,
when it has been attended to, I fill in the appropriate symbol, e.g STOP in
No STOP 218, it showed that the bill had to be _paid_; in No STOP 222, that an
answer was really _needed_ (the 'x' means 'attended to'); in No STOP 234, that
I owed the old lady a visit; in No STOP 235, that the item had to be entered
in my account book; in No STOP 236, that I must not forget to write; in No STOP 239, that the address had to be entered in my address-book; in No STOP 245,
that the book had to be returned STOP I give each entry the space of 2 lines, whether it fills them or not, in
order to have room for references STOP And, at the foot of each page I leave 2
or 3 lines _blank_ (often useful afterwards for entering omitted Letters)
and miss one or 2 numbers before I begin the next page STOP At any odd moments of leisure, I 'make up' the entry-book, in various
ways, as follows:--

(1) I draw a _second_ line, at the right-hand end of the 'received'
entries, and at the left-hand end of the 'sent' entries STOP This I usually do
pretty well 'up to date' STOP In my Register the first line is _red_, the
second _blue_: here I distinguish them by making the first thin, and the
second _thick_ STOP (2) Beginning with the last entry, and going backwards, I read over the
names till I recognise one as having occurred already: I then link the two
entries together, by giving the one, that comes first in chronological
order, a 'foot-reference' (see Nos STOP 217, 225) STOP I do not keep this
'up-to-date', but leave it till there are 4 or 5 pages to be done STOP I work
back till I come among entries that are all supplied with
'foot-references', when I once more glance through the last few pages, to
see if there are any entries not yet supplied with head-references:
_their_ predecessors may need a special search STOP If an entry is connected,
in subject, with another under a different name, I link them by
cross-references, distinguished from the head- and foot-references by
being written _further from the marginal line_ (see No STOP 229) STOP When 2
consecutive entries have the same name, and are both of the same kind
(i.e STOP both 'received' or both 'sent') I bracket them (see Nos STOP 242, 243);
if of different kinds, I link them with the symbol used for Nos STOP 219, 220 STOP (3) Beginning at the earliest entry not yet done with, and going forwards,
I cross out every entry that has got a head- and foot-reference, and is
done with, by continuing the extra line _through_ it (see Nos STOP 221, 223,
225) STOP Thus, wherever a _break_ occurs in this extra line, it shows there
is some matter still needing attention STOP I do not keep this anything like
'up to date', but leave it till there are 30 or 40 pages to look through
at a time STOP When the first page in the volume is thus completely crossed
out, I put a mark at the foot of the page to indicate this; and so with
pages 2, 3, &c. Hence, whenever I do this part of the 'making up', I need
not begin at the beginning of the volume, but only at the _earliest page
that has not got this mark_ STOP All this looks very complicated, when stated at full length: but you will
find it perfectly simple, when you have had a little practice, and will
come to regard the 'making-up' as a pleasant occupation for a rainy day,
or at any time that you feel disinclined for more severe mental work STOP In
the Game of Whist, Hoyle gives us one golden Rule, "When in doubt, win the
trick"--I find that Rule admirable for real life: when in doubt what to
do, I 'make-up' my Letter-Register STOP THE END STOP Works by Lewis Carroll STOP PUBLISHED BY

NOTE


_The history of this little sparkle from the pen of Lewis Carroll may soon
be told STOP It was in October of the year 1884 that he came on a visit to a
certain vicarage in Derbyshire, where he had promised, on the score of
friendship, to do what was for him a most unusual favour--to give a
lecture before a public audience._

_The writer well remembers his nervous, highly-strung manner as he stood
before the little room full of simple people, few of whom had any idea of
the world-wide reputation of that shy, slight figure before them._

_When the lecture was over, he handed the manuscript to me, saying: 'Do
what you like with it STOP '_

_The one for whose sake he did this kindness was not long after called_

  'Into the Silent Land. STOP _So the beautifully-written MS., in his customary violet ink, has been
treasured for more than twenty years, only now and then being read over at
Christmastime to a friend or two by the study fire, always to meet with
the same welcome and glad acknowledgment that here was a genuine, though
little flame that could not have belonged to any other source but that
which all the world knew in_ Alice in Wonderland _and_ Through the
Looking-Glass STOP _There may be, perhaps, many others who, gathering round a winter fire,
will be glad to read words, however few, from that bright source, and
whose memories will respond to the fresh touch of that cherished name._

_It remains to add but one or two more associations that cling to it and
make the remembrance more vivid still STOP While Lewis Carroll was staying in
the house, there came to call a certain genial and by no means shy Dean,
who, without realizing what he was doing, proceeded, in the presence of
other callers, to make some remark identifying Mr. Dodgson as the author
of his books._

_There followed an immense explosion immediately on the visitor's
departure, with a pathetic and serious request that, if there were any
risk of a repetition of the call, due warning might be given, and the
retreat secured._

_Probably not many readers of the immortal Alice have ever seen the
curious little whimsical paper called_

  EIGHT OR NINE WISE WORDS ABOUT LETTER-WRITING

_which their author had printed and used to send to his acquaintance,
accompanied by a small case for postage-stamps._

_It consists of forty pages, and is published by Emberlin and Son, Oxford;
and these are the contents:_

                                    PAGE
  ON STAMP-CASES,                      5
  HOW TO BEGIN A LETTER,               8
  HOW TO GO ON WITH A LETTER,         11
  HOW TO END A LETTER,                20
  ON REGISTERING CORRESPONDENCE,      22

_In this little script, also, there are the same sparkles of wit which
betoken that nimble pen, as, for example, under_ 'How to begin a Letter':

'"And never, never, dear madam" (N.B.--This remark is addressed to ladies
_only_ STOP No _man_ would ever do such a thing), "put 'Wednesday' simply as
the date STOP "_That way madness lies!_"'

_From section 3_: 'How to go on with a Letter. STOP --'A great deal of the bad
writing in the world comes simply from writing too _quickly_ STOP Of course
you reply, "I do it to save _time_. STOP A very good object, no doubt, but
what right have you to do it at your friend's expense STOP Isn't _his_ time as
valuable as yours STOP Years ago I used to receive letters from a friend--and
very interesting letters too--written in one of the most atrocious hands
ever invented STOP It generally took me about a _week_ to read one of his
letters STOP I used to carry it about in my pocket and take it out at leisure
times, to puzzle over the riddles which composed it--holding it in
different positions and at different distances, till at last the meaning
of some hopeless scrawl would flash upon me, when I at once wrote down the
English under it STOP And when several had been thus guessed the context would
help one with the others, till at last the whole series of hieroglyphics
was deciphered STOP If _all_ one's friends wrote like that, life would be
entirely spent in reading their letters! STOP _Rule for correspondence that has, unfortunately, become_ controversial STOP '_Don't repeat yourself._--When once you have had your say fully and
clearly on a certain point, and have failed to convince your friend,
_drop that subject_ STOP To repeat your arguments all over again, will simply
lead to his doing the same, and so you will go on like a circulating
decimal STOP _Did you ever know a circulating decimal come to an end?_'

                                   

_Rule 5._--'If your friend makes a severe remark, either leave it
unnoticed, or make your reply distinctly less severe; and if he makes a
friendly remark, tending towards making up the little difference that has
arisen between you, let your reply be distinctly _more_ friendly STOP 'If, in picking a quarrel, each party declined to go more than
_three-eighths_ of the way, and if in making friends, each was ready to go
_five-eighths_ of the way--why, there would be more reconciliations than
quarrels STOP Which is like the Irishman's remonstrance to his gad-about
daughter: "Shure, you're _always_ goin' out STOP You go out three times for
_wanst_ that you come in!" STOP _Rule 6._--'Don't try to get the last word... STOP (N.B.--If you are a
gentleman and your friend a lady, this rule is superfluous: _You won't get
the last word!_)'

                                   

_Let the last word to-day be part of another rule, which gives a glimpse
into that gentle heart:_

'When you have written a letter that you feel may possibly irritate your
friend, however necessary you may have felt it to so express yourself,
_put it aside till the next day_ STOP Then read it over again, and fancy it
addressed to yourself STOP This will often lead to your writing it all over
again, taking out a lot of the vinegar and pepper and putting in honey
instead, and thus making a _much_ more palatable dish of it! STOP 'Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus
  Tam cari capitis? STOP W. H. D.

_November 1907._




FEEDING THE MIND


Breakfast, dinner, tea; in extreme cases, breakfast, luncheon, dinner,
tea, supper, and a glass of something hot at bedtime STOP What care we take
about feeding the lucky body STOP Which of us does as much for his mind STOP And
what causes the difference STOP Is the body so much the more important of the
two STOP By no means: but life depends on the body being fed, whereas we can
continue to exist as animals (scarcely as men) though the mind be
utterly starved and neglected STOP Therefore Nature provides that, in case of
serious neglect of the body, such terrible consequences of discomfort and
pain shall ensue, as will soon bring us back to a sense of our duty: and
some of the functions necessary to life she does for us altogether,
leaving us no choice in the matter STOP It would fare but ill with many of us
if we were left to superintend our own digestion and circulation STOP 'Bless
me! STOP one would cry, 'I forgot to wind up my heart this morning STOP To think
that it has been standing still for the last three hours! STOP 'I can't walk
with you this afternoon,' a friend would say, 'as I have no less than
eleven dinners to digest STOP I had to let them stand over from last week,
being so busy, and my doctor says he will not answer for the consequences
if I wait any longer! STOP Well, it is, I say, for us that the consequences of neglecting the body
can be clearly seen and felt; and it might be well for some if the mind
were equally visible and tangible--if we could take it, say, to the
doctor, and have its pulse felt STOP 'Why, what have you been doing with this mind lately STOP How have you fed it STOP It looks pale, and the pulse is very slow. STOP 'Well, doctor, it has not had much regular food lately STOP I gave it a lot of
sugar-plums yesterday. STOP 'Sugar-plums STOP What kind? STOP 'Well, they were a parcel of conundrums, sir. STOP 'Ah, I thought so STOP Now just mind this: if you go on playing tricks like
that, you'll spoil all its teeth, and get laid up with mental indigestion STOP You must have nothing but the plainest reading for the next few days STOP Take
care now STOP No novels on any account! STOP Considering the amount of painful experience many of us have had in
feeding and dosing the body, it would, I think, be quite worth our while
to try and translate some of the rules into corresponding ones for the
mind STOP First, then, we should set ourselves to provide for our mind its _proper
kind_ of food STOP We very soon learn what will, and what will not, agree with
the body, and find little difficulty in refusing a piece of the tempting
pudding or pie which is associated in our memory with that terrible attack
of indigestion, and whose very name irresistibly recalls rhubarb and
magnesia; but it takes a great many lessons to convince us how
indigestible some of our favourite lines of reading are, and again and
again we make a meal of the unwholesome novel, sure to be followed by its
usual train of low spirits, unwillingness to work, weariness of
existence--in fact, by mental nightmare STOP Then we should be careful to provide this wholesome food in _proper
amount_ STOP Mental gluttony, or over-reading, is a dangerous propensity,
tending to weakness of digestive power, and in some cases to loss of
appetite: we know that bread is a good and wholesome food, but who would
like to try the experiment of eating two or three loaves at a sitting STOP I have heard a physician telling his patient--whose complaint was merely
gluttony and want of exercise--that 'the earliest symptom of
hyper-nutrition is a deposition of adipose tissue,' and no doubt the fine
long words greatly consoled the poor man under his increasing load of
fat STOP I wonder if there is such a thing in nature as a FAT MIND STOP I really think
I have met with one or two: minds which could not keep up with the slowest
trot in conversation; could not jump over a logical fence, to save their
lives; always got stuck fast in a narrow argument; and, in short, were fit
for nothing but to waddle helplessly through the world STOP Then, again, though the food be wholesome and in proper amount, we know
that we must not consume _too many kinds at once_ STOP Take the thirsty a
quart of beer, or a quart of cider, or even a quart of cold tea, and he
will probably thank you (though not so heartily in the last case!) STOP But
what think you his feelings would be if you offered him a tray containing
a little mug of beer, a little mug of cider, another of cold tea, one of
hot tea, one of coffee, one of cocoa, and corresponding vessels of milk,
water, brandy-and-water, and butter-milk STOP The sum total might be a quart,
but would it be the same thing to the haymaker STOP Having settled the proper kind, amount, and variety of our mental food, it
remains that we should be careful to allow _proper intervals_ between meal
and meal, and not swallow the food hastily without mastication, so that it
may be thoroughly digested; both which rules, for the body, are also
applicable at once to the mind STOP First, as to the intervals: these are as really necessary as they are for
the body, with this difference only, that while the body requires three or
four hours' rest before it is ready for another meal, the mind will in
many cases do with three or four minutes STOP I believe that the interval
required is much shorter than is generally supposed, and from personal
experience, I would recommend anyone, who has to devote several hours
together to one subject of thought, to try the effect of such a break, say
once an hour, leaving off for five minutes only each time, but taking care
to throw the mind absolutely 'out of gear' for those five minutes, and
to turn it entirely to other subjects STOP It is astonishing what an amount of
impetus and elasticity the mind recovers during those short periods of
rest STOP And then, as to the mastication of the food, the mental process answering
to this is simply _thinking over_ what we read STOP This is a very much
greater exertion of mind than the mere passive taking in the contents of
our Author STOP So much greater an exertion is it, that, as Coleridge says,
the mind often 'angrily refuses' to put itself to such trouble--so much
greater, that we are far too apt to neglect it altogether, and go on
pouring in fresh food on the top of the undigested masses already lying
there, till the unfortunate mind is fairly swamped under the flood STOP But
the greater the exertion the more valuable, we may be sure, is the effect STOP One hour of steady thinking over a subject (a solitary walk is as good an
opportunity for the process as any other) is worth two or three of reading
only STOP And just consider another effect of this thorough digestion of the
books we read; I mean the arranging and 'ticketing,' so to speak, of the
subjects in our minds, so that we can readily refer to them when we want
them STOP Sam Slick tells us that he has learnt several languages in his life,
but somehow 'couldn't keep the parcels sorted' in his mind STOP And many a
mind that hurries through book after book, without waiting to digest or
arrange anything, gets into that sort of condition, and the unfortunate
owner finds himself far from fit really to support the character all his
friends give him STOP 'A thoroughly well-read man STOP Just you try him in any subject, now STOP You
can't puzzle him. STOP You turn to the thoroughly well-read man STOP You ask him a question, say, in
English history (he is understood to have just finished reading Macaulay) STOP He smiles good-naturedly, tries to look as if he knew all about it, and
proceeds to dive into his mind for the answer STOP Up comes a handful of very
promising facts, but on examination they turn out to belong to the wrong
century, and are pitched in again STOP A second haul brings up a fact much
more like the real thing, but, unfortunately, along with it comes a tangle
of other things--a fact in political economy, a rule in arithmetic, the
ages of his brother's children, and a stanza of Gray's 'Elegy,' and among
all these, the fact he wants has got hopelessly twisted up and entangled STOP Meanwhile, every one is waiting for his reply, and, as the silence is
getting more and more awkward, our well-read friend has to stammer out
some half-answer at last, not nearly so clear or so satisfactory as an

Breakfast Table,' gives the following rule for knowing whether a human
being is young or old: 'The crucial experiment is this--offer a bulky bun
to the suspected individual just ten minutes before dinner STOP If this is
easily accepted and devoured, the fact of youth is established. STOP He tells
us that a human being, 'if young, will eat anything at any hour of the day
or night. STOP To ascertain the healthiness of the _mental_ appetite of a human animal,
place in its hands a short, well-written, but not exciting treatise on
some popular subject--a mental _bun_, in fact STOP If it is read with eager
interest and perfect attention, _and if the reader can answer questions on
the subject afterwards_, the mind is in first-rate working order STOP If it be
politely laid down again, or perhaps lounged over for a few minutes, and
then, 'I can't read this stupid book STOP Would you hand me the second volume
of "The Mysterious Murder"? STOP you may be equally sure that there is
something wrong in the mental digestion STOP If this paper has given you any useful hints on the important subject of
reading, and made you see that it is one's duty no less than one's
interest to 'read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest' the good books that
fall in your way, its purpose will be fulfilled STOP BILLING AND SONS, LTD., PRINTERS, GUILDFORD

tre enuigxis pro senokupo STOP Unu, du foje sxi prove rigardis en la
libron kiun la fratino legas, sed povis vidi en gxi nek desegnojn nek
konversaciojn, kaj "por kio utilas libro," pensis sxi, "enhavanta nek
desegnojn nek konversaciojn? STOP Sxi do ekpripensis--ne tre vigle cxar
la tago estis varma, kaj sxi sentis sin tre dormema--cxu la plezuro
fari cxenon el lekantetoj valorus la laboron sin levi kaj kolekti
lekantetojn, kiam tutapude preterkuris Blanka kuniklo kun palerugxaj
okuloj STOP Tio ja ne estis _tre_ mirinda, ankaux ne sxajnis al Alicio _tre_
eksterordinare auxdi la kuniklon diranta al si:--

"Ho, ve STOP mi malfruos! STOP (Kiam poste sxi pripensadis la aferon, sxajnis al sxi, ke tio estis
efektive mirinda, sed en la momento mem, gxi sxajnis al sxi tute
ordinara. STOP Tamen, kiam la kuniklo el sia vesxta posxo eligis posxhorlogxon, kaj,
rigardinte gxin, tuj plirapidis, Alicio eksaltis sur la piedojn, cxar
subite frapis sxin la ideo, ke neniam antauxe sxi vidis kuniklon kiu
havas vesxtposxon kaj posxhorlogxon STOP La scivolemo en sxi ekflamigxis STOP Tuj sxi ekkuris post gxi trans la kampon, kaj alvenis al tuneleto sub
la kreskajxa barilo gxustatempe por vidi la kuniklon malaperi en gxin STOP Ne konsiderinte ecx unu momenton, kiamaniere sxi reeligxos, Alicio
postkuris gxin en la tuneleton STOP La tunelo, cxe la unuaj pasxoj, kondukis rekte antauxen, same kiel
fervoja tunelo, sed poste deklinigxis malsupren kaj farigxis kruta STOP Tio okazis tiel subite ke Alicio, ne havinte tempon por malakceligxi,
trovis sin vole nevole defalanta tre profundan sxakton STOP Mi jxus diris "tre profundan. STOP Nu, aux la sxakto estis efektive tre
profunda, aux sxi falis tre malrapide; cxar dum la dauxro de tiu
stranga defalo, ne mankis al sxi tempo por trankvile cxirkauxrigardi
kaj por konjekti pri kio estas okazonta STOP Unue, sxi klopodis rigardi
malsupren por esplori al kio sxi alvenas; sed klopodis vane, cxar
estis tie tro mallume STOP Tiam sxi ekobservis la murojn de la sxakto,
kaj rimarkis ke ili estas plenaj de sxrankoj kaj librobretoj; ankaux,
tie cxi kaj tie, sxi preterfalis landkartojn kaj bildojn pendigitajn
de najloj STOP Poste sxi, preterpasante, deprenis de apuda breto unu
fruktajxujon; sur gxi per grandaj literoj estas skribita MARMELADO STOP Sed jen por sxi granda cxagreno; cxar, enrigardante, la avidaj okuloj
vidis--nur blankan malplenon STOP Sxi ne volis lasi fali la fajencajxon,
pro la timo mortigi per gxi iun subulon, sed sukcesis post kelkaj
momentoj remeti gxin, preterpasante, en sxrankon STOP [Ilustrajxo: DE UNU EL LA BRETOJ, ALICIO,

cxiuj admiros mian maltimon; kaj, estonte, ecx pri falo de l' supro

povas kredi. STOP Malsupren, ankoraux malsupren STOP Cxu _neniam_ la falo finigxos STOP "Mi

ses kaj duono miloj da kilometroj. STOP (Alicio jam antauxe lernis en la
lerncxambro kelkajn tiuspecajn faktojn, kaj kvankam la nuna tempo
ne estis--pro manko da auxskultantoj--oportuna por elmontri sian
klerecon, tamen estis por sxi bona praktiko tradiri la faktojn. STOP "Jes, tio estas certe la gxusta interspaco, sed en kian latitudon aux
longitudon mi penetris? STOP (Pri kio estas latitudo kaj longitudo Alicio
havis nenian ideon, sed nur elparoli tiajn belege majestajn vortojn

de tiu strangajxo sxi certe _ne_ sopiris auxskultantojn); "mi ja devos

penis klinsaluti STOP Imagu al vi, karaj legantoj, kiel oni povus klinsaluti

la du demandoj, ne tre grave estis kiun "cxuon" sxi esprimis. STOP Sxi
sentis sin ekdormanta, kaj jxus komencis songxi ke sxi marsxas mano en
mano kun _Dajna_ kaj diras al sxi tre solene:--"_Dajna_, vi diru al
mi la veron; cxu iam vi mangxis vesperton? STOP kiam (ho, la surprizego! STOP subite sxi falis _plomp_ STOP sur amason da sekaj folioj STOP La falego
efektive finigxis STOP Pro la folioj sxi ricevis nenian vundon STOP Do, stariginte sin sur la
piedojn sxi rigardis supren STOP Super la kapo cxio estis malluma, sed
rekte antaux sxi vidigxis longa koridoro, kaj jen forkuras tra gxi la
Blanka Kuniklo STOP Ne perdinte ecx unu momenton, Alicio rapide postsekvis
kaj auxdis ke gxi diras, malaperante post murangulo, "se mi malfruos,
cxielo savu miajn orelojn! STOP En tiu momento sxi estis preskaux apuda; tamen, kiam sxi preterpasis
la angulon, la kuniklo jam malaperis STOP Kaj sxi trovis sin sola en ia
longa malalta halo lumigita per serio de lampoj kiuj pendas de la
plafono STOP Cxirkaux la halo estis pordoj; sed cxiuj estis fermitaj STOP Alicio do marsxis laux unu flanko kaj remarsxis laux la alia penante
malfermi la pordojn; sed cxiu el ili estis sxlosita, kaj Alicio
malgxoje marsxis laux la mezo kaj demandis al si, cxu sxi jam neniam
povos eliri la halon STOP Subite sxi rimarkis antaux si tripiedan tableton faritan el vitro, kaj
jen STOP kusxis sur gxi unu ora sxlosileto STOP Tuj la ideo frapis sxin ke
gxi nepre apartenas al iu el la halpordoj STOP Sed ho, ve STOP aux la seruroj
estis tro grandaj, aux la sxlosileto tro eta, cxar neniun el ili gxi
malfermis STOP Tamen, cxirkauxirante la duan fojon, sxi venis al malalta
kurteno, kiun sxi antauxe ne rimarkis, kaj malantaux la kurteno, jen
malgranda pordo alta je kvardek kelke da centimetroj; sxi ensxovis la
oran sxlosileton, kaj (ho, la gxojo! STOP gxi tauxgis STOP Malferminte la pordeton, Alicio trovis ke gxi kondukas en koridoreton
ne multe pli ampleksan ol ordinara rat-tunelo STOP Starigante sin sur la
genuoj, sxi direktis la rigardojn,--tra la koridoreto--en--la plej
belan gxardenon, kiun oni povas imagi STOP Ho STOP kiel sxi sopiris eligxi
tiun malluman halon, kaj cxirkauxvagadi inter jenaj helfloraj bedoj
kaj dolcxaj fontanoj STOP Sed tra tiu pordeto sxi ne povus trairigi ecx
la kapon STOP "Kaj ecx se la kapo bone trairus," ekpensis nia kompatinda
Alicio, "tre malmulte utilus _tio_ sen la sxultroj STOP Ho, se mi nur
havus la kapablon _teleskopigxi_ STOP Eble mi povus, se nur mi scius kiel
oni komencas la klopodon? STOP Cxar tiom da eksterordinaraj aferoj jam
en tiu tago okazis cxe sxi, Alicio ja komencis kredi ke neebla estas
preskaux nenio STOP Kompreneble neniel utilus staradi cxe la pordeto,
sekve sxi reiris al la tablo kun la ekespero trovi sur gxi alian
sxlosilon, aux eble libreton pri la arto teleskopigxi; cxi tiun fojon
sxi trovis sur gxi boteleton ("kiu certege ne kusxis tie antauxe,"
diris Alicio) kun surskribajxo, ligita cxirkaux la kolo, havanta la
vortojn TRINKU MIN per belegaj grandaj literoj surskribitajn STOP "Tre facile estas diri 'Trinku min'" pensis la sagxulineto, "sed
mi ne faros tion krom post plena esploro STOP Mi unue rigardu por vidi
cxu oni surskribis gxin per 'veneno.' STOP Cxar sxi ja antauxe legis
kelke da bonmoralaj rakontoj pri infanoj kiuj aux mortbruligxis, aux
estis englutitaj de sovagxaj bestoj, aux suferis diversajn aliajn
malagrablajxojn nur simple pro tio, ke ili ne volis atenti ian facilan
regulon de la amikoj ofte instruitan, tian ekzemple kia estas la
regulo ke brilvarmega fajrilo povas brulvundi la manon, se oni gxin
tenas tro longe; ankaux tio cxi, ke se oni tre profunde trancxos
la fingron, gxi kredeble sangos; kaj neniam sxi forgesis ke se oni
trinkos multe el botelo markita per 'veneno,' preskaux certe estas ke
pli malpli frue gxi malordigos la internajxon STOP Do, certigxinte ke cxi tiun botelon oni _ne_ markis per 'veneno',
Alicio kuragxis gustumi la enhavon STOP "Ja, tre bongusta gxi estas,"
diris sxi STOP (Sxajnis al sxi esti rava miksajxo farita el cxeriztorto,
sukerita ovajxo, ananaso, butersukerajxo kaj rostita buterpano STOP Do ne
mirinde estas ke tre baldaux la boteleto malplenigxis! STOP "Ho, kian strangan senton STOP mi ja nepre teleskopigxas! STOP Kaj fakte
gxuste tio okazis STOP Sxi havis jam malpli ol tridek centimetrojn da
alteco STOP Sxia vizagxo heligxis, cxar nun sxi havas altecon gxuste
tauxgan por transiri la pordeton en tiun belegan gxardenon STOP Tamen
sxi decidis atendi ankoraux kelkajn momentojn por sciigxi cxu sxi
malkreskos plue STOP Sxi sentis pri tio kelkan timon, "cxar"--diris
sxi--"povas okazi ke mi malkreskos gxis nulo, same kiel kandelo STOP Kian
aspekton mi havus en tiu okazo? STOP Kaj sxi penis imagi al si la aspekton
kiun kandelflamo havas post kiam oni estingis gxin STOP Post iom da tempo, rimarkinte ke nenio plu okazas, sxi decidis tuj iri
en la gxardenon STOP Sed ho ve STOP alveninte al la pordo, sxi eltrovis ke
sxi ne havas la oran sxlosileton; kaj irinte returne al la tablo por
reposedi gxin, (jen alia eltrovo! STOP sxi tute ne povis atingi gxin STOP Vidi
gxin tra la vitro sxi povis tre bone, kaj penegis grimpi sur unu el la
tri piedoj; sed gxi estis tro glitiga; kaj fine, ellacigxinte per la
vana klopodado, la kompatinduleto sidigxis sur la planko kaj ekploris STOP "Nu, do, tute ne utilas konduti tiamaniere," diris al si Alicio tre
severe STOP "Mi ordonas al vi tuj cxesi la ploron. STOP Sxi havis la kutimon
sin tre bone konsili (sed tre malofte agis laux la konsilo! STOP kaj
kelkfoje riprocxis sin tiel forte, ke sxi efektive devis plori;
kaj sxi unu fojon punfrapis sin sur la vango pro la ofendo ke sxi
trompis sin dum iu vetludo kiun sxi ludis kontraux si mem STOP (Nia
Alicio ja estis neordinara infano kaj tre sxatis sxajnigi ke sxi
estas du personoj. STOP "Sed tiu sxajnigo ne utilus nun"--sxi malgxoje
ekpensis--"cxar ja restas da mi apenaux suficxe por fari ecx unu
respektindan personon! STOP Baldaux tamen sxia rigardo falis sur vitran skatoleton, kiu kusxas sub
la tablo: malferminte gxin, sxi trovis interne tre malgrandan kukon,
sur kiu oni markis (per korintoj) la vortojn: "Mangxu Min. STOP "Nu," diris Alicio, "mi vin mangxos STOP Se vi igos min kreski, mi povos

nepre estos aux rosmaro aux hipopotamo; sed rememorante ke sxi mem
nun estas tre malgranda, sxi fine konstatis ke gxi estas nur muso

foriranta Muso STOP Poste cxiuj kriis hxore: "Jes, revenu, revenu. STOP Tamen
la Muso nur skuis malpacience la kapon, plirapidigis la pasxojn, kaj
malaperis STOP La Loro malkontente diris: "Estas domagxo ke gxi ne volis reveni,"
unu maljuna krabino profitis la okazon por diri al la filino: "Ha,
mia kara, tio estu por vi solena averto por ke neniam _vi_ perdu la
bonhumoron," kaj la malrespekta krabido akre respondis: "Vi fermu la
busxon, panjo; vi ja difektus la paciencon ecx al ostro. STOP "Ho, kiel mi volus ke nia _Dajna_ estu tie cxi," Alicio diris tion al
neniu aparte sed kvazaux sxi volis mem auxdi siajn pensojn, "sxi ja
kapablus tuj reporti gxin. STOP "Kiu do estas _Dajna_, se estas permesite tion demandi," diris
gxentile la Loro STOP Alicio respondis avide, cxar cxiam sxi estis preta
paroli pri sia kara katinjo STOP "_Dajna_ estas mia kato STOP Sxi estas la
plej bona muskaptisto kiun vi povus ecx imagi; kaj se vi vidus sxin

enfaldis sin per la vestoj kaj anoncis ke, cxar la noktaj vaporoj
malbone efikas sur la gorgxo, sxi devas hejmenigxi STOP La kanario kriis
per trempepanta vocxo al siaj idoj: "Forvenu, karuletoj, la horo jam
pasis, je kiu vi devis kusxigxi. STOP Pro diversaj tiaj pretekstoj cxiuj foriris unu post alia, gxis Alicio

cxirkauxsercxas, la Kuniklo rimarkis sxin, kaj per kolera vocxo

komencas malkreski STOP Tuj kiam sxi estis suficxe malalta por trairi

elskribi plenan historion de la akcidento, escepte nur la Lacerton,

plafonon STOP --"Kion vi scias pri cxi tiu afero? STOP la Regxo demandis al Alicio STOP "Nenion," sxi respondis STOP "Nenion ajn? STOP persistis la Regxo STOP "Nenion ajn. STOP "Tio estas tre grava," diris la Regxo turnante sin al la jxurintoj STOP Tiuj jxus komencis skribi tion sur la ardezoj STOP Sed la Blanka Kuniklo
tre sulkigis la brovojn, kaj faris al la Regxo malaproban geston,
dirante per tre respekta vocxo: "Kompreneble via Regxa Mosxto intencis

li dauxre diradis al si: "grava, malgrava, malgrava, grava" kvazaux li
eksperimentas kiu vorto havas la pli bonan sonon STOP Kelkaj jxurintoj skribis "grava," aliaj skribis "malgrava. STOP Alicio
povis mem vidi tion, cxar sxi staris suficxe proksime por rigardi sur
la ardezojn STOP "Tamen tio ne esta grava," sxi pensis STOP En tiu momento la Regxo subite ordonis "Silenton! STOP --Li ja en la
lastaj minutoj diligente skribis en sia notlibro--kaj nun li legis el

Alicio kunligigxis sur sxiaj genuoj, denove tiuj klarbluaj okuloj
de Alicio rigardas supren en sxiajn STOP Sxi kvazaux auxdis la verajn
vocxtonojn, kvazaux vidis tiun nur-Alician kapskuon (por postenigi la
vageman buklon, kiu cxiam malgraux cxio volas fali antaux la okuloj);
kaj dum sxi auxskultas--aux sxajnas auxskulti--la tuta cxirkauxajxo
farigxis plene posedata de tiuj strangaj songxvivajxoj STOP Jen la longa herbajxo murmuris cxe sxiaj piedoj cxar la Blanka Kuniklo
preterpasas--jen la timigita Muso plauxde nagxas tra la tutapuda al sxi
akvo--Jen sxi ekauxdis la tintadon de la tetasoj, dum la Martleporo
kun siaj kunuloj partoprenas la neniam finigxantan mangxadon, kaj
la altvocxajn kriojn de la Damo ordonanta la malfelicxajn gastojn
for, for al la ekzekutisto STOP Ankaux, jen la porkinfano ternadas sur
la dukinaj genuoj, dum frakasigxas cxirkauxe la teleroj kaj pladoj STOP Denove plenigis la aeron tiu stranga krio de la Grifo, tiuj gratoj
de l' Lacerta grifelo, la sufokaj blekoj de la subpremataj kobajoj;
kaj malproksime, auxdigxas la plorgxemoj de la Falsa Kelonio STOP Tre longe sxi sidadis, kun okuloj fermitaj, kaj preskaux kredis ke
sxi mem vagas en tiu stranga Mirlando, kvankam sxi bone konsciis ke,
se nur sxi malfermos la okulojn, la fantazioj malaperos, kaj cxio
refarigxos ordinara STOP Se sxi malfermos la okulojn, jam ne murmurigos la herbon Blanka

sed nur sxanceligxantaj kanoj; la tintadantaj tetasoj refarigxos

renaskigxante kiel krioj de la sxafpasxtisto; la infana ternado kaj
cxiuj aliaj strangaj bruoj farigxos--nur konfuzita bruaro de la
farmkorto; kaj, anstataux la profundaj gxemoj de la Falsa Kelonio,

jaroj estos mem plenagxa virino; kiel sxi kredeble gardos, dum la
maturaj jaroj, la simplan kaj ameman koron kiu karakterizas la nunan
infanecon; kiel sxi kredeble kolektos cxirkaux si aliajn infanojn, kaj
al _ili_ briligos la okulojn per multe da strangaj rakontoj, eble
ecx per tiu cxi stranga Songxo; kiel sxi kredeble simpatie partoprenos

PHANTASMAGORIA


CANTO I
The Trystyng


   ONE winter night, at half-past nine,
         Cold, tired, and cross, and muddy,
   I had come home, too late to dine,
   And supper, with cigars and wine,
         Was waiting in the study STOP There was a strangeness in the room,
         And Something white and wavy
   Was standing near me in the gloom
   _I_ took it for the carpet-broom
         Left by that careless slavey STOP But presently the Thing began
         To shiver and to sneeze:
   On which I said Come, come, my man STOP Thats a most inconsiderate plan STOP Less noise there, if you please STOP [Picture: The Thing standing by chair]

   Ive caught a cold, the Thing replies,
         Out there upon the landing STOP I turned to look in some surprise,
   And there, before my very eyes,
         A little Ghost was standing STOP He trembled when he caught my eye,
         And got behind a chair STOP How came you here, I said, and why STOP I never saw a thing so shy STOP Come out STOP Dont shiver there STOP He said Id gladly tell you how,
         And also tell you why;
   But (here he gave a little bow)
   Youre in so bad a temper now,
         Youd think it all a lie STOP And as to being in a fright,
         Allow me to remark
   That Ghosts have just as good a right
   In every way, to fear the light,
         As Men to fear the dark STOP No plea, said I, can well excuse
         Such cowardice in you:
   For Ghosts can visit when they choose,
   Whereas we Humans cant refuse
         To grant the interview STOP He said A flutter of alarm
         Is not unnatural, is it STOP I really feared you meant some harm:
   But, now I see that you are calm,
         Let me explain my visit STOP Houses are classed, I beg to state,
         According to the number
   Of Ghosts that they accommodate:
   (The Tenant merely counts as _weight_,
         With Coals and other lumber) STOP This is a one-ghost house, and you
         When you arrived last summer,
   May have remarked a Spectre who
   Was doing all that Ghosts can do
         To welcome the new-comer STOP In Villas this is always done
         However cheaply rented:
   For, though of course theres less of fun
   When there is only room for one,
         Ghosts have to be contented STOP That Spectre left you on the Third
         Since then youve not been haunted:
   For, as he never sent us word,
   Twas quite by accident we heard
         That any one was wanted STOP A Spectre has first choice, by right,
         In filling up a vacancy;
   Then Phantom, Goblin, Elf, and Sprite
   If all these fail them, they invite
         The nicest Ghoul that they can see STOP The Spectres said the place was low,
         And that you kept bad wine:
   So, as a Phantom had to go,
   And I was first, of course, you know,
         I couldnt well decline STOP No doubt, said I, they settled who
         Was fittest to be sent
   Yet still to choose a brat like you,
   To haunt a man of forty-two,
         Was no great compliment STOP Im not so young, Sir, he replied,
         As you might think STOP The fact is,
   In caverns by the water-side,
   And other places that Ive tried,
         Ive had a lot of practice:

   But I have never taken yet
         A strict domestic part,
   And in my flurry I forget
   The Five Good Rules of Etiquette
         We have to know by heart STOP My sympathies were warming fast
         Towards the little fellow:
   He was so utterly aghast
   At having found a Man at last,
         And looked so scared and yellow STOP [Picture: In caverns by the water-side]

   At least, I said, Im glad to find
         A Ghost is not a _dumb_ thing STOP But pray sit down: youll feel inclined
   (If, like myself, you have not dined)
         To take a snack of something:

   Though, certainly, you dont appear
         A thing to offer _food_ to STOP And then I shall be glad to hear
   If you will say them loud and clear
         The Rules that you allude to STOP Thanks STOP You shall hear them by and by STOP This _is_ a piece of luck STOP What may I offer you STOP said I STOP Well, since you _are_ so kind, Ill try
         A little bit of duck STOP _One_ slice STOP And may I ask you for
         Another drop of gravy STOP I sat and looked at him in awe,
   For certainly I never saw
         A thing so white and wavy STOP And still he seemed to grow more white,
         More vapoury, and wavier

Hys Fyve Rules


   MY Firstbut dont suppose, he said,
         Im setting you a riddle
   Isif your Victim be in bed,
   Dont touch the curtains at his head,
         But take them in the middle,

   And wave them slowly in and out,
         While drawing them asunder;
   And in a minutes time, no doubt,
   Hell raise his head and look about
         With eyes of wrath and wonder STOP And here you must on no pretence
         Make the first observation STOP Wait for the Victim to commence:
   No Ghost of any common sense
         Begins a conversation STOP [Picture: Ghostly border] If he should say _How came you here_ STOP (The way that _you_ began, Sir,)
   In such a case your course is clear
   _On the bats back_, _my little dear_ STOP Is the appropriate answer STOP If after this he says no more,
         Youd best perhaps curtail your
   Exertionsgo and shake the door,
   And then, if he begins to snore,
         Youll know the things a failure STOP By day, if he should be alone
         At home or on a walk
   You merely give a hollow groan,
   To indicate the kind of tone
         In which you mean to talk STOP But if you find him with his friends,
         The thing is rather harder STOP In such a case success depends
   On picking up some candle-ends,
         Or butter, in the larder STOP With this you make a kind of slide
         (It answers best with suet),
   On which you must contrive to glide,
   And swing yourself from side to side
         One soon learns how to do it STOP [Picture: And swing yourself from side to side]

   The Second tells us what is right
         In ceremonious calls:
   _First burn a blue or crimson light_
   (A thing I quite forgot to-night),
         _Then scratch the door or walls_ STOP I said Youll visit _here_ no more,
         If you attempt the Guy STOP Ill have no bonfires on _my_ floor
   And, as for scratching at the door,
         Id like to see you try STOP The Third was written to protect
         The interests of the Victim,
   And tells us, as I recollect,
   _To treat him with a grave respect_,
         _And not to contradict him_ STOP Thats plain, said I, as Tare and Tret,
         To any comprehension:
   I only wish _some_ Ghosts Ive met
   Would not so _constantly_ forget
         The maxim that you mention STOP Perhaps, he said, _you_ first transgressed
         The laws of hospitality:
   All Ghosts instinctively detest
   The Man that fails to treat his guest
         With proper cordiality STOP [Picture: And then youre sure to catch it  STOP  STOP . STOP If you address a Ghost as Thing STOP Or strike him with a hatchet,
   He is permitted by the King
   To drop all _formal_ parleying
         And then youre _sure_ to catch it STOP The Fourth prohibits trespassing
         Where other Ghosts are quartered:
   And those convicted of the thing
   (Unless when pardoned by the King)
         Must instantly be slaughtered STOP That simply means be cut up small:
         Ghosts soon unite anew STOP The process scarcely hurts at all
   Not more than when _you_ re what you call
         Cut up by a Review STOP The Fifth is one you may prefer
         That I should quote entire:
   _The King must be addressed as_ _Sir_ STOP _This_, _from a simple courtier_,
         _Is all the Laws require_:

   _But_, _should you wish to do the thing_
         _With out-and-out politeness_,
   _Accost him as_ _My Goblin King_ STOP _And always use_, _in answering_,
         _The phrase_ _Your Royal Whiteness_ STOP Im getting rather hoarse, I fear,
         After so much reciting:
   So, if you dont object, my dear,
   Well try a glass of bitter beer
         I think it looks inviting STOP [Picture: Well try a glass of bitter beer]

   AND did you really walk, said I,
         On such a wretched night STOP I always fancied Ghosts could fly
   If not exactly in the sky,
         Yet at a fairish height STOP Its very well, said he, for Kings
         To soar above the earth:
   But Phantoms often find that wings
   Like many other pleasant things
         Cost more than they are worth STOP Spectres of course are rich, and so
         Can buy them from the Elves:
   But _we_ prefer to keep below
   Theyre stupid company, you know,
         For any but themselves:

   For, though they claim to be exempt
         From pride, they treat a Phantom
   As something quite beneath contempt
   Just as no Turkey ever dreamt
         Of noticing a Bantam STOP [Picture: The phantom]

   They seem too proud, said I, to go
         To houses such as mine STOP Pray, how did they contrive to know
   So quickly that the place was low,
         And that I kept bad wine STOP Inspector Kobold came to you
         The little Ghost began STOP Here I broke inInspector who STOP Inspecting Ghosts is something new STOP Explain yourself, my man STOP His name is Kobold, said my guest:
         One of the Spectre order:
   Youll very often see him dressed
   In a yellow gown, a crimson vest,
         And a night-cap with a border STOP He tried the Brocken business first,
         But caught a sort of chill;
   So came to England to be nursed,
   And here it took the form of _thirst_,
         Which he complains of still STOP [Picture: And here it took the form of thirst]

   Port-wine, he says, when rich and sound,
         Warms his old bones like nectar:
   And as the inns, where it is found,
   Are his especial hunting-ground,
         We call him the _Inn-Spectre_ STOP I bore itbore it like a man
         This agonizing witticism STOP And nothing could be sweeter than
   My temper, till the Ghost began
         Some most provoking criticism STOP Cooks need not be indulged in waste;
         Yet still youd better teach them
   Dishes should have _some sort_ of taste STOP Pray, why are all the cruets placed
         Where nobody can reach them STOP That man of yours will never earn
         His living as a waiter STOP Is that queer _thing_ supposed to burn STOP (Its far too dismal a concern
         To call a Moderator) STOP The duck was tender, but the peas
         Were very much too old:
   And just remember, if you please,
   The _next_ time you have toasted cheese,
         Dont let them send it cold STOP Youd find the bread improved, I think,
         By getting better flour:
   And have you anything to drink
   That looks a _little_ less like ink,
         And isnt _quite_ so sour STOP Then, peering round with curious eyes,
         He muttered Goodness gracious STOP And so went on to criticise
   Your rooms an inconvenient size:
         Its neither snug nor spacious STOP That narrow window, I expect,
         Serves but to let the dusk in
   But please, said I, to recollect
   Twas fashioned by an architect
         Who pinned his faith on Ruskin STOP I dont care who he was, Sir, or
         On whom he pinned his faith STOP Constructed by whatever law,
   So poor a job I never saw,
         As Im a living Wraith STOP What a re-markable cigar STOP How much are they a dozen STOP I growled No matter what they are STOP Youre getting as familiar
         As if you were my cousin STOP Now thats a thing _I will not stand_,
         And so I tell you flat STOP Aha, said he, were getting grand STOP (Taking a bottle in his hand)
         Ill soon arrange for _that_ STOP And here he took a careful aim,
         And gaily cried Here goes STOP I tried to dodge it as it came,
   But somehow caught it, all the same,
         Exactly on my nose STOP And I remember nothing more
         That I can clearly fix,
   Till I was sitting on the floor,
   Repeating Two and five are four,
         But _five and two_ are six STOP What really passed I never learned,
         Nor guessed: I only know
   That, when at last my sense returned,
   The lamp, neglected, dimly burned
         The fire was getting low

   Through driving mists I seemed to see

   OH, when I was a little Ghost,
         A merry time had we STOP Each seated on his favourite post,
   We chumped and chawed the buttered toast
         They gave us for our tea STOP [Picture: We chumped and chawed the buttered toast]

   That story is in print STOP I cried STOP Dont say its not, because
   Its known as well as Bradshaws Guide STOP (The Ghost uneasily replied
         He hardly thought it was) STOP Its not in Nursery Rhymes STOP And yet
         I almost think it is
   Three little Ghosteses were set
   On posteses, you know, and ate
         Their buttered toasteses STOP I have the book; so if you doubt it
         I turned to search the shelf STOP Dont stir STOP he cried STOP Well do without it:
   I now remember all about it;
         I wrote the thing myself STOP It came out in a Monthly, or
         At least my agent said it did:
   Some literary swell, who saw
   It, thought it seemed adapted for
         The Magazine he edited STOP My father was a Brownie, Sir;
         My mother was a Fairy STOP The notion had occurred to her,
   The children would be happier,
         If they were taught to vary STOP The notion soon became a craze;
         And, when it once began, she
   Brought us all out in different ways
   One was a Pixy, two were Fays,
         Another was a Banshee;

   The Fetch and Kelpie went to school
         And gave a lot of trouble;
   Next came a Poltergeist and Ghoul,
   And then two Trolls (which broke the rule),
         A Goblin, and a Double

   (If thats a snuff-box on the shelf,
         He added with a yawn,
   Ill take a pinch)next came an Elf,
   And then a Phantom (thats myself),
         And last, a Leprechaun STOP [Picture: I stood and watched them in the hall] One day, some
   Spectres chanced to call,
         Dressed in the usual white:
   I stood and watched them in the hall,
   And couldnt make them out at all,
         They seemed so strange a sight STOP I wondered what on earth they were,
         That looked all head and sack;
   But Mother told me not to stare,
   And then she twitched me by the hair,
         And punched me in the back STOP Since then Ive often wished that I
         Had been a Spectre born STOP But whats the use STOP (He heaved a sigh. STOP _They_ are the ghost-nobility,
         And look on _us_ with scorn STOP My phantom-life was soon begun:
         When I was barely six,
   I went out with an older one
   And just at first I thought it fun,
         And learned a lot of tricks STOP Ive haunted dungeons, castles, towers
         Wherever I was sent:
   Ive often sat and howled for hours,
   Drenched to the skin with driving showers,
         Upon a battlement STOP Its quite old-fashioned now to groan
         When you begin to speak:
   This is the newest thing in tone
   And here (it chilled me to the bone)
         He gave an _awful_ squeak STOP Perhaps, he added, to _your_ ear
         That sounds an easy thing STOP Try it yourself, my little dear STOP It took _me_ something like a year,
         With constant practising STOP And when youve learned to squeak, my man,
         And caught the double sob,
   Youre pretty much where you began:
   Just try and gibber if you can STOP Thats something _like_ a job STOP _Ive_ tried it, and can only say
         Im sure you couldnt do it, e-
   ven if you practised night and day,
   Unless you have a turn that way,
         And natural ingenuity STOP Shakspeare I think it is who treats
         Of Ghosts, in days of old,
   Who gibbered in the Roman streets,
   Dressed, if you recollect, in sheets
         They must have found it cold STOP Ive often spent ten pounds on stuff,
         In dressing as a Double;
   But, though it answers as a puff,
   It never has effect enough
         To make it worth the trouble STOP [Picture: In dressing as a Double]

   Long bills soon quenched the little thirst
         I had for being funny STOP The setting-up is always worst:
   Such heaps of things you want at first,
         One must be made of money STOP For instance, take a Haunted Tower,
         With skull, cross-bones, and sheet;
   Blue lights to burn (say) two an hour,
   Condensing lens of extra power,
         And set of chains complete:

   What with the things you have to hire
         The fitting on the robe
   And testing all the coloured fire
   The outfit of itself would tire
         The patience of a Job STOP And then theyre so fastidious,
         The Haunted-House Committee:
   Ive often known them make a fuss
   Because a Ghost was French, or Russ,
         Or even from the City STOP Some dialects are objected to
         For one, the _Irish_ brogue is:
   And then, for all you have to do,
   One pound a week they offer you,
         And find yourself in Bogies STOP CANTO V

   DONT they consult the Victims, though STOP I said STOP They should, by rights,

         Said I, to pick and choose:
   But, in the case of men like me,
   I think Mine Host might fairly be
         Allowed to state his views STOP He said It really wouldnt pay
         Folk are so full of fancies STOP We visit for a single day,
   And whether then we go, or stay,
         Depends on circumstances STOP And, though we dont consult Mine Host
         Before the things arranged,
   Still, if he often quits his post,
   Or is not a well-mannered Ghost,
         Then you can have him changed STOP But if the hosts a man like you
         I mean a man of sense;
   And if the house is not too new
   Why, what has _that_, said I, to do
         With Ghosts convenience STOP A new house does not suit, you know
         Its such a job to trim it:
   But, after twenty years or so,
   The wainscotings begin to go,
         So twenty is the limit STOP To trim was not a phrase I could
         Remember having heard:
   Perhaps, I said, youll be so good
   As tell me what is understood
         Exactly by that word STOP [Picture: The wainscotings begin to go]

   It means the loosening all the doors,
         The Ghost replied, and laughed:
   It means the drilling holes by scores
   In all the skirting-boards and floors,
         To make a thorough draught STOP Youll sometimes find that one or two
         Are all you really need
   To let the wind come whistling through
   But _here_ therell be a lot to do STOP I faintly gasped Indeed STOP If Id been rather later, Ill
         Be bound, I added, trying
   (Most unsuccessfully) to smile,
   Youd have been busy all this while,
         Trimming and beautifying STOP Why, no, said he; perhaps I should
         Have stayed another minute
   But still no Ghost, thats any good,
   Without an introduction would
         Have ventured to begin it STOP The proper thing, as you were late,
         Was certainly to go:
   But, with the roads in such a state,
   I got the Knight-Mayors leave to wait
         For half an hour or so STOP Whos the Knight-Mayor STOP I cried STOP Instead
         Of answering my question,
   Well, if you dont know _that_, he said,
   Either you never go to bed,
         Or youve a grand digestion STOP He goes about and sits on folk
         That eat too much at night:
   His duties are to pinch, and poke,
   And squeeze them till they nearly choke STOP (I said It serves them right! STOP And folk who sup on things like these
         He muttered, eggs and bacon
   Lobsterand duckand toasted cheese
   If they dont get an awful squeeze,
         Im very much mistaken STOP He is immensely fat, and so
         Well suits the occupation:
   In point of fact, if you must know,
   We used to call him years ago,
         _The Mayor and Corporation_ STOP [Picture: He goes about and sits on folk]

   The day he was elected Mayor
         I _know_ that every Sprite meant
   To vote for _me_, but did not dare
   He was so frantic with despair
         And furious with excitement STOP [Picture: He ran to tell the King]

   When it was over, for a whim,
         He ran to tell the King;
   And being the reverse of slim,
   A two-mile trot was not for him
         A very easy thing STOP So, to reward him for his run
         (As it was baking hot,
   And he was over twenty stone),
   The King proceeded, half in fun,
         To knight him on the spot STOP Twas a great liberty to take STOP (I fired up like a rocket) STOP He did it just for punnings sake:
   The man, says Johnson, that would make
         A pun, would pick a pocket STOP A man, said he, is not a King STOP I argued for a while,
   And did my best to prove the thing
   The Phantom merely listening
         With a contemptuous smile STOP At last, when, breath and patience spent,
         I had recourse to smoking
   Your _aim_, he said, is excellent:
   Butwhen you call it _argument_
         Of course youre only joking STOP [Picture: The phantom sitting on chair]

   Stung by his cold and snaky eye,
         I roused myself at length
   To say At least I do defy
   The veriest sceptic to deny
         That union is strength STOP Thats true enough, said he, yet stay
         I listened in all meekness
   _Union_ is strength, Im bound to say;
   In fact, the things as clear as day;
         But _onions_ are a weakness STOP CANTO VI

   AS one who strives a hill to climb,
         Who never climbed before:
   Who finds it, in a little time,
   Grow every moment less sublime,
         And votes the thing a bore:

   Yet, having once begun to try,
         Dares not desert his quest,
   But, climbing, ever keeps his eye
   On one small hut against the sky
         Wherein he hopes to rest:

   Who climbs till nerve and force are spent,
         With many a puff and pant:
   Who still, as rises the ascent,
   In language grows more violent,
         Although in breath more scant:

   Who, climbing, gains at length the place
         That crowns the upward track STOP And, entering with unsteady pace,
   Receives a buffet in the face
         That lands him on his back:

   [Picture: Decorative border of man climbing hall] And feels himself,
   like one in sleep,
         Glide swiftly down again,

         Conviction to a ghost,
   And found it quite a different thing
   From any human arguing,
         Yet dared not quit my post

   But, keeping still the end in view
         To which I hoped to come,
   I strove to prove the matter true

         Into an axiom:

   Commencing every single phrase
         With therefore or because,
   I blindly reeled, a hundred ways,
   About the syllogistic maze,
         Unconscious where I was STOP Quoth he Thats regular clap-trap:

         Was never seen before STOP Youre like a man I used to meet,

   Scorched both his slippers off his feet STOP I said _Thats very curious_ STOP [Picture: Scorched both his slippers off his feet]

   Well, it _is_ curious, I agree,

         To spend the night in smoking,
   And then to find that its in vain
   And Ive to do it all again

         To mutter some excuse STOP Who can have patience with a man
   Thats got no more discretion than

   To keep me waiting here, instead
         Of telling me at once
   That this was not the house STOP he said STOP There, thatll dobe off to bed STOP Dont gape like that, you dunce STOP Its very fine to throw the blame
         On _me_ in such a fashion STOP Why didnt you enquire my name
   The very minute that you came STOP I answered in a passion STOP Of course it worries you a bit

   Theyll send you some inferior Sprite,
   Wholl keep you in a constant fright
         And spoil your soundest naps STOP Tell him youll stand no sort of trick;
         Then, if he leers and chuckles,
   You just be handy with a stick
   (Mind that its pretty hard and thick)
         And rap him on the knuckles STOP Then carelessly remark Old coon STOP Perhaps youre not aware
   That, if you dont behave, youll soon

   _I_ prophesy therell be a row,
         And Tibbs will have the best of it STOP [Picture: And Tibbs will have the best of it]

   Then, as my tears could never bring
         The friendly Phantom back,
   It seemed to me the proper thing
   To mix another glass, and sing
         The following Coronach STOP _And art thou gone_, _beloved Ghost_ STOP _Best of Familiars_ STOP _Nay then_, _farewell_, _my duckling roast_,
   _Farewell_, _farewell_, _my tea and toast_,
         _My meerschaum and cigars_ STOP _The hues of life are dull and gray_,
         _The sweets of life insipid_,
   _When_ thou, _my charmer_, _art away_
   _Old Brick_, _or rather_, _let me say_,
         _Old Parallelepiped_ STOP Instead of singing Verse the Third,
         I ceasedabruptly, rather:
   But, after such a splendid word
   I felt that it would be absurd
         To try it any farther STOP So with a yawn I went my way
         To seek the welcome downy,
   And slept, and dreamed till break of day
   Of Poltergeist and Fetch and Fay
         And Leprechaun and Brownie STOP For years Ive not been visited
         By any kind of Sprite;
   Yet still they echo in my head,
   Those parting words, so kindly said,
         Old Turnip-top, good-night STOP [Picture: The ghost]




ECHOES


         LADY Clara Vere de Vere
         Was eight years old, she said:
   Every ringlet, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden thread STOP She took her little porringer:
         Of me she shall not win renown:
   For the baseness of its nature shall have strength to drag her down STOP Sisters and brothers, little Maid STOP There stands the Inspector at thy door:
   Like a dog, he hunts for boys who know not two and two are four STOP Kind words are more than coronets,
         She said, and wondering looked at me:
   It is the dead unhappy night, and I must hurry home to tea STOP A SEA DIRGE


                  [Picture: The sea, beach and children]

   THERE are certain thingsas, a spider, a ghost,
      The income-tax, gout, an umbrella for three
   That I hate, but the thing that I hate the most
      Is a thing they call the Sea STOP Pour some salt water over the floor
      Ugly Im sure youll allow it to be:
   Suppose it extended a mile or more,
      _Thats_ very like the Sea STOP Beat a dog till it howls outright
      Cruel, but all very well for a spree:
   Suppose that he did so day and night,
      _That_ would be like the Sea STOP I had a vision of nursery-maids;
      Tens of thousands passed by me
   All leading children with wooden spades,
      And this was by the Sea STOP Who invented those spades of wood STOP Who was it cut them out of the tree STOP None, I think, but an idiot could
      Or one that loved the Sea STOP It is pleasant and dreamy, no doubt, to float
      With thoughts as boundless, and souls as free:
   But, suppose you are very unwell in the boat,
      How do you like the Sea STOP [Picture: And this was by the sea]

   There is an insect that people avoid
      (Whence is derived the verb to flee) STOP Where have you been by it most annoyed STOP In lodgings by the Sea STOP If you like your coffee with sand for dregs,
      A decided hint of salt in your tea,
   And a fishy taste in the very eggs
      By all means choose the Sea STOP And if, with these dainties to drink and eat,
      You prefer not a vestige of grass or tree,
   And a chronic state of wet in your feet,
      ThenI recommend the Sea STOP For _I_ have friends who dwell by the coast
      Pleasant friends they are to me STOP It is when I am with them I wonder most
      That anyone likes the Sea STOP They take me a walk: though tired and stiff,
      To climb the heights I madly agree;
   And, after a tumble or so from the cliff,
      They kindly suggest the Sea STOP I try the rocks, and I think it cool
      That they laugh with such an excess of glee,
   As I heavily slip into every pool
      That skirts the cold cold Sea STOP [Picture: As I heavily slip into every pool]

HIAWATHAS PHOTOGRAPHING


[In an age of imitation, I can claim no special merit for this slight
attempt at doing what is known to be so easy STOP Any fairly practised
writer, with the slightest ear for rhythm, could compose, for hours
together, in the easy running metre of The Song of Hiawatha STOP Having,
then, distinctly stated that I challenge no attention in the following
little poem to its merely verbal jingle, I must beg the candid reader to
confine his criticism to its treatment of the subject. STOP FROM his shoulder Hiawatha
   Took the camera of rosewood,
   Made of sliding, folding rosewood;
   Neatly put it all together STOP In its case it lay compactly,
   Folded into nearly nothing;
   But he opened out the hinges,
   Pushed and pulled the joints and hinges,
   Till it looked all squares and oblongs,
   Like a complicated figure
   In the Second Book of Euclid STOP [Picture: The camera]

      This he perched upon a tripod
   Crouched beneath its dusky cover
   Stretched his hand, enforcing silence
   Said, Be motionless, I beg you STOP Mystic, awful was the process STOP All the family in order
   Sat before him for their pictures:
   Each in turn, as he was taken,
   Volunteered his own suggestions,
   His ingenious suggestions STOP First the Governor, the Father:
   He suggested velvet curtains
   Looped about a massy pillar;
   And the corner of a table,
   Of a rosewood dining-table STOP He would hold a scroll of something,
   Hold it firmly in his left-hand;
   He would keep his right-hand buried
   (Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat;
   He would contemplate the distance
   With a look of pensive meaning,
   As of ducks that die ill tempests STOP Grand, heroic was the notion:
   Yet the picture failed entirely:
   Failed, because he moved a little,
   Moved, because he couldnt help it STOP [Picture: First the Governor, the Father]

      Next, his better half took courage;
   _She_ would have her picture taken STOP She came dressed beyond description,
   Dressed in jewels and in satin
   Far too gorgeous for an empress STOP Gracefully she sat down sideways,
   With a simper scarcely human,
   Holding in her hand a bouquet
   Rather larger than a cabbage STOP All the while that she was sitting,
   Still the lady chattered, chattered,
   Like a monkey in the forest STOP Am I sitting still STOP she asked him STOP Is my face enough in profile STOP Shall I hold the bouquet higher STOP Will it came into the picture STOP And the picture failed completely STOP [Picture: Next the Son, the Stunning-Cantab]

      Next the Son, the Stunning-Cantab:
   He suggested curves of beauty,
   Curves pervading all his figure,
   Which the eye might follow onward,
   Till they centered in the breast-pin,
   Centered in the golden breast-pin STOP He had learnt it all from Ruskin
   (Author of The Stones of Venice,
   Seven Lamps of Architecture,
   Modern Painters, and some others);
   And perhaps he had not fully
   Understood his authors meaning;
   But, whatever was the reason,
   All was fruitless, as the picture
   Ended in an utter failure STOP [Picture: Next to him the eldest daughter]

      Next to him the eldest daughter:
   She suggested very little,
   Only asked if he would take her
   With her look of passive beauty STOP Her idea of passive beauty
   Was a squinting of the left-eye,
   Was a drooping of the right-eye,
   Was a smile that went up sideways
   To the corner of the nostrils STOP Hiawatha, when she asked him,
   Took no notice of the question,
   Looked as if he hadnt heard it;
   But, when pointedly appealed to,
   Smiled in his peculiar manner,
   Coughed and said it didnt matter,
   Bit his lip and changed the subject STOP Nor in this was he mistaken,
   As the picture failed completely STOP So in turn the other sisters STOP [Picture: Last, the youngest son was taken]

      Last, the youngest son was taken:
   Very rough and thick his hair was,
   Very round and red his face was,
   Very dusty was his jacket,
   Very fidgety his manner STOP And his overbearing sisters
   Called him names he disapproved of:
   Called him Johnny, Daddys Darling,
   Called him Jacky, Scrubby School-boy STOP And, so awful was the picture,
   In comparison the others
   Seemed, to ones bewildered fancy,
   To have partially succeeded STOP Finally my Hiawatha
   Tumbled all the tribe together,
   (Grouped is not the right expression),
   And, as happy chance would have it
   Did at last obtain a picture
   Where the faces all succeeded:
   Each came out a perfect likeness STOP Then they joined and all abused it,
   Unrestrainedly abused it,
   As the worst and ugliest picture
   They could possibly have dreamed of STOP Giving one such strange expressions
   Sullen, stupid, pert expressions STOP Really any one would take us
   (Any one that did not know us)
   For the most unpleasant people STOP (Hiawatha seemed to think so,
   Seemed to think it not unlikely) STOP All together rang their voices,
   Angry, loud, discordant voices,
   As of dogs that howl in concert,
   As of cats that wail in chorus STOP But my Hiawathas patience,
   His politeness and his patience,
   Unaccountably had vanished,
   And he left that happy party STOP Neither did he leave them slowly,
   With the calm deliberation,
   The intense deliberation
   Of a photographic artist:
   But he left them in a hurry,
   Left them in a mighty hurry,
   Stating that he would not stand it,
   Stating in emphatic language
   What hed be before hed stand it STOP Hurriedly he packed his boxes:
   Hurriedly the porter trundled
   On a barrow all his boxes:
   Hurriedly he took his ticket:
   Hurriedly the train received him:
   Thus departed Hiawatha STOP [Picture: Thus departed Hiawatha]




MELANCHOLETTA


   WITH saddest music all day long
      She soothed her secret sorrow:
   At night she sighed I fear twas wrong
      Such cheerful words to borrow STOP Dearest, a sweeter, sadder song
      Ill sing to thee to-morrow STOP I thanked her, but I could not say
      That I was glad to hear it:
   I left the house at break of day,
      And did not venture near it
   Till time, I hoped, had worn away
      Her grief, for nought could cheer it STOP [Picture: At night she signed]

   My dismal sister STOP Couldst thou know
      The wretched home thou keepest STOP Thy brother, drowned in daily woe,
      Is thankful when thou sleepest;
   For if I laugh, however low,
      When thourt awake, thou weepest STOP I took my sister tother day
      (Excuse the slang expression)
   To Sadlers Wells to see the play
      In hopes the new impression
   Might in her thoughts, from grave to gay
      Effect some slight digression STOP I asked three gay young dogs from town
      To join us in our folly,
   Whose mirth, I thought, might serve to drown
      My sisters melancholy:
   The lively Jones, the sportive Brown,
      And Robinson the jolly STOP The maid announced the meal in tones
      That I myself had taught her,
   Meant to allay my sisters moans
      Like oil on troubled water:
   I rushed to Jones, the lively Jones,
      And begged him to escort her STOP Vainly he strove, with ready wit,
      To joke about the weather
   To ventilate the last _on dit_
      To quote the price of leather
   She groaned Here I and Sorrow sit:
      Let us lament together STOP I urged Youre wasting time, you know:
      Delay will spoil the venison STOP My heart is wasted with my woe STOP There is no restin Venice, on
   The Bridge of Sighs STOP she quoted low
      From Byron and from Tennyson STOP I need not tell of soup and fish
      In solemn silence swallowed,
   The sobs that ushered in each dish,
      And its departure followed,
   Nor yet my suicidal wish
      To _be_ the cheese I hollowed STOP Some desperate attempts were made
      To start a conversation;
   Madam, the sportive Brown essayed,
      Which kind of recreation,
   Hunting or fishing, have you made
      Your special occupation STOP Her lips curved downwards instantly,
      As if of india-rubber STOP Hounds _in full cry_ I like, said she:
      (Oh how I longed to snub her! STOP Of fish, a whales the one for me,
      _It is so full of blubber_ STOP The nights performance was King John STOP Its dull, she wept, and so-so STOP Awhile I let her tears flow on,
      She said they soothed her woe so STOP At length the curtain rose upon
      Bombastes Furioso STOP In vain we roared; in vain we tried
      To rouse her into laughter:
   Her pensive glances wandered wide
      From orchestra to rafter
   _Tier upon tier_ STOP she said, and sighed;
      And silence followed after STOP [Picture: Sighing at the table]




A VALENTINE


[Sent to a friend who had complained that I was glad enough to see him
when he came, but didnt seem to miss him if he stayed away. STOP And cannot pleasures, while they last,
   Be actual unless, when past,
   They leave us shuddering and aghast,
         With anguish smarting STOP And cannot friends be firm and fast,
         And yet bear parting STOP And must I then, at Friendships call,
   Calmly resign the little all
   (Trifling, I grant, it is and small)
         I have of gladness,
   And lend my being to the thrall
         Of gloom and sadness STOP And think you that I should be dumb,
   And full _dolorum omnium_,
   Excepting when _you_ choose to come
         And share my dinner STOP At other times be sour and glum
         And daily thinner STOP Must he then only live to weep,
   Whod prove his friendship true and deep
   By day a lonely shadow creep,
         At night-time languish,
   Oft raising in his broken sleep
         The moan of anguish STOP The lover, if for certain days
   His fair one be denied his gaze,
   Sinks not in grief and wild amaze,
         But, wiser wooer,
   He spends the time in writing lays,
         And posts them to her STOP And if the verse flow free and fast,
   Till even the poet is aghast,
   A touching Valentine at last
         The post shall carry,
   When thirteen days are gone and past
         Of February STOP Farewell, dear friend, and when we meet,
   In desert waste or crowded street,
   Perhaps before this week shall fleet,
         Perhaps to-morrow STOP I trust to find _your_ heart the seat
         Of wasting sorrow STOP THE THREE VOICES


The First Voice


   HE trilled a carol fresh and free,
   He laughed aloud for very glee:
   There came a breeze from off the sea:

             [Picture: There came a breeze from off the sea]

   It passed athwart the glooming flat
   It fanned his forehead as he sat
   It lightly bore away his hat,

   All to the feet of one who stood
   Like maid enchanted in a wood,
   Frowning as darkly as she could STOP With huge umbrella, lank and brown,
   Unerringly she pinned it down,
   Right through the centre of the crown STOP Then, with an aspect cold and grim,
   Regardless of its battered rim,
   She took it up and gave it him STOP A while like one in dreams he stood,
   Then faltered forth his gratitude
   In words just short of being rude:

   For it had lost its shape and shine,
   And it had cost him four-and-nine,
   And he was going out to dine STOP [Picture: Unerringly she pinned it down]

   To dine STOP she sneered in acid tone STOP To bend thy being to a bone
   Clothed in a radiance not its own STOP The tear-drop trickled to his chin:
   There was a meaning in her grin
   That made him feel on fire within STOP Term it not radiance, said he:
   Tis solid nutriment to me STOP Dinner is Dinner: Tea is Tea STOP And she Yea so STOP Yet wherefore cease STOP Let thy scant knowledge find increase STOP Say Men are Men, and Geese are Geese STOP He moaned: he knew not what to say STOP The thought That I could get away STOP Strove with the thought But I must stay STOP To dine STOP she shrieked in dragon-wrath STOP To swallow wines all foam and froth STOP To simper at a table-cloth STOP Say, can thy noble spirit stoop
   To join the gormandising troup
   Who find a solace in the soup STOP Canst thou desire or pie or puff STOP Thy well-bred manners were enough,
   Without such gross material stuff STOP Yet well-bred men, he faintly said,
   Are not willing to be fed:
   Nor are they well without the bread STOP Her visage scorched him ere she spoke:
   There are, she said, a kind of folk
   Who have no horror of a joke STOP Such wretches live: they take their share
   Of common earth and common air:
   We come across them here and there:

   We grant themthere is no escape
   A sort of semi-human shape
   Suggestive of the man-like Ape STOP In all such theories, said he,
   One fixed exception there must be STOP That is, the Present Company STOP Baffled, she gave a wolfish bark:
   He, aiming blindly in the dark,
   With random shaft had pierced the mark STOP She felt that her defeat was plain,
   Yet madly strove with might and main
   To get the upper hand again STOP Fixing her eyes upon the beach,
   As though unconscious of his speech,
   She said Each gives to more than each STOP He could not answer yea or nay:
   He faltered Gifts may pass away STOP Yet knew not what he meant to say STOP If that be so, she straight replied,
   Each heart with each doth coincide STOP What boots it STOP For the world is wide STOP [Picture: He faltered Gifts may pass away]

   The world is but a Thought, said he:
   The vast unfathomable sea
   Is but a Notionunto me STOP And darkly fell her answer dread
   Upon his unresisting head,
   Like half a hundredweight of lead STOP The Good and Great must ever shun
   That reckless and abandoned one
   Who stoops to perpetrate a pun STOP The man that smokesthat reads the _Times_
   That goes to Christmas Pantomimes
   Is capable of _any_ crimes STOP He felt it was his turn to speak,
   And, with a shamed and crimson cheek,
   Moaned This is harder than Bezique STOP But when she asked him Wherefore so STOP He felt his very whiskers glow,
   And frankly owned I do not know STOP [Picture: This is harder than Bezique! STOP While, like broad waves of golden grain,
   Or sunlit hues on cloistered pane,
   His colour came and went again STOP Pitying his obvious distress,
   Yet with a tinge of bitterness,
   She said The More exceeds the Less STOP A truth of such undoubted weight,
   He urged, and so extreme in date,
   It were superfluous to state STOP Roused into sudden passion, she
   In tone of cold malignity:
   To others, yea: but not to thee STOP But when she saw him quail and quake,
   And when he urged For pitys sake STOP Once more in gentle tones she spake STOP Thought in the mind doth still abide
   That is by Intellect supplied,
   And within that Idea doth hide:

   And he, that yearns the truth to know,
   Still further inwardly may go,
   And find Idea from Notion flow:

   And thus the chain, that sages sought,
   Is to a glorious circle wrought,
   For Notion hath its source in Thought STOP So passed they on with even pace:
   Yet gradually one might trace
   A shadow growing on his face STOP [Picture: A shadow growing on his face]



The Second Voice


            [Picture: They walked beside the wave-worn beach]

   They walked beside the wave-worn beach;
   Her tongue was very apt to teach,
   And now and then he did beseech

   She would abate her dulcet tone,
   Because the talk was all her own,
   And he was dull as any drone STOP She urged No cheese is made of chalk:
   And ceaseless flowed her dreary talk,
   Tuned to the footfall of a walk STOP Her voice was very full and rich,
   And, when at length she asked him Which STOP It mounted to its highest pitch STOP He a bewildered answer gave,
   Drowned in the sullen moaning wave,
   Lost in the echoes of the cave STOP He answered her he knew not what:
   Like shaft from bow at random shot,
   He spoke, but she regarded not STOP She waited not for his reply,
   But with a downward leaden eye
   Went on as if he were not by

   Sound argument and grave defence,
   Strange questions raised on Why STOP and Whence STOP And wildly tangled evidence STOP When he, with racked and whirling brain,
   Feebly implored her to explain,
   She simply said it all again STOP Wrenched with an agony intense,
   He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense,
   And careless of all consequence:

   MindI believeis EssenceEnt
   Abstractthat isan Accident
   Which wethat is to sayI meant

   When, with quick breath and cheeks all flushed,
   At length his speech was somewhat hushed,
   She looked at him, and he was crushed STOP It needed not her calm reply:
   She fixed him with a stony eye,
   And he could neither fight nor fly STOP While she dissected, word by word,
   His speech, half guessed at and half heard,
   As might a cat a little bird STOP [Picture: He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense]

   Then, having wholly overthrown
   His views, and stripped them to the bone,
   Proceeded to unfold her own STOP Shall Man be Man STOP And shall he miss
   Of other thoughts no thought but this,
   Harmonious dews of sober bliss STOP What boots it STOP Shall his fevered eye
   Through towering nothingness descry
   The grisly phantom hurry by STOP And hear dumb shrieks that fill the air;
   See mouths that gape, and eyes that stare
   And redden in the dusky glare STOP The meadows breathing amber light,
   The darkness toppling from the height,
   The feathery train of granite Night STOP Shall he, grown gray among his peers,
   Through the thick curtain of his tears
   Catch glimpses of his earlier years,

                       [Picture: Shall Man be Man? STOP And hear the sounds he knew of yore,
   Old shufflings on the sanded floor,
   Old knuckles tapping at the door STOP Yet still before him as he flies
   One pallid form shall ever rise,
   And, bodying forth in glassy eyes

   The vision of a vanished good,
   Low peering through the tangled wood,
   Shall freeze the current of his blood STOP Still from each fact, with skill uncouth
   And savage rapture, like a tooth
   She wrenched some slow reluctant truth STOP Till, like a silent water-mill,
   When summer suns have dried the rill,
   She reached a full stop, and was still STOP Dead calm succeeded to the fuss,
   As when the loaded omnibus
   Has reached the railway terminus:

   When, for the tumult of the street,
   Is heard the engines stifled beat,
   The velvet tread of porters feet STOP With glance that ever sought the ground,
   She moved her lips without a sound,
   And every now and then she frowned STOP He gazed upon the sleeping sea,
   And joyed in its tranquillity,
   And in that silence dead, but she

   To muse a little space did seem,
   Then, like the echo of a dream,
   Harked back upon her threadbare theme STOP Still an attentive ear he lent
   But could not fathom what she meant:
   She was not deep, nor eloquent STOP He marked the ripple on the sand:
   The even swaying of her hand
   Was all that he could understand STOP He saw in dreams a drawing-room,
   Where thirteen wretches sat in gloom,
   Waitinghe thought he knew for whom:

   He saw them drooping here and there,
   Each feebly huddled on a chair,
   In attitudes of blank despair:

   Oysters were not more mute than they,
   For all their brains were pumped away,
   And they had nothing more to say

   Save one, who groaned Three hours are gone STOP Who shrieked Well wait no longer, John STOP Tell them to set the dinner on STOP The vision passed: the ghosts were fled:
   He saw once more that woman dread:
   He heard once more the words she said STOP He left her, and he turned aside:
   He sat and watched the coming tide
   Across the shores so newly dried STOP [Picture: He sat and watched the coming tide]

   He wondered at the waters clear,
   The breeze that whispered in his ear,
   The billows heaving far and near,

   And why he had so long preferred
   To hang upon her every word:
   In truth, he said, it was absurd STOP [Picture: He sits]



The Third Voice


            [Picture: Quick tears were raining down his face]

   Not long this transport held its place:
   Within a little moments space
   Quick tears were raining down his face

   His heart stood still, aghast with fear;
   A wordless voice, nor far nor near,
   He seemed to hear and not to hear STOP Tears kindle not the doubtful spark STOP If so, why not STOP Of this remark
   The bearings are profoundly dark STOP Her speech, he said, hath caused this pain STOP Easier I count it to explain
   The jargon of the howling main,

   Or, stretched beside some babbling brook,
   To con, with inexpressive look,
   An unintelligible book STOP Low spake the voice within his head,
   In words imagined more than said,
   Soundless as ghosts intended tread:

   If thou art duller than before,
   Why quittedst thou the voice of lore STOP Why not endure, expecting more STOP Rather than that, he groaned aghast,
   Id writhe in depths of cavern vast,
   Some loathly vampires rich repast STOP [Picture: He groaned aghast]

   Twere hard, it answered, themes immense
   To coop within the narrow fence
   That rings _thy_ scant intelligence STOP Not so, he urged, nor once alone:
   But there was something in her tone
   That chilled me to the very bone STOP Her style was anything but clear,
   And most unpleasantly severe;
   Her epithets were very queer STOP And yet, so grand were her replies,
   I could not choose but deem her wise;
   I did not dare to criticise;

   Nor did I leave her, till she went
   So deep in tangled argument
   That all my powers of thought were spent STOP A little whisper inly slid,
   Yet truth is truth: you know you did STOP A little wink beneath the lid STOP And, sickened with excess of dread,
   Prone to the dust he bent his head,
   And lay like one three-quarters dead

   The whisper left himlike a breeze
   Lost in the depths of leafy trees
   Left him by no means at his ease STOP Once more he weltered in despair,
   With hands, through denser-matted hair,
   More tightly clenched than then they were STOP When, bathed in Dawn of living red,
   Majestic frowned the mountain head,
   Tell me my fault, was all he said STOP When, at high Noon, the blazing sky
   Scorched in his head each haggard eye,

   Smiled grimly on the solemn fun,
   Alack, he sighed, what _have_ I done STOP [Picture: Tortured, unaided, and alone]

   But saddest, darkest was the sight,
   When the cold grasp of leaden Night
   Dashed him to earth, and held him tight STOP Tortured, unaided, and alone,
   Thunders were silence to his groan,
   Bagpipes sweet music to its tone:

   What STOP Ever thus, in dismal round,
   Shall Pain and Mystery profound
   Pursue me like a sleepless hound,

   With crimson-dashed and eager jaws,
   Me, still in ignorance of the cause,
   Unknowing what I broke of laws STOP The whisper to his ear did seem
   Like echoed flow of silent stream,
   Or shadow of forgotten dream,

   The whisper trembling in the wind:
   Her fate with thine was intertwined,
   So spake it in his inner mind:

                [Picture: a scared dullard, gibbering low]

   Each orbed on each a baleful star:
   Each proved the others blight and bar:

   AND SHE, AN AVALANCHE OF WOE STOP TEMA CON VARIAZIONI


[Why is it that Poetry has never yet been subjected to that process of
Dilution which has proved so advantageous to her sister-art Music STOP The
Diluter gives us first a few notes of some well-known Air, then a dozen
bars of his own, then a few more notes of the Air, and so on alternately:
thus saving the listener, if not from all risk of recognising the melody
at all, at least from the too-exciting transports which it might produce
in a more concentrated form STOP The process is termed setting by
Composers, and any one, that has ever experienced the emotion of being
unexpectedly set down in a heap of mortar, will recognise the
truthfulness of this happy phrase STOP For truly, just as the genuine Epicure lingers lovingly over a morsel of
supreme Venisonwhose every fibre seems to murmur Excelsior!yet

   And love me, it was sure to dye

                       [Picture: Five little girls]

   FIVE little girls, of Five, Four, Three, Two, One:
   Rolling on the hearthrug, full of tricks and fun STOP Five rosy girls, in years from Ten to Six:
   Sitting down to lessonsno more time for tricks STOP Five growing girls, from Fifteen to Eleven:
   Music, Drawing, Languages, and food enough for seven STOP [Picture: Now tell me which you mean]

   Five winsome girls, from Twenty to Sixteen:

                    [Picture: Child on old mans knee]

   How shall I be a poet STOP How shall I write in rhyme STOP You told me once the very wish
      Partook of the sublime STOP Then tell me how STOP Dont put me off
      With your another time STOP The old man smiled to see him,
      To hear his sudden sally;
   He liked the lad to speak his mind
      Enthusiastically;
   And thought Theres no hum-drum in him,
      Nor any shilly-shally STOP And would you be a poet
      Before youve been to school STOP Ah, well STOP I hardly thought you
      So absolute a fool STOP First learn to be spasmodic
      A very simple rule STOP For first you write a sentence,
      And then you chop it small;
   Then mix the bits, and sort them out
      Just as they chance to fall:
   The order of the phrases makes
      No difference at all STOP Then, if youd be impressive,
      Remember what I say,
   That abstract qualities begin
      With capitals alway:
   The True, the Good, the Beautiful
      Those are the things that pay STOP Next, when you are describing
      A shape, or sound, or tint;
   Dont state the matter plainly,
      But put it in a hint;
   And learn to look at all things
      With a sort of mental squint STOP For instance, if I wished, Sir,
      Of mutton-pies to tell,
   Should I say dreams of fleecy flocks
      Pent in a wheaten cell STOP Why, yes, the old man said: that phrase
      Would answer very well STOP Then fourthly, there are epithets
      That suit with any word
   As well as Harveys Reading Sauce
      With fish, or flesh, or bird
   Of these, wild, lonely, weary, strange,
      Are much to be preferred STOP And will it do, O will it do
      To take them in a lump
   As the wild man went his weary way
      To a strange and lonely pump STOP Nay, nay STOP You must not hastily
      To such conclusions jump STOP [Picture: The wild man went his weary way]

   Such epithets, like pepper,
      Give zest to what you write;
   And, if you strew them sparely,
      They whet the appetite:
   But if you lay them on too thick,
      You spoil the matter quite STOP Last, as to the arrangement:
      Your reader, you should show him,
   Must take what information he
      Can get, and look for no im-
   mature disclosure of the drift
      And purpose of your poem STOP Therefore, to test his patience
      How much he can endure
   Mention no places, names, or dates,
      And evermore be sure
   Throughout the poem to be found
      Consistently obscure STOP First fix upon the limit
      To which it shall extend:
   Then fill it up with Padding
      (Beg some of any friend):
   Your great SENSATION-STANZA
      You place towards the end STOP And what is a Sensation,
      Grandfather, tell me, pray STOP I think I never heard the word
      So used before to-day:
   Be kind enough to mention one
      _Exempli gratia_ STOP And the old man, looking sadly
      Across the garden-lawn,
   Where here and there a dew-drop
      Yet glittered in the dawn,
   Said Go to the Adelphi,
      And see the Colleen Bawn STOP The word is due to Boucicault
      The theory is his,
   Where Life becomes a Spasm,
      And History a Whiz:
   If that is not Sensation,
      I dont know what it is STOP Now try your hand, ere Fancy
      Have lost its present glow
   And then, his grandson added,
      Well publish it, you know:
   Green clothgold-lettered at the back
      In duodecimo STOP Then proudly smiled that old man
      To see the eager lad
   Rush madly for his pen and ink
      And for his blotting-pad
   But, when he thought of _publishing_,
      His face grew stern and sad STOP [Picture: His face grew stern and sad]

   WHEN on the sandy shore I sit,
      Beside the salt sea-wave,
   And fall into a weeping fit
      Because I dare not shave
   A little whisper at my ear

   And shed done up her hair in the style that
         the Empress had brought into fashion STOP I had been to the play

a ball at an Oxford Commemorationand also as a specimen of what might be
done by making the Double Acrostic _a connected poem_ instead of what it
has hitherto been, a string of disjointed stanzas, on every conceivable
subject, and about as interesting to read straight through as a page of a

subsequent stanza one of the cross lights STOP No STOP II STOP was written after seeing Miss Ellen Terry perform in the play of
Hamlet STOP In this case the first stanza describes the two main words STOP No STOP III STOP was written after seeing Miss Marion Terry perform in Mr.

   THERE was an ancient City, stricken down
      With a strange frenzy, and for many a day
   They paced from morn to eve the crowded town,
            And danced the night away STOP I asked the cause: the aged man grew sad:
      They pointed to a building gray and tall,

      We clove a pathway through a frantic throng:
   The steeds, wild-plunging, filled us with affright:
            The chariots whirled along STOP Within a marble hall a river ran
      A living tide, half muslin and half cloth:
   And here one mourned a broken wreath or fan,
            Yet swallowed down her wrath;

   And here one offered to a thirsty fair
      (His words half-drowned amid those thunders tuneful)
   Some frozen viand (there were many there),
            A tooth-ache in each spoonful STOP There comes a happy pause, for human strength

   And every one must reach the point at length

      And all is tangled talk and mazy motion
   Much like a waving field of golden grain,

      By vows, unwhispered here, yet heard above STOP And still it lives, that keen and heavenward flame,
      Lives in his eye, and trembles in his tone:

PHANTASMAGORIA STOP CANTO I STOP The Trystyng STOP One winter night, at half-past nine,
      Cold, tired, and cross, and muddy,
  I had come home, too late to dine,
  And supper, with cigars and wine,
      Was waiting in the study STOP There was a strangeness in the room,
      And Something white and wavy
  Was standing near me in the gloom--
  _I_ took it for the carpet-broom
      Left by that careless slavey STOP [Illustration]

  But presently the Thing began
      To shiver and to sneeze:
  On which I said "Come, come, my man STOP That's a most inconsiderate plan STOP Less noise there, if you please! STOP "I've caught a cold," the Thing replies,
      "Out there upon the landing. STOP I turned to look in some surprise,
  And there, before my very eyes,
      A little Ghost was standing STOP He trembled when he caught my eye,
      And got behind a chair STOP "How came you here," I said, "and why STOP I never saw a thing so shy STOP Come out STOP Don't shiver there! STOP He said "I'd gladly tell you how,
      And also tell you why;
  But" (here he gave a little bow)
  "You're in so bad a temper now,
      You'd think it all a lie STOP "And as to being in a fright,
      Allow me to remark
  That Ghosts have just as good a right,
  In every way, to fear the light,
      As Men to fear the dark. STOP "No plea," said I, "can well excuse
      Such cowardice in you:
  For Ghosts can visit when they choose,
  Whereas we Humans ca'n't refuse
      To grant the interview. STOP He said "A flutter of alarm
      Is not unnatural, is it STOP I really feared you meant some harm:
  But, now I see that you are calm,
      Let me explain my visit STOP "Houses are classed, I beg to state,
      According to the number
  Of Ghosts that they accommodate:
  (The Tenant merely counts as _weight_,
      With Coals and other lumber) STOP "This is a 'one-ghost' house, and you
      When you arrived last summer,
  May have remarked a Spectre who
  Was doing all that Ghosts can do
      To welcome the new-comer STOP "In Villas this is always done--
      However cheaply rented:
  For, though of course there's less of fun
  When there is only room for one,
      Ghosts have to be contented STOP "That Spectre left you on the Third--
      Since then you've not been haunted:
  For, as he never sent us word,
  'Twas quite by accident we heard
      That any one was wanted STOP "A Spectre has first choice, by right,
      In filling up a vacancy;
  Then Phantom, Goblin, Elf, and Sprite--
  If all these fail them, they invite
      The nicest Ghoul that they can see STOP "The Spectres said the place was low,
      And that you kept bad wine:
  So, as a Phantom had to go,
  And I was first, of course, you know,
      I couldn't well decline. STOP "No doubt," said I, "they settled who
      Was fittest to be sent:
  Yet still to choose a brat like you,
  To haunt a man of forty-two,
      Was no great compliment! STOP "I'm not so young, Sir," he replied,
      "As you might think STOP The fact is,
  In caverns by the water-side,
  And other places that I've tried,
      I've had a lot of practice:

  "But I have never taken yet
      A strict domestic part,
  And in my flurry I forget
  The Five Good Rules of Etiquette
      We have to know by heart. STOP My sympathies were warming fast
      Towards the little fellow:
  He was so utterly aghast
  At having found a Man at last,
      And looked so scared and yellow STOP [Illustration: "IN CAVERNS BY THE WATER-SIDE"]

  "At least," I said, "I'm glad to find
      A Ghost is not a _dumb_ thing STOP But pray sit down: you'll feel inclined
  (If, like myself, you have not dined)
      To take a snack of something:

  "Though, certainly, you don't appear
      A thing to offer _food_ to STOP And then I shall be glad to hear--
  If you will say them loud and clear--
      The Rules that you allude to. STOP "Thanks STOP You shall hear them by and by
      This _is_ a piece of luck! STOP "What may I offer you? STOP said I STOP "Well, since you _are_ so kind, I'll try
      A little bit of duck STOP "_One_ slice STOP And may I ask you for
      Another drop of gravy? STOP I sat and looked at him in awe,
  For certainly I never saw
      A thing so white and wavy STOP [Illustration]

  And still he seemed to grow more white,
      More vapoury, and wavier--
  Seen in the dim and flickering light,
  As he proceeded to recite
      His "Maxims of Behaviour. STOP CANTO II STOP Hys Fyve Rules STOP "My First--but don't suppose," he said,
      "I'm setting you a riddle--
  Is--if your Victim be in bed,
  Don't touch the curtains at his head,
      But take them in the middle,

  "And wave them slowly in and out,
      While drawing them asunder;
  And in a minute's time, no doubt,
  He'll raise his head and look about
      With eyes of wrath and wonder STOP "And here you must on no pretence
      Make the first observation STOP Wait for the Victim to commence:
  No Ghost of any common sense
      Begins a conversation STOP [Illustration]

  "If he should say '_How came you here?_'
      (The way that _you_ began, Sir,)
  In such a case your course is clear--
  '_On the bat's back, my little dear!_'
      Is the appropriate answer STOP "If after this he says no more,
      You'd best perhaps curtail your
  Exertions--go and shake the door,
  And then, if he begins to snore,
      You'll know the thing's a failure STOP "By day, if he should be alone--
      At home or on a walk--
  You merely give a hollow groan,
  To indicate the kind of tone
      In which you mean to talk STOP "But if you find him with his friends,
      The thing is rather harder STOP In such a case success depends
  On picking up some candle-ends,
      Or butter, in the larder STOP "With this you make a kind of slide
      (It answers best with suet),
  On which you must contrive to glide,
  And swing yourself from side to side--
      One soon learns how to do it STOP "The Second tells us what is right
      In ceremonious calls:--
  '_First burn a blue or crimson light_'
  (A thing I quite forgot to-night),
      '_Then scratch the door or walls._'"

[Illustration: "AND SWING YOURSELF FROM SIDE TO SIDE"]

  I said "You'll visit _here_ no more,
      If you attempt the Guy STOP I'll have no bonfires on _my_ floor--
  And, as for scratching at the door,
      I'd like to see you try! STOP "The Third was written to protect
      The interests of the Victim,
  And tells us, as I recollect,
  _To treat him with a grave respect,
      And not to contradict him_. STOP "That's plain," said I, "as Tare and Tret,
      To any comprehension:
  I only wish _some_ Ghosts I've met
  Would not so _constantly_ forget
      The maxim that you mention! STOP "Perhaps," he said, "_you_ first transgressed
      The laws of hospitality:
  All Ghosts instinctively detest
  The Man that fails to treat his guest
      With proper cordiality STOP [Illustration]

  "If you address a Ghost as 'Thing! STOP Or strike him with a hatchet,
  He is permitted by the King
  To drop all _formal_ parleying--
      And then you're _sure_ to catch it STOP "The Fourth prohibits trespassing
      Where other Ghosts are quartered:
  And those convicted of the thing
  (Unless when pardoned by the King)
      Must instantly be slaughtered STOP "That simply means 'be cut up small':
      Ghosts soon unite anew:
  The process scarcely hurts at all--
  Not more than when _you're_ what you call
      'Cut up' by a Review STOP "The Fifth is one you may prefer
      That I should quote entire:--
  _The King must be addressed as 'Sir. STOP This, from a simple courtier,
      Is all the Laws require_:

  "_But, should you wish to do the thing
      With out-and-out politeness,
  Accost him as 'My Goblin King! STOP And always use, in answering,
      The phrase 'Your Royal Whiteness STOP '_

  "I'm getting rather hoarse, I fear,
      After so much reciting:
  So, if you don't object, my dear,
  We'll try a glass of bitter beer--
      I think it looks inviting. STOP [Illustration]


CANTO III STOP Scarmoges STOP "And did you really walk," said I,
      "On such a wretched night STOP I always fancied Ghosts could fly--
  If not exactly in the sky,
      Yet at a fairish height. STOP "It's very well," said he, "for Kings
      To soar above the earth:
  But Phantoms often find that wings--
  Like many other pleasant things--
      Cost more than they are worth STOP "Spectres of course are rich, and so
      Can buy them from the Elves:
  But _we_ prefer to keep below--
  They're stupid company, you know STOP For any but themselves:

[Illustration]

  "For, though they claim to be exempt
      From pride, they treat a Phantom
  As something quite beneath contempt--
  Just as no Turkey ever dreamt
      Of noticing a Bantam. STOP "They seem too proud," said I, "to go
      To houses such as mine STOP Pray, how did they contrive to know
  So quickly that 'the place was low,'
      And that I 'kept bad wine'? STOP "Inspector Kobold came to you--"
      The little Ghost began STOP Here I broke in--"Inspector who STOP Inspecting Ghosts is something new STOP Explain yourself my man! STOP "His name is Kobold," said my guest:
      "One of the Spectre order:
  You'll very often see him dressed
  In a yellow gown, a crimson vest,
      And a night-cap with a border STOP "He tried the Brocken business first,
      But caught a sort of chill;
  So came to England to be nursed,
  And here it took the form of _thirst_,
      Which he complains of still STOP [Illustration: "AND HERE IT TOOK THE FORM OF _THIRST_"]

  "Port-wine, he says, when rich and sound,
      Warms his old bones like nectar:
  And as the inns, where it is found,
  Are his especial hunting-ground,
      We call him the _Inn-Spectre_. STOP I bore it--bore it like a man--
      This agonizing witticism STOP And nothing could be sweeter than
  My temper, till the Ghost began
      Some most provoking criticism STOP "Cooks need not be indulged in waste;
      Yet still you'd better teach them
  Dishes should have _some sort_ of taste STOP Pray, why are all the cruets placed
      Where nobody can reach them STOP "That man of yours will never earn
      His living as a waiter STOP Is that queer _thing_ supposed to burn STOP (It's far too dismal a concern
      To call a Moderator) STOP "The duck was tender, but the peas
      Were very much too old:
  And just remember, if you please,
  The _next_ time you have toasted cheese,
      Don't let them send it cold STOP "You'd find the bread improved, I think,
      By getting better flour:
  And have you anything to drink
  That looks a _little_ less like ink,
      And isn't _quite_ so sour? STOP Then, peering round with curious eyes,
      He muttered "Goodness gracious! STOP And so went on to criticise--
  "Your room's an inconvenient size:
      It's neither snug nor spacious STOP "That narrow window, I expect,
      Serves but to let the dusk in--"
  "But please," said I, "to recollect
  'Twas fashioned by an architect
      Who pinned his faith on Ruskin! STOP "I don't care who he was, Sir, or
      On whom he pinned his faith STOP Constructed by whatever law,
  So poor a job I never saw,
      As I'm a living Wraith STOP "What a re-markable cigar STOP How much are they a dozen? STOP I growled "No matter what they are STOP You're getting as familiar
      As if you were my cousin STOP "Now that's a thing _I will not stand_,
      And so I tell you flat. STOP "Aha," said he, "we're getting grand! STOP (Taking a bottle in his hand)
      "I'll soon arrange for _that_! STOP And here he took a careful aim,
      And gaily cried "Here goes! STOP I tried to dodge it as it came,
  But somehow caught it, all the same,
      Exactly on my nose STOP And I remember nothing more
      That I can clearly fix,
  Till I was sitting on the floor,
  Repeating "Two and five are four,
      But _five and two_ are six. STOP What really passed I never learned,
      Nor guessed: I only know
  That, when at last my sense returned,
  The lamp, neglected, dimly burned--
      The fire was getting low--

  Through driving mists I seemed to see
      A Thing that smirked and smiled:
  And found that he was giving me
  A lesson in Biography,
      As if I were a child STOP [Illustration]


CANTO IV STOP Hys Nouryture STOP "Oh, when I was a little Ghost,
      A merry time had we STOP Each seated on his favourite post,
  We chumped and chawed the buttered toast
      They gave us for our tea. STOP "That story is in print! STOP I cried STOP "Don't say it's not, because
  It's known as well as Bradshaw's Guide! STOP (The Ghost uneasily replied
      He hardly thought it was) STOP "It's not in Nursery Rhymes STOP And yet
      I almost think it is--
  'Three little Ghosteses' were set
  'On posteses,' you know, and ate
      Their 'buttered toasteses. STOP "I have the book; so, if you doubt it--"
      I turned to search the shelf STOP "Don't stir! STOP he cried STOP "We'll do without it;
  I now remember all about it;
      I wrote the thing myself STOP "It came out in a 'Monthly,' or
      At least my agent said it did:
  Some literary swell, who saw
  It, thought it seemed adapted for
      The Magazine he edited STOP "My father was a Brownie, Sir;
      My mother was a Fairy STOP The notion had occurred to her,
  The children would be happier,
      If they were taught to vary STOP "The notion soon became a craze;
      And, when it once began, she
  Brought us all out in different ways--
  One was a Pixy, two were Fays,
      Another was a Banshee;

  "The Fetch and Kelpie went to school,
      And gave a lot of trouble;
  Next came a Poltergeist and Ghoul,
  And then two Trolls (which broke the rule),
      A Goblin, and a Double--

  "(If that's a snuff-box on the shelf,"
      He added with a yawn,
  "I'll take a pinch)--next came an Elf,
  And then a Phantom (that's myself),
      And last, a Leprechaun STOP "One day, some Spectres chanced to call,
      Dressed in the usual white:
  I stood and watched them in the hall,
  And couldn't make them out at all,
      They seemed so strange a sight STOP [Illustration]

  "I wondered what on earth they were,
      That looked all head and sack;
  But Mother told me not to stare,
  And then she twitched me by the hair,
      And punched me in the back STOP "Since then I've often wished that I
      Had been a Spectre born STOP But what's the use? STOP (He heaved a sigh) STOP "_They_ are the ghost-nobility,
      And look on _us_ with scorn STOP "My phantom-life was soon begun:
      When I was barely six,
  I went out with an older one--
  And just at first I thought it fun,
      And learned a lot of tricks STOP "I've haunted dungeons, castles, towers--
      Wherever I was sent:
  I've often sat and howled for hours,
  Drenched to the skin with driving showers,
      Upon a battlement STOP "It's quite old-fashioned now to groan
      When you begin to speak:
  This is the newest thing in tone--"
  And here (it chilled me to the bone)
      He gave an _awful_ squeak STOP "Perhaps," he added, "to _your_ ear
      That sounds an easy thing STOP Try it yourself, my little dear STOP It took _me_ something like a year,
      With constant practising STOP "And when you've learned to squeak, my man
      And caught the double sob,
  You're pretty much where you began:
  Just try and gibber if you can STOP That's something _like_ a job STOP "_I've_ tried it, and can only say
      I'm sure you couldn't do it, e-
  ven if you practised night and day,
  Unless you have a turn that way,
      And natural ingenuity STOP "Shakspeare I think it is who treats
      Of Ghosts, in days of old,
  Who 'gibbered in the Roman streets,'
  Dressed, if you recollect, in sheets--
      They must have found it cold STOP "I've often spent ten pounds on stuff,
      In dressing as a Double;
  But, though it answers as a puff,
  It never has effect enough
      To make it worth the trouble STOP "Long bills soon quenched the little thirst
      I had for being funny STOP The setting-up is always worst:
  Such heaps of things you want at first,
      One must be made of money STOP [Illustration]

  "For instance, take a Haunted Tower,
      With skull, cross-bones, and sheet;
  Blue lights to burn (say) two an hour,
  Condensing lens of extra power,
      And set of chains complete:

  "What with the things you have to hire--
      The fitting on the robe--
  And testing all the coloured fire--
  The outfit of itself would tire
      The patience of a Job STOP "And then they're so fastidious,
      The Haunted-House Committee:
  I've often known them make a fuss
  Because a Ghost was French, or Russ,
      Or even from the City STOP "Some dialects are objected to--
      For one, the _Irish_ brogue is:
  And then, for all you have to do,
  One pound a week they offer you,
      And find yourself in Bogies! STOP CANTO V.

Byckerment STOP "Don't they consult the 'Victims,' though? STOP I said STOP "They should, by rights,
  Give them a chance--because, you know,
  The tastes of people differ so,
      Especially in Sprites. STOP The Phantom shook his head and smiled STOP "Consult them STOP Not a bit STOP 'Twould be a job to drive one wild,
  To satisfy one single child--
      There'd be no end to it! STOP "Of course you can't leave _children_ free,"
      Said I, "to pick and choose:
  But, in the case of men like me,
  I think 'Mine Host' might fairly be
      Allowed to state his views. STOP He said "It really wouldn't pay--
      Folk are so full of fancies STOP We visit for a single day,
  And whether then we go, or stay,
      Depends on circumstances STOP "And, though we don't consult 'Mine Host'
      Before the thing's arranged,
  Still, if he often quits his post,
  Or is not a well-mannered Ghost,
      Then you can have him changed STOP "But if the host's a man like you--
      I mean a man of sense;
  And if the house is not too new--"
  "Why, what has _that_," said I, "to do
      With Ghost's convenience? STOP "A new house does not suit, you know--
      It's such a job to trim it:
  But, after twenty years or so,
  The wainscotings begin to go,
      So twenty is the limit. STOP "To trim" was not a phrase I could
      Remember having heard:
  "Perhaps," I said, "you'll be so good
  As tell me what is understood
      Exactly by that word? STOP [Illustration]

  "It means the loosening all the doors,"
      The Ghost replied, and laughed:
  "It means the drilling holes by scores
  In all the skirting-boards and floors,
      To make a thorough draught STOP "You'll sometimes find that one or two
      Are all you really need
  To let the wind come whistling through--
  But _here_ there'll be a lot to do! STOP I faintly gasped "Indeed STOP "If I'd been rather later, I'll
      Be bound," I added, trying
  (Most unsuccessfully) to smile,
  "You'd have been busy all this while,
      Trimming and beautifying? STOP "Why, no," said he; "perhaps I should
      Have stayed another minute--
  But still no Ghost, that's any good,
  Without an introduction would
      Have ventured to begin it STOP "The proper thing, as you were late,
      Was certainly to go:
  But, with the roads in such a state,
  I got the Knight-Mayor's leave to wait
      For half an hour or so. STOP "Who's the Knight-Mayor? STOP I cried STOP Instead
      Of answering my question,
  "Well STOP If you don't know _that_," he said,
  "Either you never go to bed,
      Or you've a grand digestion STOP "He goes about and sits on folk
      That eat too much at night:
  His duties are to pinch, and poke,
  And squeeze them till they nearly choke. STOP (I said "It serves them right!" STOP "And folk that sup on things like these--"
      He muttered, "eggs and bacon--
  Lobster--and duck--and toasted cheese--
  If they don't get an awful squeeze,
      I'm very much mistaken STOP "He is immensely fat, and so
      Well suits the occupation:
  In point of fact, if you must know,
  We used to call him, years ago,
      _The Mayor and Corporation_ STOP [Illustration: "HE GOES ABOUT AND SITS ON FOLK"]

  "The day he was elected Mayor
      I _know_ that every Sprite meant
  To vote for _me_, but did not dare--
  He was so frantic with despair
      And furious with excitement STOP [Illustration]

  "When it was over, for a whim,
      He ran to tell the King;
  And being the reverse of slim,
  A two-mile trot was not for him
      A very easy thing STOP "So, to reward him for his run
      (As it was baking hot,
  And he was over twenty stone),
  The King proceeded, half in fun,
      To knight him on the spot. STOP "'Twas a great liberty to take! STOP (I fired up like a rocket) STOP "He did it just for punning's sake:
  'The man,' says Johnson, 'that would make
      A pun, would pick a pocket!' STOP "A man," said he, "is not a King. STOP I argued for a while,
  And did my best to prove the thing--
  The Phantom merely listening
      With a contemptuous smile STOP At last, when, breath and patience spent,
      I had recourse to smoking--
  "Your _aim_," he said, "is excellent:
  But--when you call it _argument_--
      Of course you're only joking? STOP [Illustration]

  Stung by his cold and snaky eye,
      I roused myself at length
  To say "At least I do defy
  The veriest sceptic to deny
      That union is strength! STOP "That's true enough," said he, "yet stay--"
      I listened in all meekness--
  "_Union_ is strength, I'm bound to say;
  In fact, the thing's as clear as day;
      But _onions_--are a weakness. STOP CANTO VI STOP Dyscomfyture STOP As one who strives a hill to climb,
      Who never climbed before:
  Who finds it, in a little time,
  Grow every moment less sublime,
      And votes the thing a bore:

  Yet, having once begun to try,
      Dares not desert his quest,
  But, climbing, ever keeps his eye
  On one small hut against the sky,
      Wherein he hopes to rest:

  Who climbs till nerve and force are spent,
      With many a puff and pant:
  Who still, as rises the ascent,
  In language grows more violent,
      Although in breath more scant:

[Illustration]

  Who, climbing, gains at length the place
      That crowns the upward track;
  And, entering with unsteady pace,
  Receives a buffet in the face
      That lands him on his back:

  And feels himself, like one in sleep,
      Glide swiftly down again,
  A helpless weight, from steep to steep,
  Till, with a headlong giddy sweep,
      He drops upon the plain--

  So I, that had resolved to bring
      Conviction to a ghost,
  And found it quite a different thing
  From any human arguing,
      Yet dared not quit my post

  But, keeping still the end in view
      To which I hoped to come,
  I strove to prove the matter true
  By putting everything I knew
      Into an axiom:

  Commencing every single phrase
      With 'therefore' or 'because,'
  I blindly reeled, a hundred ways,
  About the syllogistic maze,
      Unconscious where I was STOP Quoth he "That's regular clap-trap:
      Don't bluster any more STOP Now _do_ be cool and take a nap STOP Such a ridiculous old chap
      Was never seen before STOP "You're like a man I used to meet,
      Who got one day so furious
  In arguing, the simple heat
  Scorched both his slippers off his feet! STOP I said "_That's very curious!_"

[Illustration: "SCORCHED BOTH HIS SLIPPERS OFF HIS FEET"]

  "Well, it _is_ curious, I agree,
      And sounds perhaps like fibs:
  But still it's true as true can be--
  As sure as your name's Tibbs," said he STOP I said "My name's _not_ Tibbs. STOP "_Not_ Tibbs! STOP he cried--his tone became
      A shade or two less hearty--
  "Why, no," said I STOP "My proper name
  Is Tibbets--" "Tibbets? STOP "Aye, the same. STOP "Why, then YOU'RE NOT THE PARTY! STOP With that he struck the board a blow
      That shivered half the glasses STOP "Why couldn't you have told me so
  Three quarters of an hour ago,
      You prince of all the asses STOP "To walk four miles through mud and rain,
      To spend the night in smoking,
  And then to find that it's in vain--
  And I've to do it all again--
      It's really _too_ provoking STOP [Illustration]

  "Don't talk! STOP he cried, as I began
      To mutter some excuse STOP "Who can have patience with a man

      An idiotic goose STOP "To keep me waiting here, instead
      Of telling me at once

      On _me_ in such a fashion STOP Why didn't you enquire my name

      I let the matter drop STOP "Good-night, old Turnip-top, good-night STOP When I am gone, perhaps
  They'll send you some inferior Sprite,

      Then, if he leers and chuckles,
  You just be handy with a stick

      Of such-like goings-on--

CANTO VII STOP Sad Souvenaunce STOP [Illustration]

  "What's this? STOP I pondered STOP "Have I slept STOP Or can I have been drinking? STOP But soon a gentler feeling crept
  Upon me, and I sat and wept
      An hour or so, like winking STOP "No need for Bones to hurry so! STOP I sobbed STOP "In fact, I doubt
  If it was worth his while to go--
  And who is Tibbs, I'd like to know,
      To make such work about STOP "If Tibbs is anything like me,
      It's _possible_," I said,
  "He won't be over-pleased to be
  Dropped in upon at half-past three,
      After he's snug in bed STOP "And if Bones plagues him anyhow--
      Squeaking and all the rest of it,
  As he was doing here just now--
  _I_ prophesy there'll be a row,
      And Tibbs will have the best of it! STOP Then, as my tears could never bring
      The friendly Phantom back,
  It seemed to me the proper thing
  To mix another glass, and sing
      The following Coronach STOP [Illustration: "AND TIBBS WILL HAVE THE BEST OF IT"]

  '_And art thou gone, beloved Ghost STOP Best of Familiars STOP Nay then, farewell, my duckling roast,
  Farewell, farewell, my tea and toast,
      My meerschaum and cigars!_

  '_The hues of life are dull and gray,
      The sweets of life insipid,
  When thou, my charmer, art away--
  Old Brick, or rather, let me say,
      Old Parallelepiped!_'

  Instead of singing Verse the Third,
      I ceased--abruptly, rather:
  But, after such a splendid word,
  I felt that it would be absurd
      To try it any farther STOP So with a yawn I went my way
      To seek the welcome downy,
  And slept, and dreamed till break of day
  Of Poltergeist and Fetch and Fay
      And Leprechaun and Brownie STOP For years I've not been visited
      By any kind of Sprite;
  Yet still they echo in my head,
  Those parting words, so kindly said,

  That I hate, but the thing that I hate the most

    Ugly I'm sure you'll allow it to be:
  Suppose it extended a mile or more,

HIAWATHA'S PHOTOGRAPHING STOP [In an age of imitation, I can claim no special merit for this slight
attempt at doing what is known to be so easy STOP Any fairly practised writer,
with the slightest ear for rhythm, could compose, for hours together, in
the easy running metre of 'The Song of Hiawatha. STOP Having, then, distinctly
stated that I challenge no attention in the following little poem to its
merely verbal jingle, I must beg the candid reader to confine his
criticism to its treatment of the subject. STOP From his shoulder Hiawatha
  Took the camera of rosewood,
  Made of sliding, folding rosewood;
  Neatly put it all together STOP In its case it lay compactly,
  Folded into nearly nothing;
  But he opened out the hinges,
  Pushed and pulled the joints and hinges,
  Till it looked all squares and oblongs,
  Like a complicated figure
  In the Second Book of Euclid STOP [Illustration]

    This he perched upon a tripod--
  Crouched beneath its dusky cover--
  Stretched his hand, enforcing silence--
  Said "Be motionless, I beg you! STOP Mystic, awful was the process STOP All the family in order
  Sat before him for their pictures:
  Each in turn, as he was taken,
  Volunteered his own suggestions,
  His ingenious suggestions STOP First the Governor, the Father:
  He suggested velvet curtains
  Looped about a massy pillar;
  And the corner of a table,
  Of a rosewood dining-table STOP He would hold a scroll of something,
  Hold it firmly in his left-hand;
  He would keep his right-hand buried
  (Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat;
  He would contemplate the distance
  With a look of pensive meaning,
  As of ducks that die in tempests STOP Grand, heroic was the notion:
  Yet the picture failed entirely:
  Failed, because he moved a little,
  Moved, because he couldn't help it STOP Next, his better half took courage;
  She would have her picture taken STOP _She_ came dressed beyond description,
  Dressed in jewels and in satin
  Far too gorgeous for an empress STOP [Illustration: "FIRST THE GOVERNOR, THE FATHER"]

  Gracefully she sat down sideways,
  With a simper scarcely human,
  Holding in her hand a bouquet
  Rather larger than a cabbage STOP All the while that she was sitting,
  Still the lady chattered, chattered,
  Like a monkey in the forest STOP "Am I sitting still? STOP she asked him STOP "Is my face enough in profile STOP Shall I hold the bouquet higher STOP Will it come into the picture? STOP And the picture failed completely STOP Next the Son, the Stunning-Cantab:
  He suggested curves of beauty,
  Curves pervading all his figure,
  Which the eye might follow onward,
  Till they centered in the breast-pin,
  Centered in the golden breast-pin STOP He had learnt it all from Ruskin
  (Author of 'The Stones of Venice,'
  'Seven Lamps of Architecture,'
  'Modern Painters,' and some others);
  And perhaps he had not fully
  Understood his author's meaning;
  But, whatever was the reason,
  All was fruitless, as the picture
  Ended in an utter failure STOP [Illustration: "NEXT THE SON, THE STUNNING-CANTAB"]

    Next to him the eldest daughter:
  She suggested very little,
  Only asked if he would take her
  With her look of 'passive beauty. STOP Her idea of passive beauty
  Was a squinting of the left-eye,
  Was a drooping of the right-eye,
  Was a smile that went up sideways
  To the corner of the nostrils STOP Hiawatha, when she asked him,
  Took no notice of the question,
  Looked as if he hadn't heard it;
  But, when pointedly appealed to,
  Smiled in his peculiar manner,
  Coughed and said it 'didn't matter,'
  Bit his lip and changed the subject STOP Nor in this was he mistaken,
  As the picture failed completely STOP So in turn the other sisters STOP [Illustration: "NEXT TO HIM THE ELDEST DAUGHTER"]

    Last, the youngest son was taken:
  Very rough and thick his hair was,
  Very round and red his face was,
  Very dusty was his jacket,
  Very fidgety his manner STOP And his overbearing sisters
  Called him names he disapproved of:
  Called him Johnny, 'Daddy's Darling,'
  Called him Jacky, 'Scrubby School-boy. STOP And, so awful was the picture,
  In comparison the others
  Seemed, to one's bewildered fancy,
  To have partially succeeded STOP Finally my Hiawatha
  Tumbled all the tribe together,
  ('Grouped' is not the right expression),
  And, as happy chance would have it,
  Did at last obtain a picture
  Where the faces all succeeded:
  Each came out a perfect likeness STOP [Illustration: "LAST, THE YOUNGEST SON WAS TAKEN"]

    Then they joined and all abused it,
  Unrestrainedly abused it,
  As the worst and ugliest picture
  They could possibly have dreamed of STOP Giving one such strange expressions--
  Sullen, stupid, pert expressions STOP Really any one would take us
  (Any one that did not know us)
  For the most unpleasant people! STOP (Hiawatha seemed to think so,
  Seemed to think it not unlikely) STOP All together rang their voices,
  Angry, loud, discordant voices,
  As of dogs that howl in concert,
  As of cats that wail in chorus STOP But my Hiawatha's patience,
  His politeness and his patience,
  Unaccountably had vanished,
  And he left that happy party STOP Neither did he leave them slowly,
  With the calm deliberation,
  The intense deliberation
  Of a photographic artist:
  But he left them in a hurry,
  Left them in a mighty hurry,
  Stating that he would not stand it,
  Stating in emphatic language
  What he'd be before he'd stand it STOP Hurriedly he packed his boxes:
  Hurriedly the porter trundled
  On a barrow all his boxes:
  Hurriedly he took his ticket:
  Hurriedly the train received him:
  Thus departed Hiawatha STOP [Illustration]




MELANCHOLETTA STOP With saddest music all day long
    She soothed her secret sorrow:
  At night she sighed "I fear 'twas wrong
    Such cheerful words to borrow STOP Dearest, a sweeter, sadder song
    I'll sing to thee to-morrow. STOP I thanked her, but I could not say
    That I was glad to hear it:
  I left the house at break of day,
    And did not venture near it
  Till time, I hoped, had worn away

    (Excuse the slang expression)
  To Sadler's Wells to see the play,
    In hopes the new impression
  Might in her thoughts, from grave to gay
    Effect some slight digression STOP I asked three gay young dogs from town
    To join us in our folly,
  Whose mirth, I thought, might serve to drown
    My sister's melancholy:
  The lively Jones, the sportive Brown,
    And Robinson the jolly STOP The maid announced the meal in tones
    That I myself had taught her,
  Meant to allay my sister's moans
    Like oil on troubled water:
  I rushed to Jones, the lively Jones,
    And begged him to escort her STOP Vainly he strove, with ready wit,
    To joke about the weather--
  To ventilate the last '_on dit_'--
    To quote the price of leather--
  She groaned "Here I and Sorrow sit:
    Let us lament together! STOP I urged "You're wasting time, you know:
    Delay will spoil the venison. STOP "My heart is wasted with my woe STOP There is no rest--in Venice, on
  The Bridge of Sighs! STOP she quoted low
    From Byron and from Tennyson STOP I need not tell of soup and fish
    In solemn silence swallowed,
  The sobs that ushered in each dish,
    And its departure followed,
  Nor yet my suicidal wish
    To _be_ the cheese I hollowed STOP Some desperate attempts were made
    To start a conversation;
  "Madam," the sportive Brown essayed,
    "Which kind of recreation,
  Hunting or fishing, have you made
    Your special occupation? STOP Her lips curved downwards instantly,
    As if of india-rubber STOP "Hounds _in full cry_ I like," said she:
    (Oh how I longed to snub her! STOP "Of fish, a whale's the one for me,
    _It is so full of blubber_! STOP The night's performance was "King John. STOP "It's dull," she wept, "and so-so! STOP A while I let her tears flow on,
    She said they soothed her woe so STOP At length the curtain rose upon
    'Bombastes Furioso. STOP In vain we roared; in vain we tried
    To rouse her into laughter:
  Her pensive glances wandered wide
    From orchestra to rafter--
  "_Tier upon tier!_" she said, and sighed;
    And silence followed after STOP [Illustration]




A VALENTINE STOP [Sent to a friend who had complained that I was glad enough to see him
when he came, but didn't seem to miss him if he stayed away. STOP And cannot pleasures, while they last,
  Be actual unless, when past,
  They leave us shuddering and aghast,
          With anguish smarting STOP And cannot friends be firm and fast,
          And yet bear parting STOP And must I then, at Friendship's call,
  Calmly resign the little all
  (Trifling, I grant, it is and small)
          I have of gladness,
  And lend my being to the thrall
          Of gloom and sadness STOP And think you that I should be dumb,
  And full _dolorum omnium_,
  Excepting when _you_ choose to come
          And share my dinner STOP At other times be sour and glum

  His fair one be denied his gaze,
  Sinks not in grief and wild amaze,
          But, wiser wooer,
  He spends the time in writing lays,
          And posts them to her STOP And if the verse flow free and fast,
  Till even the poet is aghast,
  A touching Valentine at last
          The post shall carry,
  When thirteen days are gone and past
          Of February STOP Farewell, dear friend, and when we meet,
  In desert waste or crowded street,

  He trilled a carol fresh and free:
  He laughed aloud for very glee:
  There came a breeze from off the sea:

  It passed athwart the glooming flat--
  It fanned his forehead as he sat--
  It lightly bore away his hat,

  All to the feet of one who stood
  Like maid enchanted in a wood,
  Frowning as darkly as she could STOP With huge umbrella, lank and brown,
  Unerringly she pinned it down,
  Right through the centre of the crown STOP Then, with an aspect cold and grim,
  Regardless of its battered rim,
  She took it up and gave it him STOP A while like one in dreams he stood,
  Then faltered forth his gratitude
  In words just short of being rude:

  For it had lost its shape and shine,
  And it had cost him four-and-nine,
  And he was going out to dine STOP [Illustration: "UNERRINGLY SHE PINNED IT DOWN." STOP "To dine! STOP she sneered in acid tone STOP "To bend thy being to a bone

  Moaned "This is harder than Bezique! STOP But when she asked him "Wherefore so? STOP He felt his very whiskers glow,
  And frankly owned "I do not know. STOP [Illustration: "THIS IS HARDER THAN BEZIQUE!" STOP While, like broad waves of golden grain,

  His colour came and went again STOP Pitying his obvious distress,
  Yet with a tinge of bitterness,
  She said "The More exceeds the Less. STOP "A truth of such undoubted weight,"
  He urged, "and so extreme in date,

  In tone of cold malignity:
  "To others, yea: but not to thee. STOP But when she saw him quail and quake,
  And when he urged "For pity's sake! STOP Once more in gentle tone she spake STOP "Thought in the mind doth still abide:
  That is by Intellect supplied,
  And within that Idea doth hide:

  "And he, that yearns the truth to know,
  Still further inwardly may go,
  And find Idea from Notion flow:

  "And thus the chain, that sages sought,
  Is to a glorious circle wrought,
  For Notion hath its source in Thought. STOP So passed they on with even pace:
  Yet gradually one might trace
  A shadow growing on his face STOP [Illustration]


The Second Voice STOP [Illustration]

  They walked beside the wave-worn beach;
  Her tongue was very apt to teach,
  And now and then he did beseech

  She would abate her dulcet tone,
  Because the talk was all her own,
  And he was dull as any drone STOP She urged "No cheese is made of chalk":
  And ceaseless flowed her dreary talk,
  Tuned to the footfall of a walk STOP Her voice was very full and rich,
  And, when at length she asked him "Which? STOP It mounted to its highest pitch STOP He a bewildered answer gave,
  Drowned in the sullen moaning wave,
  Lost in the echoes of the cave STOP He answered her he knew not what:
  Like shaft from bow at random shot,
  He spoke, but she regarded not STOP She waited not for his reply,
  But with a downward leaden eye
  Went on as if he were not by:

  Sound argument and grave defence,
  Strange questions raised on "Why? STOP and "Whence? STOP And wildly tangled evidence STOP When he, with racked and whirling brain,
  Feebly implored her to explain,
  She simply said it all again STOP Wrenched with an agony intense,
  He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense,
  And careless of all consequence:

  "Mind--I believe--is Essence--Ent--
  Abstract--that is--an Accident--
  Which we--that is to say--I meant--"

  When, with quick breath and cheeks all flushed,
  At length his speech was somewhat hushed,
  She looked at him, and he was crushed STOP It needed not her calm reply:
  She fixed him with a stony eye,
  And he could neither fight nor fly,

  While she dissected, word by word,
  His speech, half guessed at and half heard,
  As might a cat a little bird STOP [Illustration: "HE SPAKE, NEGLECTING SOUND AND SENSE." STOP Then, having wholly overthrown
  His views, and stripped them to the bone,
  Proceeded to unfold her own STOP "Shall Man be Man STOP And shall he miss

  The darkness toppling from the height,
  The feathery train of granite Night STOP "Shall he, grown gray among his peers,
  Through the thick curtain of his tears
  Catch glimpses of his earlier years,

  Old shufflings on the sanded floor,
  Old knuckles tapping at the door STOP "Yet still before him as he flies

  And savage rapture, like a tooth
  She wrenched some slow reluctant truth STOP Till, like a silent water-mill,
  When summer suns have dried the rill,
  She reached a full stop, and was still STOP Dead calm succeeded to the fuss,
  As when the loaded omnibus
  Has reached the railway terminus:

  When, for the tumult of the street,
  Is heard the engine's stifled beat,
  The velvet tread of porters' feet STOP With glance that ever sought the ground,
  She moved her lips without a sound,
  And every now and then she frowned STOP He gazed upon the sleeping sea,
  And joyed in its tranquillity,
  And in that silence dead, but she

  To muse a little space did seem,
  Then, like the echo of a dream,
  Harped back upon her threadbare theme STOP Still an attentive ear he lent
  But could not fathom what she meant:
  She was not deep, nor eloquent STOP He marked the ripple on the sand:
  The even swaying of her hand
  Was all that he could understand STOP He saw in dreams a drawing-room,
  Where thirteen wretches sat in gloom,
  Waiting--he thought he knew for whom:

  He saw them drooping here and there,
  Each feebly huddled on a chair,
  In attitudes of blank despair:

  Oysters were not more mute than they,
  For all their brains were pumped away,
  And they had nothing more to say--

  Save one, who groaned "Three hours are gone! STOP Who shrieked "We'll wait no longer, John STOP Tell them to set the dinner on! STOP The vision passed: the ghosts were fled:
  He saw once more that woman dread:
  He heard once more the words she said STOP He left her, and he turned aside:
  He sat and watched the coming tide
  Across the shores so newly dried STOP [Illustration: "HE SAT AND WATCHED THE COMING TIDE"]

  He wondered at the waters clear,
  The breeze that whispered in his ear,
  The billows heaving far and near,

  And why he had so long preferred
  To hang upon her every word:
  "In truth," he said, "it was absurd. STOP [Illustration]


The Third Voice STOP [Illustration]

  Not long this transport held its place:
  Within a little moment's space
  Quick tears were raining down his face STOP His heart stood still, aghast with fear;
  A wordless voice, nor far nor near,
  He seemed to hear and not to hear STOP "Tears kindle not the doubtful spark STOP If so, why not STOP Of this remark
  The bearings are profoundly dark. STOP "Her speech," he said, "hath caused this pain STOP Easier I count it to explain
  The jargon of the howling main,

  "Or, stretched beside some babbling brook,
  To con, with inexpressive look,
  An unintelligible book. STOP Low spake the voice within his head,
  In words imagined more than said,
  Soundless as ghost's intended tread:

  "If thou art duller than before,
  Why quittedst thou the voice of lore STOP Why not endure, expecting more? STOP "Rather than that," he groaned aghast,
  "I'd writhe in depths of cavern vast,
  Some loathly vampire's rich repast. STOP [Illustration: "HE GROANED AGHAST"]

  "'Twere hard," it answered, "themes immense

  And most unpleasantly severe;
  Her epithets were very queer STOP "And yet, so grand were her replies,
  I could not choose but deem her wise;
  I did not dare to criticise;

  "Nor did I leave her, till she went
  So deep in tangled argument
  That all my powers of thought were spent. STOP A little whisper inly slid,
  "Yet truth is truth: you know you did. STOP A little wink beneath the lid STOP And, sickened with excess of dread,
  Prone to the dust he bent his head,
  And lay like one three-quarters dead STOP The whisper left him--like a breeze
  Lost in the depths of leafy trees--
  Left him by no means at his ease STOP Once more he weltered in despair,
  With hands, through denser-matted hair,
  More tightly clenched than then they were STOP When, bathed in Dawn of living red,
  Majestic frowned the mountain head,
  "Tell me my fault," was all he said STOP When, at high Noon, the blazing sky
  Scorched in his head each haggard eye,
  Then keenest rose his weary cry STOP And when at Eve the unpitying sun
  Smiled grimly on the solemn fun,
  "Alack," he sighed, "what _have_ I done? STOP [Illustration: "TORTURED, UNAIDED, AND ALONE"]

  But saddest, darkest was the sight,
  When the cold grasp of leaden Night
  Dashed him to earth, and held him tight STOP Tortured, unaided, and alone,
  Thunders were silence to his groan,
  Bagpipes sweet music to its tone:

  "What STOP Ever thus, in dismal round,

  Like echoed flow of silent stream,
  Or shadow of forgotten dream,

  The whisper trembling in the wind:
  "Her fate with thine was intertwined,"
  So spake it in his inner mind:

THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK,

An Agony in Eight Fits STOP PREFACE STOP If--and the thing is wildly possible--the charge of writing nonsense were
ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem, it
would be based, I feel convinced, on the line (in p. 144)

  "Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:"

In view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal
indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of such a
deed: I will not (as I might) point to the strong moral purpose of this
poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in
it, or to its noble teachings in Natural History--I will take the more
prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened STOP The Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used to
have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished; and it
more than once happened, when the time came for replacing it, that no one
on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to STOP They knew it
was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman about it--he would
only refer to his Naval Code, and read out in pathetic tones Admiralty
Instructions which none of them had ever been able to understand--so it
generally ended in its being fastened on, anyhow, across the rudder STOP The
helmsman[1] used to stand by with tears in his eyes: _he_ knew it was all
wrong, but alas STOP Rule 42 of the Code, "_No one shall speak to the Man at
the Helm_," had been completed by the Bellman himself with the words "_and
the Man at the Helm shall speak to no one_. STOP So remonstrance was
impossible, and no steering could be done till the next varnishing day STOP During these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards STOP As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock,
let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been
asked me, how to pronounce "slithy toves. STOP The "i" in "slithy" is long, as
in "writhe"; and "toves" is pronounced so as to rhyme with "groves. STOP Again, the first "o" in "borogoves" is pronounced like the "o" in
"borrow. STOP I have heard people try to give it the sound of the "o" in
"worry. STOP Such is Human Perversity STOP [1] This office was usually undertaken by the Boots, who found in it
     a refuge from the Baker's constant complaints about the insufficient
     blacking of his three pair of boots STOP This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in that
poem STOP Humpty-Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word like a
portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all STOP For instance, take the two words "fuming" and "furious. STOP Make up your mind
that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will say
first STOP Now open your mouth and speak STOP If your thoughts incline ever so
little towards "fuming," you will say "fuming-furious"; if they turn, by
even a hair's breadth towards "furious," you will say "furious-fuming";
but if you have that rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will
say "frumious. STOP Supposing that, when Pistol uttered the well-known words--

  "Under which king, Bezonian STOP Speak or die! STOP Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or Richard,
but had not been able to settle which, so that he could not possibly say
either name before the other, can it be doubted that, rather than die, he
would have gasped out "Rilchiam! STOP Fit the First STOP _THE LANDING._

  "Just the place for a Snark! STOP the Bellman cried,
    As he landed his crew with care;
  Supporting each man on the top of the tide
    By a finger entwined in his hair STOP "Just the place for a Snark STOP I have said it twice:
    That alone should encourage the crew STOP Just the place for a Snark STOP I have said it thrice:
    What I tell you three times is true. STOP The crew was complete: it included a Boots--
    A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--
  A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes--
    And a Broker, to value their goods STOP [Illustration: "SUPPORTING EACH MAN ON THE TOP OF THE TIDE"]

  A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,
    Might perhaps have won more than his share--
  But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,
    Had the whole of their cash in his care STOP There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,
    Or would sit making lace in the bow:
  And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,
    Though none of the sailors knew how STOP There was one who was famed for the number of things
    He forgot when he entered the ship:
  His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,
    And the clothes he had bought for the trip STOP He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,
    With his name painted clearly on each:
  But since he omitted to mention the fact,
    They were all left behind on the beach STOP The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because
    He had seven coats on when he came,
  With three pair of boots--but the worst of it was
    He had wholly forgotten his name STOP [Illustration: "HE HAD WHOLLY FORGOTTEN HIS NAME"]

  He would answer to "Hi! STOP or to any loud cry,
    Such as "Fry me! STOP or "Fritter my wig! STOP To "What-you-may-call-um! STOP or "What-was-his-name! STOP But especially "Thing-um-a jig! STOP While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,
    He had different names from these:
  His intimate friends called him "Candle-ends,"
    And his enemies "Toasted-cheese. STOP "His form is ungainly--his intellect small--"
    (So the Bellman would often remark)--
  "But his courage is perfect STOP And that, after all,
    Is the thing that one needs with a Snark. STOP He would joke with hyaenas, returning their stare
    With an impudent wag of the head:
  And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,
    "Just to keep up its spirits," he said STOP He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late--
    And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--
  He could only bake Bride-cake--for which, I may state,
    No materials were to be had STOP The last of the crew needs especial remark,
    Though he looked an incredible dunce:
  He had just one idea--but, that one being "Snark,"
    The good Bellman engaged him at once STOP He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,
    When the ship had been sailing a week,
  He could only kill Beavers STOP The Bellman looked scared,
    And was almost too frightened to speak:

  But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,
    There was only one Beaver on board;
  And that was a tame one he had of his own,
    Whose death would be deeply deplored STOP The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,
    Protested, with tears in its eyes,
  That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark
    Could atone for that dismal surprise STOP It strongly advised that the Butcher should be
    Conveyed in a separate ship:
  But the Bellman declared that would never agree
    With the plans he had made for the trip:

[Illustration: "THE BEAVER KEPT LOOKING THE OPPOSITE WAY"]

  Navigation was always a difficult art,
    Though with only one ship and one bell:
  And he feared he must really decline, for his part,
    Undertaking another as well STOP The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure
    A second-hand dagger-proof coat--
  So the Baker advised it--and next, to insure
    Its life in some Office of note:

  This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire
    (On moderate terms), or for sale,
  Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,
    And one Against Damage From Hail STOP Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,
    Whenever the Butcher was by,
  The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,
    And appeared unaccountably shy STOP Fit the Second STOP _THE BELLMAN'S SPEECH._

  The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--
    Such a carriage, such ease and such grace STOP Such solemnity, too STOP One could see he was wise,
    The moment one looked in his face STOP He had bought a large map representing the sea,
    Without the least vestige of land:
  And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be
    A map they could all understand STOP "What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,
    Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines? STOP So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply
    "They are merely conventional signs STOP [Illustration: OCEAN-CHART. STOP "Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes STOP But we've got our brave Captain to thank"
  (So the crew would protest) "that he's bought _us_ the best--
    A perfect and absolute blank! STOP This was charming, no doubt: but they shortly found out
    That the Captain they trusted so well
  Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,
    And that was to tingle his bell STOP He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave
    Were enough to bewilder a crew STOP When he cried "Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard! STOP What on earth was the helmsman to do STOP Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:
    A thing, as the Bellman remarked,
  That frequently happens in tropical climes,
    When a vessel is, so to speak, "snarked. STOP But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,
    And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,
  Said he _had_ hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,
    That the ship would _not_ travel due West STOP But the danger was past--they had landed at last,
    With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:
  Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view
    Which consisted of chasms and crags STOP The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,
    And repeated in musical tone
  Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--
    But the crew would do nothing but groan STOP He served out some grog with a liberal hand,
    And bade them sit down on the beach:
  And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,
    As he stood and delivered his speech STOP "Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears STOP (They were all of them fond of quotations:
  So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers
    While he served out additional rations) STOP "We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,
    (Four weeks to the month you may mark),
  But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)
    Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark STOP "We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,
    (Seven days to the week I allow),
  But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,
    We have never beheld till now STOP "Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again
    The five unmistakable marks
  By which you may know, wheresoever you go,
    The warranted genuine Snarks STOP "Let us take them in order STOP The first is the taste,

    They roused him with mustard and cress--
  They roused him with jam and judicious advice--
    They set him conundrums to guess STOP When at length he sat up and was able to speak,
    His sad story he offered to tell;
  And the Bellman cried "Silence STOP Not even a shriek! STOP And excitedly tingled his bell STOP There was silence supreme STOP Not a shriek, not a scream;

    And changed his loose silver for notes:
  The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,
    And shook the dust out of his coats:

  The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade--
    Each working the grindstone in turn:
  But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed
    No interest in the concern:

  Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,
    And vainly proceeded to cite
  A number of cases, in which making laces
    Had been proved an infringement of right STOP The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned

    Was chalking the tip of his nose STOP But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,

    Made an effort to wink with one eye STOP "Be a man! STOP cried the Bellman in wrath, as he heard
    The Butcher beginning to sob STOP "Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,

  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care
    They pursued it with forks and hope;
  They threatened its life with a railway-share;
    They charmed it with smiles and soap STOP Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan
    For making a separate sally;
  And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,
    A dismal and desolate valley STOP But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:
    It had chosen the very same place:
  Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,
    The disgust that appeared in his face STOP Each thought he was thinking of nothing but "Snark"
    And the glorious work of the day;
  And each tried to pretend that he did not remark
    That the other was going that way STOP But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,
    And the evening got darker and colder,
  Till (merely from nervousness, not from good will)
    They marched along shoulder to shoulder STOP Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,
    And they knew that some danger was near:
  The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,
    And even the Butcher felt queer STOP He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--
    That blissful and innocent state--
  The sound so exactly recalled to his mind
    A pencil that squeaks on a slate STOP "'Tis the voice of the Jubjub! STOP he suddenly cried STOP (This man, that they used to call "Dunce." STOP "As the Bellman would tell you," he added with pride,

    Attending to every word:
  But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,
    When the third repetition occurred STOP It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,
    It had somehow contrived to lose count,
  And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains
    By reckoning up the amount STOP "Two added to one--if that could but be done,"
    It said, "with one's fingers and thumbs! STOP Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,
    It had taken no pains with its sums STOP "The thing can be done," said the Butcher, "I think STOP The thing must be done, I am sure STOP The thing shall be done STOP Bring me paper and ink,
    The best there is time to procure. STOP The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,
    And ink in unfailing supplies:
  While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,
    And watched them with wondering eyes STOP So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,
    As he wrote with a pen in each hand,
  And explained all the while in a popular style
    Which the Beaver could well understand STOP "Taking Three as the subject to reason about--
    A convenient number to state--

  "In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been
    Enveloped in absolute mystery,
  And without extra charge I will give you at large
    A Lesson in Natural History. STOP In his genial way he proceeded to say
    (Forgetting all laws of propriety,
  And that giving instruction, without introduction,
    Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),

  "As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,
    Since it lives in perpetual passion:
  Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--
    It is ages ahead of the fashion:

  "But it knows any friend it has met once before:
    It never will look at a bribe:
  And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,
    And collects--though it does not subscribe STOP "Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far

  (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,
    And some, in mahogany kegs:)

  "You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:
    You condense it with locusts and tape:
  Still keeping one principal object in view--
    To preserve its symmetrical shape. STOP The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,
    But he felt that the Lesson must end,
  And he wept with delight in attempting to say
    He considered the Beaver his friend:

  While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks
    More eloquent even than tears,
  It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books
    Would have taught it in seventy years STOP They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned
    (For a moment) with noble emotion,
  Said "This amply repays all the wearisome days

    Have seldom if ever been known;
  In winter or summer, 'twas always the same--
    You could never meet either alone STOP And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds

  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
    They pursued it with forks and hope;
  They threatened its life with a railway-share;
    They charmed it with smiles and soap STOP But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain
    That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,
  Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain
    That his fancy had dwelt on so long STOP He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,
    Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,
  Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig
    On the charge of deserting its sty STOP [Illustration: "'YOU MUST KNOW--' SAID THE JUDGE: BUT THE SNARK EXCLAIMED
'FUDGE!'" STOP The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,
    That the sty was deserted when found:
  And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law
    In a soft under-current of sound STOP The indictment had never been clearly expressed,
    And it seemed that the Snark had begun,
  And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed
    What the pig was supposed to have done STOP The Jury had each formed a different view
    (Long before the indictment was read),
  And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew
    One word that the others had said STOP "You must know--" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed "Fudge STOP That statute is obsolete quite STOP Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends
    On an ancient manorial right STOP "In the matter of Treason the pig would appear
    To have aided, but scarcely abetted:
  While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,
    If you grant the plea 'never indebted. STOP "The fact of Desertion I will not dispute:
    But its guilt, as I trust, is removed
  (So far as relates to the costs of this suit)
    By the Alibi which has been proved STOP "My poor client's fate now depends on your votes. STOP Here the speaker sat down in his place,
  And directed the Judge to refer to his notes
    And briefly to sum up the case STOP But the Judge said he never had summed up before;
    So the Snark undertook it instead,
  And summed it so well that it came to far more
    Than the Witnesses ever had said STOP When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,
    As the word was so puzzling to spell;
  But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind
    Undertaking that duty as well STOP So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,
    It was spent with the toils of the day:
  When it said the word "GUILTY! STOP the Jury all groaned
    And some of them fainted away STOP Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite
    Too nervous to utter a word:
  When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,
    And the fall of a pin might be heard STOP "Transportation for life" was the sentence it gave,
    "And _then_ to be fined forty pound. STOP The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared
    That the phrase was not legally sound STOP But their wild exultation was suddenly checked
    When the jailer informed them, with tears,
  Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,
    As the pig had been dead for some years STOP The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:
    But the Snark, though a little aghast,
  As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,
    Went bellowing on to the last STOP Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed
    To grow every moment more clear:
  Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,

    A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh
  And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,
    For he knew it was useless to fly STOP He offered large discount--he offered a cheque
    (Drawn "to bearer") for seven-pounds-ten:
  But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck
    And grabbed at the Banker again STOP Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws
    Went savagely snapping around--
  He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,
    Till fainting he fell to the ground STOP The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
    Led on by that fear-stricken yell:
  And the Bellman remarked "It is just as I feared! STOP And solemnly tolled on his bell STOP He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace
    The least likeness to what he had been:
  While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white--
    A wonderful thing to be seen STOP [Illustration: "SO GREAT WAS HIS FRIGHT THAT HIS WAISTCOAT TURNED WHITE." STOP To the horror of all who were present that day,

    "He was always a desperate wag! STOP They beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed--

    While they waited and listened in awe STOP "It's a Snark! STOP was the sound that first came to their ears,
    And seemed almost too good to be true STOP Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:
    Then the ominous words "It's a Boo--"

  Then, silence STOP Some fancied they heard in the air

      To make that ladye hark:

  Shrill and more shrill the popinjay
      Upraised his angry squall:
  I trow the doggie's voice that day
      Was louder than them all STOP The serving-men and serving-maids
      Sat by the kitchen fire:
  They heard sic' a din the parlour within
      As made them much admire STOP [Illustration: "O HUSH THEE, GENTLE POPINJAY!" STOP Out spake the boy in buttons
      (I ween he wasna thin),
  "Now wha will tae the parlour gae,
      And stay this deadlie din? STOP And they have taen a kerchief,
      Casted their kevils in,
  For wha should tae the parlour gae,
      And stay that deadlie din STOP When on that boy the kevil fell
      To stay the fearsome noise,
  "Gae in," they cried, "whate'er betide,
      Thou prince of button-boys! STOP Syne, he has taen a supple cane
      To swinge that dog sae fat:
  The doggie yowled, the doggie howled
      The louder aye for that STOP Syne, he has taen a mutton-bane--
      The doggie ceased his noise,
  And followed doon the kitchen stair
      That prince of button-boys STOP [Illustration: "THE DOGGIE CEASED HIS NOISE"]

  Then sadly spake that ladye fair,
      Wi' a frown upon her brow:
  "O dearer to me is my sma' doggie
      Than a dozen sic' as thou STOP "Nae use, nae use for sighs and tears:
      Nae use at all to fret:
  Sin' ye've bided sae well for thirty years,
      Ye may bide a wee langer yet! STOP Sadly, sadly he crossed the floor
      And tirled at the pin:
  Sadly went he through the door
      Where sadly he cam' in STOP "O gin I had a popinjay
      To fly abune my head,
  To tell me what I ought to say,
      I had by this been wed.

  "O gin I find anither ladye,"
      He said wi' sighs and tears,
  "I wot my coortin' sall not be
      Anither thirty years:

  "For gin I find a ladye gay,
      Exactly to my taste,
  I'll pop the question, aye or nay,

FOUR RIDDLES STOP [These consist of two Double Acrostics and two Charades STOP No STOP I. was written at the request of some young friends, who had gone to a
ball at an Oxford Commemoration--and also as a specimen of what might be
done by making the Double Acrostic _a connected poem_ instead of what it
has hitherto been, a string of disjointed stanzas, on every conceivable
subject, and about as interesting to read straight through as a page of a
Cyclopaedia STOP The first two stanzas describe the two main words, and each
subsequent stanza one of the cross "lights. STOP No STOP II STOP was written after seeing Miss Ellen Terry perform in the play of
"Hamlet. STOP In this case the first stanza describes the two main words STOP No STOP III STOP was written after seeing Miss Marion Terry perform in Mr.
Gilbert's play of "Pygmalion and Galatea. STOP The three stanzas respectively
describe "My First," "My Second," and "My Whole." STOP I STOP There was an ancient City, stricken down
    With a strange frenzy, and for many a day
  They paced from morn to eve the crowded town,
              And danced the night away STOP I asked the cause: the aged man grew sad:
    They pointed to a building gray and tall,
  And hoarsely answered "Step inside, my lad,
              And then you'll see it all. STOP Yet what are all such gaieties to me
    Whose thoughts are full of indices and surds STOP x{2} + 7x + 53
              = 11/3 STOP But something whispered "It will soon be done:
    Bands cannot always play, nor ladies smile:
  Endure with patience the distasteful fun
              For just a little while! STOP A change came o'er my Vision--it was night:
    We clove a pathway through a frantic throng:
  The steeds, wild-plunging, filled us with affright:
              The chariots whirled along STOP Within a marble hall a river ran--
    A living tide, half muslin and half cloth:
  And here one mourned a broken wreath or fan,
              Yet swallowed down her wrath;

  And here one offered to a thirsty fair
    (His words half-drowned amid those thunders tuneful)
  Some frozen viand (there were many there),
              A tooth-ache in each spoonful STOP There comes a happy pause, for human strength
    Will not endure to dance without cessation;
  And every one must reach the point at length
              Of absolute prostration STOP At such a moment ladies learn to give,
    To partners who would urge them over-much,
  A flat and yet decided negative--
              Photographers love such STOP There comes a welcome summons--hope revives,
    And fading eyes grow bright, and pulses quicken:
  Incessant pop the corks, and busy knives
              Dispense the tongue and chicken STOP Flushed with new life, the crowd flows back again:
    And all is tangled talk and mazy motion--
  Much like a waving field of golden grain,
              Or a tempestuous ocean STOP And thus they give the time, that Nature meant
    For peaceful sleep and meditative snores,
  To ceaseless din and mindless merriment
              And waste of shoes and floors STOP And One (we name him not) that flies the flowers,
    That dreads the dances, and that shuns the salads,
  They doom to pass in solitude the hours,
              Writing acrostic-ballads STOP How late it grows STOP The hour is surely past
    That should have warned us with its double-knock STOP The twilight wanes, and morning comes at last--
              "Oh, Uncle, what's o'clock? STOP The Uncle gravely nods, and wisely winks STOP It _may_ mean much, but how is one to know STOP He opes his mouth--yet out of it, methinks,
              No words of wisdom flow STOP II STOP Empress of Art, for thee I twine
    This wreath with all too slender skill STOP Forgive my Muse each halting line,
    And for the deed accept the will STOP O day of tears STOP Whence comes this spectre grim,
    Parting, like Death's cold river, souls that love STOP Is not he bound to thee, as thou to him,
    By vows, unwhispered here, yet heard above STOP And still it lives, that keen and heavenward flame,
    Lives in his eye, and trembles in his tone:
  And these wild words of fury but proclaim
    A heart that beats for thee, for thee alone STOP But all is lost: that mighty mind o'erthrown,
    Like sweet bells jangled, piteous sight to see STOP "Doubt that the stars are fire," so runs his moan,
    "Doubt Truth herself, but not my love for thee! STOP A sadder vision yet: thine aged sire
    Shaming his hoary locks with treacherous wile STOP And dost thou now doubt Truth to be a liar STOP And wilt thou die, that hast forgot to smile STOP Nay, get thee hence STOP Leave all thy winsome ways
    And the faint fragrance of thy scattered flowers:
  In holy silence wait the appointed days,
    And weep away the leaden-footed hours STOP III STOP The air is bright with hues of light
    And rich with laughter and with singing:
  Young hearts beat high in ecstasy,
    And banners wave, and bells are ringing:
  But silence falls with fading day,
  And there's an end to mirth and play STOP Ah, well-a-day STOP Rest your old bones, ye wrinkled crones STOP The kettle sings, the firelight dances STOP Deep be it quaffed, the magic draught
    That fills the soul with golden fancies STOP For Youth and Pleasance will not stay,
  And ye are withered, worn, and gray STOP Ah, well-a-day STOP O fair cold face STOP O form of grace,
    For human passion madly yearning STOP O weary air of dumb despair,
    From marble won, to marble turning STOP "Leave us not thus! STOP we fondly pray STOP "We cannot let thee pass away! STOP Ah, well-a-day STOP IV STOP My First is singular at best:
      More plural is my Second:
  My Third is far the pluralest--
  So plural-plural, I protest
      It scarcely can be reckoned STOP My First is followed by a bird:
      My Second by believers
  In magic art: my simple Third
  Follows, too often, hopes absurd
      And plausible deceivers STOP My First to get at wisdom tries--
      A failure melancholy STOP My Second men revered as wise:
  My Third from heights of wisdom flies
      To depths of frantic folly STOP My First is ageing day by day:
      My Second's age is ended:
  My Third enjoys an age, they say,
  That never seems to fade away,
      Through centuries extended STOP My Whole STOP I need a poet's pen
      To paint her myriad phases:
  The monarch, and the slave, of men--
  A mountain-summit, and a den
      Of dark and deadly mazes--

  A flashing light--a fleeting shade--
      Beginning, end, and middle
  Of all that human art hath made
  Or wit devised STOP Go, seek _her_ aid,
      If you would read my riddle STOP FAME'S PENNY-TRUMPET STOP [Affectionately dedicated to all "original researchers" who pant for
"endowment." STOP Blow, blow your trumpets till they crack,
    Ye little men of little souls STOP And bid them huddle at your back--
    Gold-sucking leeches, shoals on shoals STOP Fill all the air with hungry wails--
    "Reward us, ere we think or write STOP Without your Gold mere Knowledge fails
    To sate the swinish appetite! STOP And, where great Plato paced serene,
    Or Newton paused with wistful eye,
  Rush to the chace with hoofs unclean
    And Babel-clamour of the sty STOP Be yours the pay: be theirs the praise:
    We will not rob them of their due,
  Nor vex the ghosts of other days
    By naming them along with you STOP They sought and found undying fame:
    They toiled not for reward nor thanks:
  Their cheeks are hot with honest shame
    For you, the modern mountebanks STOP Who preach of Justice--plead with tears
    That Love and Mercy should abound--
  While marking with complacent ears
    The moaning of some tortured hound:

  Who prate of Wisdom--nay, forbear,
    Lest Wisdom turn on you in wrath,
  Trampling, with heel that will not spare,
    The vermin that beset her path STOP Go, throng each other's drawing-rooms,
    Ye idols of a petty clique:
  Strut your brief hour in borrowed plumes,
    And make your penny-trumpets squeak:

[Illustration: "GO, THRONG EACH OTHER'S DRAWING-ROOMS"]

  Deck your dull talk with pilfered shreds
    Of learning from a nobler time,
  And oil each other's little heads
    With mutual Flattery's golden slime:

  And when the topmost height ye gain,
    And stand in Glory's ether clear,
  And grasp the prize of all your pain--
    So many hundred pounds a year--

  Then let Fame's banner be unfurled STOP Sing Paeans for a victory won STOP Ye tapers, that would light the world,
    And cast a shadow on the Sun--

  Who still shall pour His rays sublime,
    One crystal flood, from East to West,
  When ye have burned your little time
    And feebly flickered into rest STOP THE END STOP [TURN OVER STOP WORKS BY LEWIS CARROLL STOP ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND STOP With Forty-two Illustrations by TENNIEL STOP Crown 8vo, cloth, gilt edges, price 6_s._ Seventy-first Thousand STOP TRANSLATIONS OF THE SAME--into French, by HENRI BUE--into German, by

[Illustration: How doth the little Crocodile]


[Music:

    How doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
    And pour the waters of the Nile
    On ev'ry golden scale STOP How cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spreads his claws,
    And welcomes little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws! STOP [Illustration]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: You are old, Father William]


[Music:

    "You are old, Father William," the young man said,
      "And your hair has become very white;
    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
      Do you think, at your age, it is right? STOP "In my youth," Father William replied to his son,
      "I feared it might injure the brain;
    But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
      Why I do it again and again." STOP [Illustration]

    "You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,
      And have grown most uncommonly fat;
    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
      Pray, what is the reason of that? STOP "In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
      "I kept all my limbs very supple
    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
      Allow me to sell you a couple. STOP "You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak
      For anything tougher than suet;
    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
      Pray, how did you manage to do it? STOP "In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law,
      And argued each case with my wife;
    And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw,
      Has lasted the rest of my life. STOP "You are old," said the youth; "one would hardly suppose
      That your eye was as steady as ever;
    Yet you balance an eel on the end of your nose--
      What made you so awfully clever? STOP "I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"
      Said his father; "don't give yourself airs STOP Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff STOP Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs! STOP [Illustration]




[Illustration: Twinkle, twinkle, little Bat]


[Music:

    Twinkle, twinkle, little bat STOP How I wonder what you're at STOP Up above the world you fly,
    Like a tea-tray in the sky! STOP [Illustration]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: Pig and Pepper]


[Music:

    "Speak roughly to your little boy,
      And beat him when he sneezes;
    He only does it to annoy,
      Because he knows it teases. STOP Wow STOP Wow STOP Wow! STOP "I speak severely to my boy,
      I beat him when he sneezes;
    For he can thoroughly enjoy
      The pepper when he pleases. STOP Wow STOP Wow STOP Wow STOP [Illustration]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: The Lobster Quadrille]


[Music:

    "Will you walk a little faster? STOP said a whiting to a snail,
    "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail STOP See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance STOP They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance STOP Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance STOP Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?" STOP [Illustration]

    "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
    When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea! STOP But the snail replied, "Too far, too far! STOP and gave a look askance--
    Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance STOP Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance STOP Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance STOP "What matters it how far we go? STOP his scaly friend replied;
    "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side STOP The further off from England the nearer is to France--
    Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance STOP Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance STOP Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance? STOP [Illustration]




[Illustration: 'Tis the Voice of the Lobster]


[Music:

    'Tis the voice of the lobster; I heard him declare,
    "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair. STOP As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
    Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes. STOP [Illustration]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: Beautiful Soup]


[Music:

    Beautiful soup, so rich and green,
    Waiting in a hot tureen STOP Who for such dainties would not stoop STOP Soup of the ev'ning, beautiful soup STOP Soup of the ev'ning, beautiful soup STOP Beautiful soo-oop STOP Beautiful soo-oop STOP Soo-oop of the e-e-ev'ning,
          Beautiful, beautiful soo-oo-oop! STOP "Beautiful soup STOP Who cares for fish,
    Game, or any other dish STOP Who would not give all else for two p-
    ennyworth only of beautiful soup STOP Pennyworth only of beautiful soup STOP Beautiful soo-oop STOP Beautiful soo-oop STOP Soo-oop of the e-e-ev'ning,
          Beautiful, beautiful soo-oo-oop! STOP [Illustration]

[Transcriber's Note: The hyphen at the end of the third line of the
second verse is deliberate in the original, so that "two p-"
pronounced as one syllable rhymes with "soup." STOP [Illustration: The Queen of Hearts]


[Music:

    The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away! STOP [Illustration]




[Illustration: Who stole the Tarts]


[Music:

    They told me you had been to her,
      And mentioned me to him:
    She gave me a good character,
      But said I could not swim STOP He sent them word I had not gone
      (We know it to be true):
    If she should push the matter on,
      What would become of you? STOP I gave her one, they gave him two,
      You gave us three or more;
    They all returned from him to you,
      Though they were mine before STOP If I or she should chance to be
      Involved in this affair,
    He trusts to you to set them free,
      Exactly as we were STOP My notion was that you had been
      (Before she had this fit)
    An obstacle that came between
      Him, and ourselves, and it STOP Don't let him know she liked them best,
      For this must ever be
    A secret, kept from all the rest,
      Between yourself and me STOP [Illustration]

[Illustration: Jabberwocky]


[Music:

    'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
    All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe STOP "Beware the Jabberwock, my son STOP The jaws that bite, the claws that catch STOP Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
      The frumious Bandersnatch!" STOP [Illustration]

    He took his vorpal sword in hand:
      Long time the manxome foe he sought--
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
      And stood awhile in thought STOP And as in uffish thought he stood,
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
      And burbled as it came STOP One, two STOP One, two STOP And through and through
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack STOP He left it dead, and with its head
      He went galumphing back STOP "And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?--
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy STOP O frabjous day STOP Callooh STOP Callay! STOP He chortled in his joy STOP 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
    All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe STOP [Illustration]




[Illustration: Tweedledum and Tweedledee]


[Music:

    Tweedledum and Tweedledee
    Agreed to have a battle;
    For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
    Had spoiled his nice new rattle STOP Just then flew down a monstrous crow,
    As black as a tar barrel;
    Which frightened both the heroes so,
    They quite forgot their quarrel. STOP [Illustration]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: The Walrus and the Carpenter]


[Music:

    The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
    He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright--
    And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night. STOP The moon was shining sulkily,
      Because she thought the sun
    Had got no bus'ness to be there
      After the day was done--
    "It's very rude of him," she said,
      "To come and spoil the fun! STOP The sea was wet as wet could be,
      The sands were dry as dry STOP You could not see a cloud, because
      No cloud was in the sky:
    No birds were flying overhead--
      There were no birds to fly STOP The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Were walking close at hand;
    They wept like anything to see
      Such quantities of sand:
    "If this were only cleared away,"
      They said, "it would be grand! STOP "If seven maids with seven mops
      Swept it for half a year,
    Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
      "That they could get it clear? STOP "I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
      And shed a bitter tear STOP "O, Oysters, come and walk with us! STOP The Walrus did beseech,
    "A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
      Along the briny beach:
    We cannot do with more than four,
      To give a hand to each. STOP The eldest Oyster looked at him,
      But never a word he said:
    The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
      And shook his heavy head--
    Meaning to say he did not choose
      To leave the oyster-bed STOP But four young Oysters hurried up,
      All eager for the treat:
    Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
      Their shoes were clean and neat--
    And this was odd, because, you know,
      They hadn't any feet STOP Four other Oysters followed them,
      And yet another four;
    And thick and fast they came at last,
      And more, and more, and more--
    All hopping through the frothy waves,
     And scrambling to the shore STOP [Illustration]

    The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Walked on a mile or so,
    And then they rested on a rock
      Conveniently low;
    And all the little Oysters stood
      And waited in a row STOP "The time has come," the Walrus said,
      "To talk of many things:
    Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
      Of cabbages--and kings--
    And why the sea is boiling hot--
      And whether pigs have wings. STOP "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
      "Before we have our chat;
    For some of us are out of breath,
      And all of us are fat! STOP "No hurry," said the Carpenter:
      They thanked him much for that STOP "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
      "Is chiefly what we need:
    Pepper and vinegar, besides,
      Are very good indeed--
    Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
      We can begin to feed. STOP "But not on us! STOP the Oysters cried,
      Turning a little blue STOP "After such kindness, that would be
      A dismal thing to do! STOP "The night is fine," the Walrus said STOP "Do you admire the view? STOP "It was so kind of you to come STOP And you are very nice! STOP The Carpenter said nothing, but
      "Cut us another slice:
    I wish you were not quite so deaf--
      I've had to ask you twice! STOP "It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
      "To play them such a trick,
    After we've brought them out so far,
      And made them trot so quick! STOP The Carpenter said nothing, but
      "The butter's spread too thick! STOP "I weep for you," the Walrus said:
      "I deeply sympathize. STOP With sobs and tears he sorted out
      Those of the largest size,
    Holding his pocket-handkerchief
      Before his streaming eyes STOP "Oh, Oysters," said the Carpenter,
      "You've had a pleasant run STOP Shall we be trotting home again? STOP But answer came there none--
    And this was scarcely odd, because
      They'd eaten every one STOP [Illustration]

[Music:

    In winter, when the fields are white,
    I sing this song for your delight--

    In spring, when woods are getting green,
    I'll try and tell you what I mean STOP In summer, when the days are long,
    Perhaps you'll understand the song:

    In autumn, when the leaves are brown,
    Take pen and ink, and write it down. STOP [Illustration]

    I sent a message to the fish:
    I told them "This is what I wish. STOP The little fishes of the sea
    They sent an answer back to me STOP The little fishes' answer was
    "We cannot do it, sir, because--"

    I sent to them again to say
    "It will be better to obey. STOP The fishes answered, with a grin,
    "Why, what a temper you are in! STOP I told them once, I told them twice:
    They would not listen to advice STOP I took a kettle large and new,
    Fit for the deed I had to do STOP My heart went hop, my heart went thump;
    I filled the kettle at the pump STOP Then some one came to me, and said,
    "The little fishes are in bed. STOP I said to him, I said it plain,
    "Then you must wake them up again. STOP I said it very loud and clear;
    I went and shouted in his ear STOP But he was very stiff and proud;
    He said, "You needn't shout so loud! STOP And he was very proud and stiff;
    He said, "I'd go and wake them, if--"

    I took a corkscrew from the shelf:
    I went to wake them up myself STOP And when I found the door was locked,
    I pulled and pushed, and kicked and knocked STOP And when I found the door was shut,
    I tried to turn the handle, but--

     from H. BISHOP, arranged by L. BROADWOOD STOP I'll tell thee ev'rything I can;
      There's little to relate STOP I saw an aged, aged man,
      A-sitting on a gate STOP "Who are you, aged man? STOP I said STOP "And how is it you live? STOP And his answer trickled through my head
      Like water through a sieve. STOP He said, "I look for butterflies

    I make them into mutton pies,
      And sell them in the street STOP I sell them unto men," he said,
      "Who sail on stormy seas;

      To what the old man said,
    I cried, "Come, tell me how you live! STOP And thumped him on the head STOP His accents mild took up the tale:
      He said "I go my ways,
    And when I find a mountain rill,
      I set it in a blaze;
    And thence they make a stuff they call
      Rowlands' Macassar Oil--
    Yet two-pence-halfpenny is all
      They give me for my toil! STOP But I was thinking of a way
      To feed oneself on batter,
    And so go on from day to day
      Getting a little fatter STOP I shook him well from side to side,
      Until his face was blue:
    "Come, tell me how you live," I cried,
      "And what it is you do! STOP [Illustration]

      Your honour's noble health. STOP I heard him then, for I had just
      Completed my design
    To keep the Menai bridge from rust

      Might drink my noble health STOP [Illustration]

    I weep, for it reminds me so
      Of that old man I used to know--
    Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow,
    Whose hair was whiter than the snow,
    Whose face was very like a crow,
    With eyes, like cinders, all a-glow,
    Who seem'd distracted with his woe,
    Who rocked his body to and fro,

    As if his mouth were full of dough;

 STOP LESS BREAD STOP MORE TAXES STOP --and then all the people cheered again, and one man, who was more
excited than the rest, flung his hat high into the air, and shouted
(as well as I could make out) "Who roar for the Sub-Warden? STOP Everybody
roared, but whether it was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly
appear: some were shouting "Bread! STOP and some "Taxes STOP ", but no one seemed
to know what it was they really wanted STOP All this I saw from the open window of the Warden's breakfast-saloon,
looking across the shoulder of the Lord Chancellor, who had sprung
to his feet the moment the shouting began, almost as if he had been
expecting it, and had rushed to the window which commanded the best view
of the market-place STOP "What can it all mean? STOP he kept repeating to himself, as, with his hands
clasped behind him, and his gown floating in the air, he paced rapidly
up and down the room STOP "I never heard such shouting before--and at this
time of the morning, too STOP And with such unanimity STOP Doesn't it strike you
as very remarkable? STOP I represented, modestly, that to my ears it appeared that they were
shouting for different things, but the Chancellor would not listen to my
suggestion for a moment STOP "They all shout the same words, I assure you! STOP he said: then, leaning well out of the window, he whispered to a man who
was standing close underneath, "Keep'em together, ca'n't you STOP The Warden
will be here directly STOP Give'em the signal for the march up! STOP All this
was evidently not meant for my ears, but I could scarcely help hearing
it, considering that my chin was almost on the Chancellor's shoulder STOP The 'march up' was a very curious sight:

{Image...The march-up}

a straggling procession of men, marching two and two, began from the
other side of the market-place, and advanced in an irregular zig-zag
fashion towards the Palace, wildly tacking from side to side, like a
sailing vessel making way against an unfavourable wind so that the head
of the procession was often further from us at the end of one tack than
it had been at the end of the previous one STOP Yet it was evident that all was being done under orders, for I noticed
that all eyes were fixed on the man who stood just under the window, and
to whom the Chancellor was continually whispering STOP This man held his hat
in one hand and a little green flag in the other: whenever he waved the
flag the procession advanced a little nearer, when he dipped it they
sidled a little farther off, and whenever he waved his hat they all
raised a hoarse cheer STOP "Hoo-roah! STOP they cried, carefully keeping time
with the hat as it bobbed up and down STOP "Hoo-roah STOP Noo STOP Consti STOP Tooshun STOP Less STOP Bread STOP More STOP Taxes! STOP "That'll do, that'll do! STOP the Chancellor whispered STOP "Let 'em rest a bit
till I give you the word STOP He's not here yet! STOP But at this moment the
great folding-doors of the saloon were flung open, and he turned with a
guilty start to receive His High Excellency STOP However it was only Bruno,
and the Chancellor gave a little gasp of relieved anxiety STOP "Morning! STOP said the little fellow, addressing the remark, in a general
sort of way, to the Chancellor and the waiters STOP "Doos oo know where
Sylvie is STOP I's looking for Sylvie! STOP "She's with the Warden, I believe, y'reince! STOP the Chancellor replied
with a low bow STOP There was, no doubt, a certain amount of absurdity in
applying this title (which, as of course you see without my telling you,
was nothing but 'your Royal Highness' condensed into one syllable) to
a small creature whose father was merely the Warden of Outland: still,
large excuse must be made for a man who had passed several years at the
Court of Fairyland, and had there acquired the almost impossible art of
pronouncing five syllables as one STOP But the bow was lost upon Bruno, who had run out of the room, even
while the great feat of The Unpronounceable Monosyllable was being
triumphantly performed STOP Just then, a single voice in the distance was understood to shout "A
speech from the Chancellor! STOP "Certainly, my friends! STOP the Chancellor
replied with extraordinary promptitude STOP "You shall have a speech! STOP Here one of the waiters, who had been for some minutes busy making a
queer-looking mixture of egg and sherry, respectfully presented it on
a large silver salver STOP The Chancellor took it haughtily, drank it off
thoughtfully, smiled benevolently on the happy waiter as he set down the
empty glass, and began STOP To the best of my recollection this is what he
said STOP "Ahem STOP Ahem STOP Ahem STOP Fellow-sufferers, or rather suffering fellows--"
("Don't call 'em names! STOP muttered the man under the window STOP "I didn't
say felons! STOP the Chancellor explained. STOP "You may be sure that I always
sympa--" ("'Ear, 'ear! STOP shouted the crowd, so loudly as quite to drown
the orator's thin squeaky voice) "--that I always sympa--" he repeated STOP ("Don't simper quite so much! STOP said the man under the window STOP "It makes
yer look a hidiot! STOP And, all this time, "'Ear, 'ear! STOP went rumbling
round the market-place, like a peal of thunder. STOP "That I always
sympathise! STOP yelled the Chancellor, the first moment there was silence STOP "But your true friend is the Sub-Warden STOP Day and night he is brooding on
your wrongs--I should say your rights--that is to say your wrongs--no,
I mean your rights--" ("Don't talk no more! STOP growled the man under the
window STOP "You're making a mess of it!" STOP At this moment the Sub-Warden
entered the saloon STOP He was a thin man, with a mean and crafty face,
and a greenish-yellow complexion; and he crossed the room very slowly,
looking suspiciously about him as if he thought there might be a savage
dog hidden somewhere STOP "Bravo! STOP he cried, patting the Chancellor on the
back STOP "You did that speech very well indeed STOP Why, you're a born orator,
man! STOP "Oh, that's nothing! STOP the Chancellor replied, modestly, with downcast
eyes STOP "Most orators are born, you know. STOP The Sub-Warden thoughtfully rubbed his chin STOP "Why, so they are! STOP he
admitted STOP "I never considered it in that light STOP Still, you did it very
well STOP A word in your ear! STOP The rest of their conversation was all in whispers: so, as I could hear
no more, I thought I would go and find Bruno STOP I found the little fellow standing in the passage, and being addressed
by one of the men in livery, who stood before him, nearly bent double
from extreme respectfulness, with his hands hanging in front of him
like the fins of a fish STOP "His High Excellency," this respectful man was
saying, "is in his Study, y'reince! STOP (He didn't pronounce this quite so
well as the Chancellor. STOP Thither Bruno trotted, and I thought it well to
follow him STOP The Warden, a tall dignified man with a grave but very pleasant face,
was seated before a writing-table, which was covered with papers, and
holding on his knee one of the sweetest and loveliest little maidens it
has ever been my lot to see STOP She looked four or five years older than
Bruno, but she had the same rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes, and the same
wealth of curly brown hair STOP Her eager smiling face was turned upwards
towards her father's, and it was a pretty sight to see the mutual love
with which the two faces--one in the Spring of Life, the other in its
late Autumn--were gazing on each other STOP "No, you've never seen him," the old man was saying: "you couldn't, you
know, he's been away so long--traveling from land to land, and seeking
for health, more years than you've been alive, little Sylvie! STOP Here
Bruno climbed upon his other knee, and a good deal of kissing, on a
rather complicated system, was the result STOP "He only came back last night," said the Warden, when the kissing was
over: "he's been traveling post-haste, for the last thousand miles or
so, in order to be here on Sylvie's birthday STOP But he's a very early
riser, and I dare say he's in the Library already STOP Come with me and see
him STOP He's always kind to children STOP You'll be sure to like him. STOP "Has the Other Professor come too? STOP Bruno asked in an awe-struck voice STOP "Yes, they arrived together STOP The Other Professor is--well, you won't
like him quite so much, perhaps STOP He's a little more dreamy, you know. STOP "I wiss Sylvie was a little more dreamy," said Bruno STOP "What do you mean, Bruno? STOP said Sylvie STOP Bruno went on addressing his father STOP "She says she ca'n't, oo know STOP But
I thinks it isn't ca'n't, it's wo'n't. STOP "Says she ca'n't dream! STOP the puzzled Warden repeated STOP "She do say it," Bruno persisted STOP "When I says to her 'Let's stop
lessons STOP ', she says 'Oh, I ca'n't dream of letting oo stop yet!' STOP "He always wants to stop lessons," Sylvie explained, "five minutes after
we begin! STOP "Five minutes' lessons a day! STOP said the Warden STOP "You won't learn much at
that rate, little man! STOP "That's just what Sylvie says," Bruno rejoined STOP "She says I wo'n't learn
my lessons STOP And I tells her, over and over, I ca'n't learn 'em STOP And what
doos oo think she says STOP She says 'It isn't ca'n't, it's wo'n't!' STOP "Let's go and see the Professor," the Warden said, wisely avoiding
further discussion STOP The children got down off his knees, each secured a
hand, and the happy trio set off for the Library--followed by me STOP I had
come to the conclusion by this time that none of the party (except, for
a few moments, the Lord Chancellor) was in the least able to see me STOP "What's the matter with him? STOP Sylvie asked, walking with a little extra
sedateness, by way of example to Bruno at the other side, who never
ceased jumping up and down STOP {Image...Visiting the profesor}

"What was the matter--but I hope he's all right now--was lumbago, and
rheumatism, and that kind of thing STOP He's been curing himself, you
know: he's a very learned doctor STOP Why, he's actually invented three new
diseases, besides a new way of breaking your collar-bone! STOP "Is it a nice way? STOP said Bruno STOP "Well, hum, not very," the Warden said, as we entered the Library STOP "And
here is the Professor STOP Good morning, Professor STOP Hope you're quite rested
after your journey! STOP A jolly-looking, fat little man, in a flowery dressing-gown, with a
large book under each arm, came trotting in at the other end of the
room, and was going straight across without taking any notice of the
children STOP "I'm looking for Vol STOP Three," he said STOP "Do you happen to have
seen it? STOP "You don't see my children, Professor! STOP the Warden exclaimed, taking him
by the shoulders and turning him round to face them STOP The Professor laughed violently: then he gazed at them through his great
spectacles, for a minute or two, without speaking STOP At last he addressed Bruno STOP "I hope you have had a good night, my
child? STOP Bruno looked puzzled STOP "I's had the same night oo've had," he
replied STOP "There's only been one night since yesterday! STOP It was the Professor's turn to look puzzled now STOP He took off his
spectacles, and rubbed them with his handkerchief STOP Then he gazed at them
again STOP Then he turned to the Warden STOP "Are they bound? STOP he enquired STOP "No, we aren't," said Bruno, who thought himself quite able to answer
this question STOP The Professor shook his head sadly STOP "Not even half-bound? STOP "Why would we be half-bound? STOP said Bruno STOP "We're not prisoners! STOP But the Professor had forgotten all about them by this time, and was
speaking to the Warden again STOP "You'll be glad to hear," he was saying,
"that the Barometer's beginning to move--"

"Well, which way? STOP said the Warden--adding, to the children, "Not that
I care, you know STOP Only he thinks it affects the weather STOP He's a
wonderfully clever man, you know STOP Sometimes he says things that only the
Other Professor can understand STOP Sometimes he says things that nobody can
understand STOP Which way is it, Professor STOP Up or down? STOP "Neither! STOP said the Professor, gently clapping his hands STOP "It's going
sideways--if I may so express myself. STOP "And what kind of weather does that produce? STOP said the Warden STOP "Listen,
children STOP Now you'll hear something worth knowing! STOP "Horizontal weather," said the Professor, and made straight for the
door, very nearly trampling on Bruno, who had only just time to get out
of his way STOP "Isn't he learned? STOP the Warden said, looking after him with admiring
eyes STOP "Positively he runs over with learning! STOP "But he needn't run over me! STOP said Bruno STOP The Professor was back in a moment: he had changed his dressing-gown for
a frock-coat, and had put on a pair of very strange-looking boots, the
tops of which were open umbrellas STOP "I thought you'd like to see them,"
he said STOP "These are the boots for horizontal weather! STOP {Image...Boots for horizontal weather}

"But what's the use of wearing umbrellas round one's knees? STOP "In ordinary rain," the Professor admitted, "they would not be of
much use STOP But if ever it rained horizontally, you know, they would be
invaluable--simply invaluable! STOP "Take the Professor to the breakfast-saloon, children," said the Warden STOP "And tell them not to wait for me STOP I had breakfast early, as I've some
business to attend to. STOP The children seized the Professor's hands, as
familiarly as if they had known him for years, and hurried him away STOP I
followed respectfully behind STOP  STOP L'AMIE INCONNUE STOP As we entered the breakfast-saloon, the Professor was saying "--and he
had breakfast by himself, early: so he begged you wouldn't wait for him,
my Lady STOP This way, my Lady," he added, "this way! STOP And then, with (as it
seemed to me) most superfluous politeness, he flung open the door of my
compartment, and ushered in "--a young and lovely lady! STOP I muttered to
myself with some bitterness STOP "And this is, of course, the opening
scene of Vol STOP I STOP She is the Heroine STOP And I am one of those subordinate
characters that only turn up when needed for the development of her
destiny, and whose final appearance is outside the church, waiting to
greet the Happy Pair! STOP "Yes, my Lady, change at Fayfield," were the next words I heard (oh that
too obsequious Guard STOP ), "next station but one. STOP And the door closed, and
the lady settled down into her corner, and the monotonous throb of the
engine (making one feel as if the train were some gigantic monster,
whose very circulation we could feel) proclaimed that we were once more
speeding on our way STOP "The lady had a perfectly formed nose," I caught
myself saying to myself, "hazel eyes, and lips--" and here it occurred
to me that to see, for myself, what "the lady" was really like, would be
more satisfactory than much speculation STOP I looked round cautiously, and--was entirely disappointed of my hope STOP The veil, which shrouded her whole face, was too thick for me to see
more than the glitter of bright eyes and the hazy outline of what might
be a lovely oval face, but might also, unfortunately, be an equally
unlovely one STOP I closed my eyes again, saying to myself "--couldn't have
a better chance for an experiment in Telepathy STOP I'll think out her face,
and afterwards test the portrait with the original. STOP At first, no result at all crowned my efforts, though I 'divided my
swift mind,' now hither, now thither, in a way that I felt sure would
have made AEneas green with envy: but the dimly-seen oval remained as
provokingly blank as ever--a mere Ellipse, as if in some mathematical
diagram, without even the Foci that might be made to do duty as a nose
and a mouth STOP Gradually, however, the conviction came upon me that I
could, by a certain concentration of thought, think the veil away, and
so get a glimpse of the mysterious face--as to which the two questions,
"is she pretty? STOP and "is she plain STOP ", still hung suspended, in my mind,
in beautiful equipoise STOP Success was partial--and fitful--still there was a result: ever and
anon, the veil seemed to vanish, in a sudden flash of light: but,
before I could fully realise the face, all was dark again STOP In each such
glimpse, the face seemed to grow more childish and more innocent:
and, when I had at last thought the veil entirely away, it was,
unmistakeably, the sweet face of little Sylvie STOP "So, either I've been dreaming about Sylvie," I said to myself, "and
this is the reality STOP Or else I've really been with Sylvie, and this is a
dream STOP Is Life itself a dream, I wonder? STOP To occupy the time, I got out the letter, which had caused me to take
this sudden railway-journey from my London home down to a strange
fishing-town on the North coast, and read it over again:--


    "DEAR OLD FRIEND,

    "I'm sure it will be as great a pleasure to me, as it can possibly
    be to you, to meet once more after so many years: and of course I
    shall be ready to give you all the benefit of such medical skill as
    I have: only, you know, one mustn't violate professional etiquette STOP And you are already in the hands of a first-rate London doctor,
    with whom it would be utter affectation for me to pretend to compete STOP (I make no doubt he is right in saying the heart is affected:
    all your symptoms point that way. STOP One thing, at any rate, I have
    already done in my doctorial capacity--secured you a bedroom on the
    ground-floor, so that you will not need to ascend the stairs at all STOP "I shalt expect you by last train on Friday, in accordance with your
    letter: and, till then, I shalt say, in the words of the old song,
    'Oh for Friday nicht STOP Friday's lang a-coming! STOP "Yours always,

    "ARTHUR FORESTER STOP "P.S STOP Do you believe in Fate? STOP This Postscript puzzled me sorely STOP "He is far too sensible a man," I
thought, "to have become a Fatalist STOP And yet what else can he mean by
it? STOP And, as I folded up the letter and put it away, I inadvertently
repeated the words aloud STOP "Do you believe in Fate? STOP The fair 'Incognita' turned her head quickly at the sudden question STOP "No, I don't! STOP she said with a smile STOP "Do you? STOP "I--I didn't mean to ask the question! STOP I stammered, a little taken
aback at having begun a conversation in so unconventional a fashion STOP The lady's smile became a laugh--not a mocking laugh, but the laugh of a
happy child who is perfectly at her ease STOP "Didn't you? STOP she said STOP "Then
it was a case of what you Doctors call 'unconscious cerebration'? STOP "I am no Doctor," I replied STOP "Do I look so like one STOP Or what makes you
think it? STOP She pointed to the book I had been reading, which was so lying that its
title, "Diseases of the Heart," was plainly visible STOP "One needn't be a Doctor," I said, "to take an interest in medical
books STOP There's another class of readers, who are yet more deeply
interested--"

"You mean the Patients? STOP she interrupted, while a look of tender pity
gave new sweetness to her face STOP "But," with an evident wish to avoid a
possibly painful topic, "one needn't be either, to take an interest in
books of Science STOP Which contain the greatest amount of Science, do you
think, the books, or the minds? STOP "Rather a profound question for a lady! STOP I said to myself, holding, with
the conceit so natural to Man, that Woman's intellect is essentially
shallow STOP And I considered a minute before replying STOP "If you mean living
minds, I don't think it's possible to decide STOP There is so much written
Science that no living person has ever read: and there is so much
thought-out Science that hasn't yet been written STOP But, if you mean the
whole human race, then I think the minds have it: everything, recorded
in books, must have once been in some mind, you know. STOP "Isn't that rather like one of the Rules in Algebra? STOP my Lady enquired STOP ("Algebra too! STOP I thought with increasing wonder. STOP "I mean, if we
consider thoughts as factors, may we not say that the Least Common
Multiple of all the minds contains that of all the books; but not the
other way? STOP "Certainly we may! STOP I replied, delighted with the illustration STOP "And
what a grand thing it would be," I went on dreamily, thinking aloud
rather than talking, "if we could only apply that Rule to books STOP You
know, in finding the Least Common Multiple, we strike out a quantity
wherever it occurs, except in the term where it is raised to its highest
power STOP So we should have to erase every recorded thought, except in the
sentence where it is expressed with the greatest intensity. STOP My Lady laughed merrily STOP "Some books would be reduced to blank paper,
I'm afraid! STOP she said STOP "They would STOP Most libraries would be terribly diminished in bulk STOP But
just think what they would gain in quality! STOP "When will it be done? STOP she eagerly asked STOP "If there's any chance of it
in my time, I think I'll leave off reading, and wait for it! STOP "Well, perhaps in another thousand years or so--"

"Then there's no use waiting STOP ", said my Lady STOP "Let's sit down STOP Uggug, my
pet, come and sit by me! STOP "Anywhere but by me! STOP growled the Sub-warden STOP "The little wretch always
manages to upset his coffee! STOP I guessed at once (as perhaps the reader will also have guessed, if,
like myself, he is very clever at drawing conclusions) that my Lady was
the Sub-Warden's wife, and that Uggug (a hideous fat boy, about the same
age as Sylvie, with the expression of a prize-pig) was their son STOP Sylvie
and Bruno, with the Lord Chancellor, made up a party of seven STOP {Image...A portable plunge-bath}

"And you actually got a plunge-bath every morning? STOP said the Sub-Warden,
seemingly in continuation of a conversation with the Professor STOP "Even at
the little roadside-inns? STOP "Oh, certainly, certainly! STOP the Professor replied with a smile on his
jolly face STOP "Allow me to explain STOP It is, in fact, a very simple problem
in Hydrodynamics STOP (That means a combination of Water and Strength. STOP If we take a plunge-bath, and a man of great strength (such as myself)
about to plunge into it, we have a perfect example of this science STOP I
am bound to admit," the Professor continued, in a lower tone and with
downcast eyes, "that we need a man of remarkable strength STOP He must be
able to spring from the floor to about twice his own height, gradually
turning over as he rises, so as to come down again head first. STOP "Why, you need a flea, not a man! STOP exclaimed the Sub-Warden STOP "Pardon me," said the Professor STOP "This particular kind of bath is
not adapted for a flea STOP Let us suppose," he continued, folding his
table-napkin into a graceful festoon, "that this represents what is
perhaps the necessity of this Age--the Active Tourist's Portable Bath STOP You may describe it briefly, if you like," looking at the Chancellor,
"by the letters A.T.P.B. STOP The Chancellor, much disconcerted at finding everybody looking at him,
could only murmur, in a shy whisper, "Precisely so! STOP "One great advantage of this plunge-bath," continued the Professor, "is
that it requires only half-a-gallon of water--"

"I don't call it a plunge-bath," His Sub-Excellency remarked, "unless
your Active Tourist goes right under! STOP "But he does go right under," the old man gently replied STOP "The A.T.
hangs up the P. B. on a nail--thus STOP He then empties the water-jug into
it--places the empty jug below the bag--leaps into the air--descends
head-first into the bag--the water rises round him to the top of the
bag--and there you are! STOP he triumphantly concluded STOP "The A.T. is as much
under water as if he'd gone a mile or two down into the Atlantic! STOP "And he's drowned, let us say, in about four minutes--"

"By no means! STOP the Professor answered with a proud smile STOP "After about
a minute, he quietly turns a tap at the lower end of the P STOP B.--all the
water runs back into the jug and there you are again! STOP "But how in the world is he to get out of the bag again? STOP "That, I take it," said the Professor, "is the most beautiful part of
the whole invention STOP All the way up the P.B., inside, are loops for
the thumbs; so it's something like going up-stairs, only perhaps less
comfortable; and, by the time the A. T. has risen out of the bag, all
but his head, he's sure to topple over, one way or the other--the Law of
Gravity secures that STOP And there he is on the floor again! STOP "A little bruised, perhaps? STOP "Well, yes, a little bruised; but having had his plunge-bath: that's the
great thing. STOP "Wonderful STOP It's almost beyond belief! STOP murmured the Sub-Warden STOP The
Professor took it as a compliment, and bowed with a gratified smile STOP "Quite beyond belief! STOP my Lady added--meaning, no doubt, to be more
complimentary still STOP The Professor bowed, but he didn't smile this time STOP "I can assure you," he said earnestly, "that, provided the bath was
made, I used it every morning STOP I certainly ordered it--that I am clear
about--my only doubt is, whether the man ever finished making it STOP It's
difficult to remember, after so many years--"

At this moment the door, very slowly and creakingly, began to open, and
Sylvie and Bruno jumped up, and ran to meet the well-known footstep STOP  STOP BIRTHDAY-PRESENTS STOP "It's my brother! STOP the Sub-warden exclaimed, in a warning whisper STOP "Speak out, and be quick about it! STOP The appeal was evidently addressed to the Lord Chancellor, who instantly
replied, in a shrill monotone, like a little boy repeating the alphabet,
"As I was remarking, your Sub-Excellency, this portentous movement--"

"You began too soon! STOP the other interrupted, scarcely able to restrain
himself to a whisper, so great was his excitement STOP "He couldn't have
heard you STOP Begin again! STOP "As I was remarking," chanted the obedient Lord
Chancellor, "this portentous movement has already assumed the dimensions
of a Revolution! STOP "And what are the dimensions of a Revolution? STOP The voice was genial and
mellow, and the face of the tall dignified old man, who had just entered
the room, leading Sylvie by the hand, and with Bruno riding triumphantly
on his shoulder, was too noble and gentle to have scared a less guilty
man: but the Lord Chancellor turned pale instantly, and could hardly
articulate the words "The dimensions your--your High Excellency STOP I--I--scarcely comprehend! STOP "Well, the length, breadth, and thickness, if you like it better! STOP And
the old man smiled, half-contemptuously STOP The Lord Chancellor recovered himself with a great effort, and pointed
to the open window STOP "If your High Excellency will listen for a moment
to the shouts of the exasperated populace--" ("of the exasperated
populace! STOP the Sub-Warden repeated in a louder tone, as the Lord
Chancellor, being in a state of abject terror, had dropped almost into a
whisper) "--you will understand what it is they want. STOP And at that moment there surged into the room a hoarse confused cry, in
which the only clearly audible words were "Less--bread--More--taxes! STOP The old man laughed heartily STOP "What in the world--" he was beginning:
but the Chancellor heard him not STOP "Some mistake! STOP he muttered, hurrying
to the window, from which he shortly returned with an air of relief STOP "Now listen! STOP he exclaimed, holding up his hand impressively STOP And now
the words came quite distinctly, and with the regularity of the ticking
of a clock, "More--bread--Less taxes!' STOP "More bread! STOP the Warden repeated in astonishment STOP "Why, the new
Government Bakery was opened only last week, and I gave orders to sell
the bread at cost-price during the present scarcity STOP What can they
expect more? STOP "The Bakery's closed, y'reince! STOP the Chancellor said, more loudly and
clearly than he had spoken yet STOP He was emboldened by the consciousness
that here, at least, he had evidence to produce: and he placed in the
Warden's hands a few printed notices, that were lying ready, with some
open ledgers, on a side-table STOP "Yes, yes, I see! STOP the Warden muttered, glancing carelessly through
them STOP "Order countermanded by my brother, and supposed to be my doing STOP Rather sharp practice STOP It's all right! STOP he added in a louder tone STOP "My
name is signed to it: so I take it on myself STOP But what do they mean by
'Less Taxes' STOP How can they be less STOP I abolished the last of them a month
ago! STOP "It's been put on again, y'reince, and by y'reince's own orders STOP ", and
other printed notices were submitted for inspection STOP The Warden, whilst looking them over, glanced once or twice at the
Sub-Warden, who had seated himself before one of the open ledgers, and
was quite absorbed in adding it up; but he merely repeated "It's all
right STOP I accept it as my doing. STOP "And they do say," the Chancellor went on sheepishly--looking much
more like a convicted thief than an Officer of State, "that a change
of Government, by the abolition of the Sub-Warden---I mean," he hastily
added, on seeing the Warden's look of astonishment, "the abolition of
the office of Sub-Warden, and giving the present holder the right to
act as Vice-Warden whenever the Warden is absent--would appease all this
seedling discontent I mean," he added, glancing at a paper he held in
his hand, "all this seething discontent! STOP "For fifteen years," put in a deep but very harsh voice, "my husband has
been acting as Sub-Warden STOP It is too long STOP It is much too long! STOP My Lady
was a vast creature at all times: but, when she frowned and folded her
arms, as now, she looked more gigantic than ever, and made one try to
fancy what a haystack would look like, if out of temper STOP "He would distinguish himself as a Vice! STOP my Lady proceeded, being far
too stupid to see the double meaning of her words STOP "There has been no
such Vice in Outland for many a long year, as he would be! STOP "What course would you suggest, Sister? STOP the Warden mildly enquired STOP My Lady stamped, which was undignified: and snorted, which was
ungraceful STOP "This is no jesting matter! STOP she bellowed STOP "I will consult my brother," said the Warden STOP "Brother! STOP "--and seven makes a hundred and ninety-four, which is sixteen and
two-pence," the Sub-Warden replied STOP "Put down two and carry sixteen. STOP The Chancellor raised his hands and eyebrows, lost in admiration STOP "Such
a man of business! STOP he murmured STOP "Brother, could I have a word with you in my Study? STOP the Warden said in
a louder tone STOP The Sub-Warden rose with alacrity, and the two left the
room together STOP My Lady turned to the Professor, who had uncovered the urn, and was
taking its temperature with his pocket-thermometer STOP "Professor! STOP she
began, so loudly and suddenly that even Uggug, who had gone to sleep in
his chair, left off snoring and opened one eye STOP The Professor pocketed
his thermometer in a moment, clasped his hands, and put his head on one
side with a meek smile STOP "You were teaching my son before breakfast, I believe? STOP my Lady loftily
remarked STOP "I hope he strikes you as having talent? STOP "Oh, very much so indeed, my Lady! STOP the Professor hastily replied,
unconsciously rubbing his ear, while some painful recollection seemed
to cross his mind STOP "I was very forcibly struck by His Magnificence, I
assure you! STOP "He is a charming boy! STOP my Lady exclaimed STOP "Even his snores are more
musical than those of other boys! STOP If that were so, the Professor seemed to think, the snores of other boys
must be something too awful to be endured: but he was a cautious man,
and he said nothing STOP "And he's so clever! STOP my Lady continued STOP "No one will enjoy your Lecture
more by the way, have you fixed the time for it yet STOP You've never given
one, you know: and it was promised years ago, before you--

"Yes, yes, my Lady, I know STOP Perhaps next Tuesday or Tuesday week--"

"That will do very well," said my Lady, graciously STOP "Of course you will
let the Other Professor lecture as well? STOP "I think not, my Lady? STOP the Professor said with some hesitation STOP "You
see, he always stands with his back to the audience STOP It does very well
for reciting; but for lecturing--"

"You are quite right," said my Lady STOP "And, now I come to think of it,
there would hardly be time for more than one Lecture STOP And it will go off
all the better, if we begin with a Banquet, and a Fancy-dress Ball--"

"It will indeed! STOP the Professor cried, with enthusiasm STOP "I shall come as a Grass-hopper," my Lady calmly proceeded STOP "What shall
you come as, Professor? STOP The Professor smiled feebly STOP "I shall come as--as early as I can, my
Lady! STOP "You mustn't come in before the doors are opened," said my Lady STOP "I ca'n't," said the Professor STOP "Excuse me a moment STOP As this is Lady
Sylvie's birthday, I would like to--" and he rushed away STOP Bruno began feeling in his pockets, looking more and more melancholy
as he did so: then he put his thumb in his mouth, and considered for a
minute: then he quietly left the room STOP He had hardly done so before the Professor was back again, quite out of
breath STOP "Wishing you many happy returns of the day, my dear child! STOP he
went on, addressing the smiling little girl, who had run to meet him STOP "Allow me to give you a birthday-present STOP It's a second-hand pincushion,
my dear STOP And it only cost fourpence-halfpenny! STOP "Thank you, it's very pretty! STOP And Sylvie rewarded the old man with a
hearty kiss STOP "And the pins they gave me for nothing! STOP the Professor added in high
glee STOP "Fifteen of 'em, and only one bent! STOP "I'll make the bent one into a hook! STOP said Sylvie STOP "To catch Bruno with,
when he runs away from his lessons! STOP "You ca'n't guess what my present is! STOP said Uggug, who had taken the
butter-dish from the table, and was standing behind her, with a wicked
leer on his face STOP "No, I ca'n't guess," Sylvie said without looking up STOP She was still
examining the Professor's pincushion STOP "It's this! STOP cried the bad boy, exultingly, as he emptied the dish over
her, and then, with a grin of delight at his own cleverness, looked
round for applause STOP Sylvie coloured crimson, as she shook off the butter from her frock: but
she kept her lips tight shut, and walked away to the window, where she
stood looking out and trying to recover her temper STOP Uggug's triumph was a very short one: the Sub-Warden had returned, just
in time to be a witness of his dear child's playfulness, and in another
moment a skilfully-applied box on the ear had changed the grin of
delight into a howl of pain STOP "My darling! STOP cried his mother, enfolding him in her fat arms STOP "Did they
box his ears for nothing STOP A precious pet! STOP "It's not for nothing! STOP growled the angry father STOP "Are you aware, Madam,
that I pay the house-bills, out of a fixed annual sum STOP The loss of all
that wasted butter falls on me STOP Do you hear, Madam! STOP "Hold your tongue, Sir! STOP My Lady spoke very quietly--almost in a
whisper STOP But there was something in her look which silenced him STOP "Don't
you see it was only a joke STOP And a very clever one, too STOP He only meant
that he loved nobody but her STOP And, instead of being pleased with the
compliment, the spiteful little thing has gone away in a huff! STOP The Sub-Warden was a very good hand at changing a subject STOP He walked
across to the window STOP "My dear," he said, "is that a pig that I see down
below, rooting about among your flower-beds? STOP "A pig! STOP shrieked my Lady, rushing madly to the window, and almost
pushing her husband out, in her anxiety to see for herself STOP "Whose pig
is it STOP How did it get in STOP Where's that crazy Gardener gone? STOP At this moment Bruno re-entered the room, and passing Uggug (who was
blubbering his loudest, in the hope of attracting notice) as if he was
quite used to that sort of thing, he ran up to Sylvie and threw his arms
round her STOP "I went to my toy-cupboard," he said with a very sorrowful
face, "to see if there were somefin fit for a present for oo STOP And there
isn't nuffin STOP They's all broken, every one STOP And I haven't got no money
left, to buy oo a birthday-present STOP And I ca'n't give oo nuffin but
this! STOP ("This" was a very earnest hug and a kiss. STOP "Oh, thank you, darling! STOP cried Sylvie STOP "I like your present best of
all! STOP (But if so, why did she give it back so quickly? STOP His Sub-Excellency turned and patted the two children on the head with
his long lean hands STOP "Go away, dears! STOP he said STOP "There's business to
talk over. STOP Sylvie and Bruno went away hand in hand: but, on reaching the door,
Sylvie came back again and went up to Uggug timidly STOP "I don't mind about
the butter," she said, "and I--I'm sorry he hurt you! STOP And she tried to
shake hands with the little ruffian: but Uggug only blubbered louder,
and wouldn't make friends STOP Sylvie left the room with a sigh STOP The Sub-Warden glared angrily at his weeping son STOP "Leave the room,
Sirrah! STOP he said, as loud as he dared STOP His wife was still leaning out of
the window, and kept repeating "I ca'n't see that pig STOP Where is it? STOP "It's moved to the right now it's gone a little to the left," said the
Sub-Warden: but he had his back to the window, and was making signals to
the Lord Chancellor, pointing to Uggug and the door, with many a cunning
nod and wink STOP {Image...Removal of Uggug}

The Chancellor caught his meaning at last, and, crossing the room, took
that interesting child by the ear the next moment he and Uggug were out
of the room, and the door shut behind them: but not before one piercing
yell had rung through the room, and reached the ears of the fond mother STOP "What is that hideous noise? STOP she fiercely asked, turning upon her
startled husband STOP "It's some hyaena--or other," replied the Sub-Warden, looking vaguely up
to the ceiling, as if that was where they usually were to be found STOP "Let
us to business, my dear STOP Here comes the Warden. STOP And he picked up from
the floor a wandering scrap of manuscript, on which I just caught the
words 'after which Election duly holden the said Sibimet and Tabikat
his wife may at their pleasure assume Imperial--' before, with a guilty
look, he crumpled it up in his hand STOP  STOP A CUNNING CONSPIRACY STOP The Warden entered at this moment: and close behind him came the Lord
Chancellor, a little flushed and out of breath, and adjusting his wig,
which appeared to have been dragged partly off his head STOP "But where is my precious child? STOP my Lady enquired, as the four took
their seats at the small side-table devoted to ledgers and bundles and
bills STOP "He left the room a few minutes ago with the Lord Chancellor," the
Sub-Warden briefly explained STOP "Ah! STOP said my Lady, graciously smiling on that high official STOP "Your
Lordship has a very taking way with children STOP I doubt if any one could
gain the ear of my darling Uggug so quickly as you can! STOP For an entirely
stupid woman, my Lady's remarks were curiously full of meaning, of which
she herself was wholly unconscious STOP The Chancellor bowed, but with a very uneasy air STOP "I think the Warden
was about to speak," he remarked, evidently anxious to change the
subject STOP But my Lady would not be checked STOP "He is a clever boy," she continued
with enthusiasm, "but he needs a man like your Lordship to draw him
out! STOP The Chancellor bit his lip, and was silent STOP He evidently feared that,
stupid as she looked, she understood what she said this time, and was
having a joke at his expense STOP He might have spared himself all anxiety:
whatever accidental meaning her words might have, she herself never
meant anything at all STOP "It is all settled! STOP the Warden announced, wasting no time over
preliminaries STOP "The Sub-Wardenship is abolished, and my brother is
appointed to act as Vice-Warden whenever I am absent STOP So, as I am going
abroad for a while, he will enter on his new duties at once. STOP "And there will really be a Vice after all? STOP my Lady enquired STOP "I hope so! STOP the Warden smilingly replied STOP My Lady looked much pleased, and tried to clap her hands: but you might
as well have knocked two feather-beds together, for any noise it made STOP "When my husband is Vice," she said, "it will be the same as if we had a
hundred Vices! STOP "Hear, hear! STOP cried the Sub-Warden STOP "You seem to think it very remarkable," my Lady remarked with some
severity, "that your wife should speak the truth! STOP "No, not remarkable at all! STOP her husband anxiously explained STOP "Nothing
is remarkable that you say, sweet one! STOP My Lady smiled approval of the sentiment, and went on STOP "And am I
Vice-Wardeness? STOP "If you choose to use that title," said the Warden: "but 'Your
Excellency' will be the proper style of address STOP And I trust that both
'His Excellency' and 'Her Excellency' will observe the Agreement I have
drawn up STOP The provision I am most anxious about is this. STOP He unrolled a
large parchment scroll, and read aloud the words "'item, that we will be
kind to the poor. STOP The Chancellor worded it for me," he added, glancing
at that great Functionary STOP "I suppose, now, that word 'item' has some
deep legal meaning? STOP "Undoubtedly! STOP replied the Chancellor, as articulately as he could with
a pen between his lips STOP He was nervously rolling and unrolling several
other scrolls, and making room among them for the one the Warden had
just handed to him STOP "These are merely the rough copies," he explained:
"and, as soon as I have put in the final corrections--" making a great
commotion among the different parchments, "--a semi-colon or two that I
have accidentally omitted--" here he darted about, pen in hand, from one
part of the scroll to another, spreading sheets of blotting-paper over
his corrections, "all will be ready for signing. STOP "Should it not be read out, first? STOP my Lady enquired STOP "No need, no need! STOP the Sub-Warden and the Chancellor exclaimed at the
same moment, with feverish eagerness STOP "No need at all," the Warden gently assented STOP "Your husband and I have
gone through it together STOP It provides that he shall exercise the full
authority of Warden, and shall have the disposal of the annual revenue
attached to the office, until my return, or, failing that, until Bruno
comes of age: and that he shall then hand over, to myself or to Bruno as
the case may be, the Wardenship, the unspent revenue, and the
contents of the Treasury, which are to be preserved, intact, under his
guardianship. STOP All this time the Sub-Warden was busy, with the Chancellor's help,
shifting the papers from side to side, and pointing out to the Warden
the place whew he was to sign STOP He then signed it himself, and my Lady
and the Chancellor added their names as witnesses STOP "Short partings are best," said the Warden STOP "All is ready for my
journey STOP My children are waiting below to see me off" He gravely kissed
my Lady, shook hands with his brother and the Chancellor, and left the
room STOP {Image...'What a game!' STOP The three waited in silence till the sound of wheels announced that the
Warden was out of hearing: then, to my surprise, they broke into peals
of uncontrollable laughter STOP "What a game, oh, what a game! STOP cried the Chancellor STOP And he and the
Vice-Warden joined hands, and skipped wildly about the room STOP My Lady was
too dignified to skip, but she laughed like the neighing of a horse, and
waved her handkerchief above her head: it was clear to her very limited
understanding that something very clever had been done, but what it was
she had yet to learn STOP "You said I should hear all about it when the Warden had gone," she
remarked, as soon as she could make herself heard STOP "And so you shall, Tabby! STOP her husband graciously replied, as he removed
the blotting-paper, and showed the two parchments lying side by side STOP "This is the one he read but didn't sign: and this is the one he signed
but didn't read STOP You see it was all covered up, except the place for
signing the names--"

"Yes, yes! STOP my Lady interrupted eagerly, and began comparing the two
Agreements STOP "'Item, that he shall exercise the authority of Warden, in the Warden's
absence. STOP Why, that's been changed into 'shall be absolute governor
for life, with the title of Emperor, if elected to that office by the
people. STOP What STOP Are you Emperor, darling? STOP "Not yet, dear," the Vice-Warden replied STOP "It won't do to let this paper
be seen, just at present STOP All in good time. STOP My Lady nodded, and read on STOP "'Item, that we will be kind to the poor. STOP Why, that's omitted altogether! STOP "Course it is! STOP said her husband STOP "We're not going to bother about the
wretches! STOP "Good," said my Lady, with emphasis, and read on again STOP "'Item, that the
contents of the Treasury be preserved intact. STOP Why, that's altered into
'shall be at the absolute disposal of the Vice-Warden' STOP Well, Sibby,
that was a clever trick STOP All the Jewels, only think STOP May I go and put
them on directly? STOP "Well, not just yet, Lovey," her husband uneasily replied STOP "You see the
public mind isn't quite ripe for it yet STOP We must feel our way STOP Of course
we'll have the coach-and-four out, at once STOP And I'll take the title of
Emperor, as soon as we can safely hold an Election STOP But they'll hardly
stand our using the Jewels, as long as they know the Warden's alive STOP We
must spread a report of his death STOP A little Conspiracy--"

"A Conspiracy! STOP cried the delighted lady, clapping her hands STOP "Of all
things, I do like a Conspiracy STOP It's so interesting! STOP The Vice-Warden and the Chancellor interchanged a wink or two STOP "Let
her conspire to her heart's content! STOP the cunning Chancellor whispered STOP "It'll do no harm! STOP "And when will the Conspiracy--"

"Hist STOP ', her husband hastily interrupted her, as the door opened, and
Sylvie and Bruno came in, with their arms twined lovingly round each
other--Bruno sobbing convulsively, with his face hidden on his sister's
shoulder, and Sylvie more grave and quiet, but with tears streaming down
her cheeks STOP "Mustn't cry like that! STOP the Vice-Warden said sharply, but without any
effect on the weeping children STOP "Cheer 'em up a bit! STOP he hinted to my
Lady STOP "Cake! STOP my Lady muttered to herself with great decision, crossing the
room and opening a cupboard, from which she presently returned with two
slices of plum-cake STOP "Eat, and don't cry! STOP were her short and simple
orders: and the poor children sat down side by side, but seemed in no
mood for eating STOP For the second time the door opened--or rather was burst open, this
time, as Uggug rushed violently into the room, shouting "that old
Beggars come again! STOP "He's not to have any food--" the Vice-warden was beginning, but the
Chancellor interrupted him STOP "It's all right," he said, in a low voice:
"the servants have their orders. STOP "He's just under here," said Uggug, who had gone to the window, and was
looking down into the court-yard STOP "Where, my darling? STOP said his fond mother, flinging her arms round the
neck of the little monster STOP All of us (except Sylvie and Bruno, who
took no notice of what was going on) followed her to the window STOP The old
Beggar looked up at us with hungry eyes STOP "Only a crust of bread, your
Highness! STOP he pleaded STOP {Image...'Drink this!' STOP He was a fine old man, but looked sadly ill and worn STOP "A crust of bread
is what I crave! STOP he repeated STOP "A single crust, and a little water! STOP "Here's some water, drink this! STOP Uggug bellowed, emptying a jug of water over his head STOP "Well done, my boy! STOP cried the Vice-Warden STOP "That's the way to settle such folk! STOP "Clever boy STOP ", the Wardeness chimed in STOP "Hasn't he good spirits? STOP "Take a stick to him! STOP shouted the Vice-Warden, as the old Beggar shook
the water from his ragged cloak, and again gazed meekly upwards STOP "Take a red-hot poker to him! STOP my Lady again chimed in STOP Possibly there was no red-hot poker handy: but some sticks were
forthcoming in a moment, and threatening faces surrounded the poor old
wanderer, who waved them back with quiet dignity STOP "No need to break my
old bones," he said STOP "I am going STOP Not even a crust! STOP "Poor, poor old man! STOP exclaimed a little voice at my side, half choked
with sobs STOP Bruno was at the window, trying to throw out his slice of
plum-cake, but Sylvie held him back STOP "He shalt have my cake! STOP Bruno cried, passionately struggling out of
Sylvie's arms STOP "Yes, yes, darling! STOP Sylvie gently pleaded STOP "But don't throw it out STOP He's gone away, don't you see STOP Let's go after him. STOP And she led him
out of the room, unnoticed by the rest of the party, who were wholly
absorbed in watching the old Beggar STOP The Conspirators returned to their seats, and continued their
conversation in an undertone, so as not to be heard by Uggug, who was
still standing at the window STOP "By the way, there was something about Bruno succeeding to the
Wrardenship," said my Lady STOP "How does that stand in the new Agreement? STOP The Chancellor chuckled STOP "Just the same, word for word," he said, "with
one exception, my Lady STOP Instead of 'Bruno,' I've taken the liberty to
put in--" he dropped his voice to a whisper, "to put in 'Uggug,' you
know! STOP "Uggug, indeed! STOP I exclaimed, in a burst of indignation I could no
longer control STOP To bring out even that one word seemed a gigantic
effort: but, the cry once uttered, all effort ceased at once: a sudden
gust swept away the whole scene, and I found myself sitting up, staring
at the young lady in the opposite corner of the carriage, who had now
thrown back her veil, and was looking at me with an expression of amused
surprise STOP  STOP A BEGGAR'S PALACE STOP That I had said something, in the act of waking, I felt sure: the hoarse
stifled cry was still ringing in my ears, even if the startled look
of my fellow-traveler had not been evidence enough: but what could I
possibly say by way of apology STOP "I hope I didn't frighten you? STOP I stammered out at last STOP "I have no idea
what I said STOP I was dreaming. STOP "You said 'Uggug indeed!' STOP the young lady replied, with quivering lips
that would curve themselves into a smile, in spite of all her efforts to
look grave STOP "At least--you didn't say it--you shouted it! STOP "I'm very sorry," was all I could say, feeling very penitent and
helpless STOP "She has Sylvie's eyes! STOP I thought to myself, half-doubting
whether, even now, I were fairly awake STOP "And that sweet look of innocent
wonder is all Sylvie's too STOP But Sylvie hasn't got that calm resolute
mouth nor that far-away look of dreamy sadness, like one that has had
some deep sorrow, very long ago--" And the thick-coming fancies almost
prevented my hearing the lady's next words STOP "If you had had a 'Shilling Dreadful' in your hand," she proceeded,
"something about Ghosts or Dynamite or Midnight Murder--one could
understand it: those things aren't worth the shilling, unless they give
one a Nightmare STOP But really--with only a medical treatise, you know--"
and she glanced, with a pretty shrug of contempt, at the book over which
I had fallen asleep STOP Her friendliness, and utter unreserve, took me aback for a moment; yet
there was no touch of forwardness, or boldness, about the child
for child, almost, she seemed to be: I guessed her at scarcely over
twenty--all was the innocent frankness of some angelic visitant, new
to the ways of earth and the conventionalisms or, if you will, the
barbarisms--of Society STOP "Even so," I mused, "will Sylvie look and speak,
in another ten years. STOP "You don't care for Ghosts, then," I ventured to suggest, "unless they
are really terrifying? STOP "Quite so," the lady assented STOP "The regular Railway-Ghosts--I mean the
Ghosts of ordinary Railway-literature--are very poor affairs STOP I feel
inclined to say, with Alexander Selkirk, 'Their tameness is shocking to
me' STOP And they never do any Midnight Murders STOP They couldn't 'welter in
gore,' to save their lives! STOP "'Weltering in gore' is a very expressive phrase, certainly STOP Can it be
done in any fluid, I wonder? STOP "I think not," the lady readily replied--quite as if she had thought it
out, long ago STOP "It has to be something thick STOP For instance, you might
welter in bread-sauce STOP That, being white, would be more suitable for a
Ghost, supposing it wished to welter! STOP "You have a real good terrifying Ghost in that book? STOP I hinted STOP "How could you guess? STOP she exclaimed with the most engaging frankness,
and placed the volume in my hands STOP I opened it eagerly, with a not
unpleasant thrill (like what a good ghost-story gives one) at the
'uncanny' coincidence of my having so unexpectedly divined the subject
of her studies STOP It was a book of Domestic Cookery, open at the article Bread Sauce. STOP I returned the book, looking, I suppose, a little blank, as the lady
laughed merrily at my discomfiture STOP "It's far more exciting than some
of the modern ghosts, I assure you STOP Now there was a Ghost last month--I
don't mean a real Ghost in in Supernature--but in a Magazine STOP It was
a perfectly flavourless Ghost STOP It wouldn't have frightened a mouse STOP It
wasn't a Ghost that one would even offer a chair to! STOP "Three score years and ten, baldness, and spectacles, have their
advantages after all STOP ", I said to myself STOP "Instead of a bashful youth
and maiden, gasping out monosyllables at awful intervals, here we have
an old man and a child, quite at their ease, talking as if they had
known each other for years STOP Then you think," I continued aloud, "that
we ought sometimes to ask a Ghost to sit down STOP But have we any authority
for it STOP In Shakespeare, for instance--there are plenty of ghosts
there--does Shakespeare ever give the stage-direction 'hands chair to
Ghost'? STOP The lady looked puzzled and thoughtful for a moment: then she almost
clapped her hands STOP "Yes, yes, he does! STOP she cried STOP "He makes Hamlet say
'Rest, rest, perturbed Spirit!" STOP "And that, I suppose, means an easy-chair? STOP "An American rocking-chair, I think--"

"Fayfield Junction, my Lady, change for Elveston! STOP the guard announced,
flinging open the door of the carriage: and we soon found ourselves,
with all our portable property around us, on the platform STOP The accommodation, provided for passengers waiting at this Junction, was
distinctly inadequate--a single wooden bench, apparently intended for
three sitters only: and even this was already partially occupied by
a very old man, in a smock frock, who sat, with rounded shoulders and
drooping head, and with hands clasped on the top of his stick so as to
make a sort of pillow for that wrinkled face with its look of patient
weariness STOP "Come, you be off! STOP the Station-master roughly accosted the poor old
man STOP "You be off, and make way for your betters STOP This way, my Lady! STOP he
added in a perfectly different tone STOP "If your Ladyship will take a seat,
the train will be up in a few minutes. STOP The cringing servility of his
manner was due, no doubt, to the address legible on the pile of luggage,
which announced their owner to be "Lady Muriel Orme, passenger to
Elveston, via Fayfield Junction. STOP As I watched the old man slowly rise to his feet, and hobble a few paces
down the platform, the lines came to my lips:--


    "From sackcloth couch the Monk arose,
    With toil his stiffen'd limbs he rear'd;
    A hundred years had flung their snows
    On his thin locks and floating beard. STOP {Image...'Come, you be off!' STOP But the lady scarcely noticed the little incident STOP After one glance
at the 'banished man,' who stood tremulously leaning on his stick, she
turned to me STOP "This is not an American rocking-chair, by any means STOP Yet may I say," slightly changing her place, so as to make room for me
beside her, "may I say, in Hamlet's words, 'Rest, rest--'" she broke off
with a silvery laugh.

 STOP --perturbed Spirit!" STOP I finished the sentence for her STOP "Yes, that
describes a railway-traveler exactly STOP And here is an instance of it," I
added, as the tiny local train drew up alongside the platform, and the
porters bustled about, opening carriage-doors--one of them helping the
poor old man to hoist himself into a third-class carriage, while another
of them obsequiously conducted the lady and myself into a first-class STOP She paused, before following him, to watch the progress of the other
passenger STOP "Poor old man! STOP she said STOP "How weak and ill he looks STOP It was
a shame to let him be turned away like that STOP I'm very sorry--" At this
moment it dawned on me that these words were not addressed to me, but
that she was unconsciously thinking aloud STOP I moved away a few steps,
and waited to follow her into the carriage, where I resumed the
conversation STOP "Shakespeare must have traveled by rail, if only in a dream: 'perturbed
Spirit' is such a happy phrase. STOP "'Perturbed' referring, no doubt," she rejoined, "to the sensational
booklets peculiar to the Rail STOP If Steam has done nothing else, it has at
least added a whole new Species to English Literature! STOP "No doubt of it," I echoed STOP "The true origin of all our medical
books--and all our cookery-books--"

"No, no! STOP she broke in merrily STOP "I didn't mean our Literature STOP We are
quite abnormal STOP But the booklets--the little thrilling romances, where
the Murder comes at page fifteen, and the Wedding at page forty--surely
they are due to Steam? STOP "And when we travel by Electricity if I may venture to develop your
theory we shall have leaflets instead of booklets, and the Murder and
the Wedding will come on the same page. STOP "A development worthy of Darwin STOP ", the lady exclaimed enthusiastically STOP "Only you reverse his theory STOP Instead of developing a mouse into an
elephant, you would develop an elephant into a mouse! STOP But here we
plunged into a tunnel, and I leaned back and closed my eyes for a
moment, trying to recall a few of the incidents of my recent dream STOP "I thought I saw--" I murmured sleepily: and then the phrase insisted
on conjugating itself, and ran into "you thought you saw--he thought he
saw--" and then it suddenly went off into a song:--


    "He thought he saw an Elephant,
    That practised on a fife:
    He looked again, and found it was
    A letter from his wife STOP 'At length I realise,' he said,
    "The bitterness of Life!' STOP And what a wild being it was who sang these wild words STOP A Gardener
he seemed to be yet surely a mad one, by the way he brandished his
rake--madder, by the way he broke, ever and anon, into a frantic
jig--maddest of all, by the shriek in which he brought out the last
words of the stanza STOP {Image....The gardener}

It was so far a description of himself that he had the feet of an
Elephant: but the rest of him was skin and bone: and the wisps of
loose straw, that bristled all about him, suggested that he had been
originally stuffed with it, and that nearly all the stuffing had come
out STOP Sylvie and Bruno waited patiently till the end of the first verse STOP Then
Sylvie advanced alone (Bruno having suddenly turned shy) and timidly
introduced herself with the words "Please, I'm Sylvie! STOP "And who's that other thing STOP ', said the Gardener STOP "What thing? STOP said Sylvie, looking round STOP "Oh, that's Bruno STOP He's my
brother. STOP "Was he your brother yesterday? STOP the Gardener anxiously enquired STOP "Course I were! STOP cried Bruno, who had gradually crept nearer, and
didn't at all like being talked about without having his share in the
conversation STOP "Ah, well! STOP the Gardener said with a kind of groan STOP "Things change so,
here STOP Whenever I look again, it's sure to be something different STOP Yet I
does my duty STOP I gets up wriggle-early at five--"

"If I was oo," said Bruno, "I wouldn't wriggle so early STOP It's as bad as
being a worm! STOP he added, in an undertone to Sylvie STOP "But you shouldn't be lazy in the morning, Bruno," said Sylvie STOP "Remember, it's the early bird that picks up the worm! STOP "It may, if it likes! STOP Bruno said with a slight yawn STOP "I don't like
eating worms, one bit STOP I always stop in bed till the early bird has
picked them up! STOP "I wonder you've the face to tell me such fibs! STOP cried the Gardener STOP To which Bruno wisely replied "Oo don't want a face to tell fibs
wiz--only a mouf. STOP Sylvie discreetly changed the subject STOP "And did you plant all these
flowers? STOP she said STOP "What a lovely garden you've made STOP Do you know, I'd like to live here
always! STOP "In the winter-nights--" the Gardener was beginning STOP "But I'd nearly forgotten what we came about! STOP Sylvie interrupted STOP "Would you please let us through into the road STOP There's a poor old
beggar just gone out--and he's very hungry--and Bruno wants to give him
his cake, you know! STOP "It's as much as my place is worth! STOP the Gardener muttered, taking a key
from his pocket, and beginning to unlock a door in the garden-wall STOP "How much are it wurf? STOP Bruno innocently enquired STOP But the Gardener only grinned STOP "That's a secret! STOP he said STOP "Mind you
come back quick! STOP he called after the children, as they passed out into
the road STOP I had just time to follow them, before he shut the door again STOP We hurried down the road, and very soon caught sight of the old Beggar,
about a quarter of a mile ahead of us, and the children at once set off
running to overtake him STOP Lightly and swiftly they skimmed over the ground, and I could not in
the least understand how it was I kept up with them so easily STOP But the
unsolved problem did not worry me so much as at another time it might
have done, there were so many other things to attend to STOP The old Beggar must have been very deaf, as he paid no attention
whatever to Bruno's eager shouting, but trudged wearily on, never
pausing until the child got in front of him and held up the slice of
cake STOP The poor little fellow was quite out of breath, and could only
utter the one word "Cake! STOP not with the gloomy decision with which
Her Excellency had so lately pronounced it, but with a sweet childish
timidity, looking up into the old man's face with eyes that loved 'all
things both great and small. STOP The old man snatched it from him, and devoured it greedily, as some
hungry wild beast might have done, but never a word of thanks did he
give his little benefactor--only growled "More, more! STOP and glared at the
half-frightened children STOP "There is no more STOP ", Sylvie said with tears in her eyes STOP "I'd eaten
mine STOP It was a shame to let you be turned away like that STOP I'm very
sorry--"

I lost the rest of the sentence, for my mind had recurred, with a great
shock of surprise, to Lady Muriel Orme, who had so lately uttered
these very words of Sylvie's--yes, and in Sylvie's own voice, and with
Sylvie's gentle pleading eyes STOP "Follow me! STOP were the next words I heard, as the old man waved his hand,
with a dignified grace that ill suited his ragged dress, over a bush,
that stood by the road side, which began instantly to sink into the
earth STOP At another time I might have doubted the evidence of my eyes,
or at least have felt some astonishment: but, in this strange scene, my
whole being seemed absorbed in strong curiosity as to what would happen
next STOP When the bush had sunk quite out of our sight, marble steps were seen,
leading downwards into darkness STOP The old man led the way, and we eagerly
followed STOP The staircase was so dark, at first, that I could only just see the
forms of the children, as, hand-in-hand, they groped their way down
after their guide: but it got lighter every moment, with a strange
silvery brightness, that seemed to exist in the air, as there were no
lamps visible; and, when at last we reached a level floor, the room, in
which we found ourselves, was almost as light as day STOP It was eight-sided, having in each angle a slender pillar, round which
silken draperies were twined STOP The wall between the pillars was entirely
covered, to the height of six or seven feet, with creepers, from which
hung quantities of ripe fruit and of brilliant flowers, that almost hid
the leaves STOP In another place, perchance, I might have wondered to see
fruit and flowers growing together: here, my chief wonder was that
neither fruit nor flowers were such as I had ever seen before STOP Higher
up, each wall contained a circular window of coloured glass; and over
all was an arched roof, that seemed to be spangled all over with jewels STOP With hardly less wonder, I turned this way and that, trying to make
out how in the world we had come in: for there was no door: and all the
walls were thickly covered with the lovely creepers STOP "We are safe here, my darlings! STOP said the old man, laying a hand on
Sylvie's shoulder, and bending down to kiss her STOP Sylvie drew back
hastily, with an offended air: but in another moment, with a glad cry of
"Why, it's Father STOP ", she had run into his arms STOP {Image...A beggar's palace}

"Father STOP Father! STOP Bruno repeated: and, while the happy children were
being hugged and kissed, I could but rub my eyes and say "Where, then,
are the rags gone to STOP "; for the old man was now dressed in royal robes
that glittered with jewels and gold embroidery, and wore a circlet of
gold around his head STOP  STOP THE MAGIC LOCKET STOP "Where are we, father? STOP Sylvie whispered, with her arms twined closely
around the old man's neck, and with her rosy cheek lovingly pressed to
his STOP "In Elfland, darling STOP It's one of the provinces of Fairyland. STOP "But I thought Elfland was ever so far from Outland: and we've come such
a tiny little way! STOP "You came by the Royal Road, sweet one STOP Only those of royal blood can
travel along it: but you've been royal ever since I was made King of
Elfland that's nearly a month ago STOP They sent two ambassadors, to make
sure that their invitation to me, to be their new King, should reach me STOP One was a Prince; so he was able to come by the Royal Road, and to come
invisibly to all but me: the other was a Baron; so he had to come by the
common road, and I dare say he hasn't even arrived yet. STOP "Then how far have we come? STOP Sylvie enquired STOP "Just a thousand miles, sweet one, since the Gardener unlocked that door
for you. STOP "A thousand miles! STOP Bruno repeated STOP "And may I eat one? STOP "Eat a mile, little rogue? STOP "No," said Bruno STOP "I mean may I eat one of that fruits? STOP "Yes, child," said his father: "and then you'll find out what Pleasure
is like--the Pleasure we all seek so madly, and enjoy so mournfully! STOP Bruno ran eagerly to the wall, and picked a fruit that was shaped
something like a banana, but had the colour of a strawberry STOP He ate it with beaming looks, that became gradually more gloomy, and
were very blank indeed by the time he had finished STOP "It hasn't got no taste at all! STOP he complained STOP "I couldn't feel nuffin
in my mouf STOP It's a--what's that hard word, Sylvie? STOP "It was a Phlizz," Sylvie gravely replied STOP "Are they all like that,
father? STOP "They're all like that to you, darling, because you don't belong to
Elfland--yet STOP But to me they are real. STOP Bruno looked puzzled STOP "I'll try anuvver kind of fruits! STOP he said, and
jumped down off the King's knee STOP "There's some lovely striped ones, just
like a rainbow! STOP And off he ran STOP Meanwhile the Fairy-King and Sylvie were talking together, but in such
low tones that I could not catch the words: so I followed Bruno, who
was picking and eating other kinds of fruit, in the vain hope of finding
some that had a taste STOP I tried to pick so me myself--but it was like
grasping air, and I soon gave up the attempt and returned to Sylvie STOP "Look well at it, my darling," the old man was saying, "and tell me how
you like it. STOP "'It's just lovely," cried Sylvie, delightedly STOP "Bruno, come and
look! STOP And she held up, so that he might see the light through it, a
heart-shaped Locket, apparently cut out of a single jewel, of a rich
blue colour, with a slender gold chain attached to it STOP "It are welly pretty," Bruno more soberly remarked: and he began
spelling out some words inscribed on it STOP "All--will--love--Sylvie," he
made them out at last STOP "And so they doos! STOP he cried, clasping his arms
round her neck STOP "Everybody loves Sylvie! STOP "But we love her best, don't we, Bruno? STOP said the old King, as he took
possession of the Locket STOP "Now, Sylvie, look at this. STOP And he showed
her, lying on the palm of his hand, a Locket of a deep crimson colour,
the same shape as the blue one and, like it, attached to a slender
golden chain STOP "Lovelier and lovelier! STOP exclaimed Sylvie, clasping her hands in
ecstasy STOP "Look, Bruno! STOP "And there's words on this one, too," said Bruno STOP "Sylvie--will--love--all. STOP "Now you see the difference," said the old man: "different colours and
different words. STOP "Choose one of them, darling STOP I'll give you which ever you like best. STOP {Image...The crimson locket}

Sylvie whispered the words, several times over, with a thoughtful smile,
and then made her decision STOP "It's very nice to be loved," she said: "but
it's nicer to love other people STOP May I have the red one, Father? STOP The old man said nothing: but I could see his eyes fill with tears, as
he bent his head and pressed his lips to her forehead in a long loving
kiss STOP Then he undid the chain, and showed her how to fasten it round her
neck, and to hide it away under the edge of her frock STOP "It's for you
to keep you know he said in a low voice, not for other people to see STOP You'll remember how to use it? STOP "Yes, I'll remember," said Sylvie STOP "And now darlings it's time for you to go back or they'll be missing you
and then that poor Gardener will get into trouble! STOP Once more a feeling of wonder rose in my mind as to how in the world we
were to get back again--since I took it for granted that wherever the
children went I was to go--but no shadow of doubt seemed to cross
their minds as they hugged and kissed him murmuring over and over again
"Good-bye darling Father! STOP And then suddenly and swiftly the darkness
of midnight seemed to close in upon us and through the darkness harshly
rang a strange wild song:--


    He thought he saw a Buffalo
    Upon the chimney-piece:
    He looked again, and found it was
    His Sister's Husband's Niece STOP 'Unless you leave this house,' he said,
    'I'll send for the Police! STOP {Image...'He thought he saw a buffalo'}

"That was me! STOP he added, looking out at us, through the half-opened
door, as we stood waiting in the road. STOP "And that's what I'd have
done--as sure as potatoes aren't radishes--if she hadn't have tooken
herself off STOP But I always loves my pay-rints like anything. STOP "Who are oor pay-rints? STOP said Bruno STOP "Them as pay rint for me, a course! STOP the Gardener replied STOP "You can come
in now, if you like. STOP He flung the door open as he spoke, and we got out, a little dazzled
and stupefied (at least I felt so) at the sudden transition from
the half-darkness of the railway-carriage to the brilliantly-lighted
platform of Elveston Station STOP A footman, in a handsome livery, came forwards and respectfully touched
his hat STOP "The carriage is here, my Lady," he said, taking from her
the wraps and small articles she was carrying: and Lady Muriel, after
shaking hands and bidding me "Good-night! STOP with a pleasant smile,
followed him STOP It was with a somewhat blank and lonely feeling that I betook myself to
the van from which the luggage was being taken out: and, after giving
directions to have my boxes sent after me, I made my way on foot to
Arthur's lodgings, and soon lost my lonely feeling in the hearty welcome
my old friend gave me, and the cozy warmth and cheerful light of the
little sitting-room into which he led me STOP "Little, as you see, but quite enough for us two STOP Now, take the
easy-chair, old fellow, and let's have another look at you STOP Well, you
do look a bit pulled down! STOP and he put on a solemn professional air STOP "I prescribe Ozone, quant STOP suff STOP Social dissipation, fiant pilulae quam
plurimae: to be taken, feasting, three times a day! STOP "But, Doctor! STOP I remonstrated STOP "Society doesn't 'receive' three times a
day! STOP "That's all you know about it! STOP the young Doctor gaily replied STOP "At
home, lawn-tennis, 3 P.M. At home, kettledrum, 5 P.M. At home, music
(Elveston doesn't give dinners), 8 P.M. Carriages at 10 STOP There you are! STOP It sounded very pleasant, I was obliged to admit STOP "And I know some
of the lady-society already," I added STOP "One of them came in the same
carriage with me. STOP "What was she like STOP Then perhaps I can identify her. STOP "The name was Lady Muriel Orme STOP As to what she was like--well, I thought
her very beautiful STOP Do you know her? STOP "Yes--I do know her. STOP And the grave Doctor coloured slightly as he added
"Yes, I agree with you STOP She is beautiful. STOP "I quite lost my heart to her! STOP I went on mischievously STOP "We talked--"

"Have some supper! STOP Arthur interrupted with an air of relief, as the
maid entered with the tray STOP And he steadily resisted all my attempts to
return to the subject of Lady Muriel until the evening had almost worn
itself away STOP Then, as we sat gazing into the fire, and conversation was
lapsing into silence, he made a hurried confession STOP "I hadn't meant to tell you anything about her," he said (naming no
names, as if there were only one 'she' in the world! STOP "till you had
seen more of her, and formed your own judgment of her: but somehow you
surprised it out of me STOP And I've not breathed a word of it to any one
else STOP But I can trust you with a secret, old friend STOP Yes STOP It's true of
me, what I suppose you said in jest STOP "In the merest jest, believe me! STOP I said earnestly STOP "Why, man, I'm three
times her age STOP But if she's your choice, then I'm sure she's all that is
good and--"

"--and sweet," Arthur went on, "and pure, and self-denying, and
true-hearted, and--" he broke off hastily, as if he could not trust
himself to say more on a subject so sacred and so precious STOP Silence
followed: and I leaned back drowsily in my easy-chair, filled with
bright and beautiful imaginings of Arthur and his lady-love, and of all
the peace and happiness in store for them STOP I pictured them to myself walking together, lingeringly and lovingly,
under arching trees, in a sweet garden of their own, and welcomed back
by their faithful gardener, on their return from some brief excursion STOP It seemed natural enough that the gardener should be filled with
exuberant delight at the return of so gracious a master and mistress and
how strangely childlike they looked STOP I could have taken them for Sylvie
and Bruno less natural that he should show it by such wild dances, such
crazy songs STOP "He thought he saw a Rattlesnake
    That questioned him in Greek:
    He looked again, and found it was
    The Middle of Next Week STOP 'The one thing I regret,' he said,
    'Is that it cannot speak! STOP --least natural of all that the Vice-Warden and 'my Lady' should be
standing close beside me, discussing an open letter, which had just been
handed to him by the Professor, who stood, meekly waiting, a few yards
off STOP "If it were not for those two brats," I heard him mutter, glancing
savagely at Sylvie and Bruno, who were courteously listening to the
Gardener's song, "there would be no difficulty whatever. STOP "Let's hear that bit of the letter again," said my Lady STOP And the
Vice-Warden read aloud:--

"--and we therefore entreat you graciously to accept the Kingship, to
which you have been unanimously elected by the Council of Elfland: and
that you will allow your son Bruno of whose goodness, cleverness, and
beauty, reports have reached us--to be regarded as Heir-Apparent. STOP "But what's the difficulty? STOP said my Lady STOP "Why, don't you see STOP The Ambassador, that brought this, is waiting in
the house: and he's sure to see Sylvie and Bruno: and then, when he sees
Uggug, and remembers all that about 'goodness, cleverness, and beauty,'
why, he's sure to--"

"And where will you find a better boy than Uggug? STOP my Lady indignantly
interrupted STOP "Or a wittier, or a lovelier? STOP To all of which the Vice-Warden simply replied "Don't you be a great
blethering goose STOP Our only chance is to keep those two brats out of
sight STOP If you can manage that, you may leave the rest to me STOP I'll make
him believe Uggug to be a model of cleverness and all that. STOP "We must change his name to Bruno, of course? STOP said my Lady STOP The Vice-Warden rubbed his chin STOP "Humph STOP No! STOP he said musingly STOP "Wouldn't do STOP The boy's such an utter idiot, he'd never learn to answer
to it. STOP "Idiot, indeed! STOP cried my Lady STOP "He's no more an idiot than I am! STOP "You're right, my dear," the Vice-Warden soothingly I replied STOP "He
isn't, indeed! STOP My Lady was appeased STOP "Let's go in and receive the Ambassador," she
said, and beckoned to the Professor STOP "Which room is he waiting in? STOP she
inquired STOP "In the Library, Madam. STOP "And what did you say his name was? STOP said the Vice-Warden STOP The Professor referred to a card he held in his hand STOP "His Adiposity the
Baron Doppelgeist. STOP "Why does he come with such a funny name? STOP said my Lady STOP "He couldn't well change it on the journey," the Professor meekly
replied, "because of the luggage. STOP "You go and receive him," my Lady said to the Vice-Warden, "and I'll
attend to the children. STOP  STOP THE BARONS EMBASSY STOP I was following the Vice-Warden, but, on second thoughts, went after my
Lady, being curious to see how she would manage to keep the children out
of sight STOP I found her holding Sylvie's hand, and with her other hand stroking
Bruno's hair in a most tender and motherly fashion: both children were
looking bewildered and half-frightened STOP "My own darlings," she was saying, "I've been planning a little treat
for you STOP The Professor shall take you a long walk into the woods this
beautiful evening: and you shall take a basket of food with you, and
have a little picnic down by the river! STOP Bruno jumped, and clapped his hands STOP "That are nice! STOP he cried STOP "Aren't
it, Sylvie? STOP Sylvie, who hadn't quite lost her surprised look, put up her mouth for a
kiss STOP "Thank you very much," she said earnestly STOP My Lady turned her head away to conceal the broad grin of triumph that
spread over her vast face, like a ripple on a lake STOP "Little simpletons! STOP she muttered to herself, as she marched up to the house STOP I followed her
in STOP "Quite so, your Excellency," the Baron was saying as we entered the
Library STOP "All the infantry were under my command. STOP He turned, and was
duly presented to my Lady STOP "A military hero? STOP said my Lady STOP The fat little man simpered STOP "Well,
yes," he replied, modestly casting down his eyes STOP "My ancestors were all
famous for military genius. STOP My Lady smiled graciously STOP "It often runs in families," she remarked:
"just as a love for pastry does. STOP The Baron looked slightly offended, and the Vice-Warden discreetly
changed the subject STOP "Dinner will soon be ready," he said STOP "May I have
the honour of conducting your Adiposity to the guest-chamber? STOP "Certainly, certainly! STOP the Baron eagerly assented STOP "It would never do
to keep dinner waiting! STOP And he almost trotted out of the room after the
Vice-Warden STOP He was back again so speedily that the Vice-warden had barely time
to explain to my Lady that her remark about "a love for pastry" was
"unfortunate STOP You might have seen, with half an eye," he added, "that
that's his line STOP Military genius, indeed STOP Pooh! STOP "Dinner ready yet? STOP the Baron enquired, as he hurried into the room STOP "Will be in a few minutes," the Vice-Warden replied STOP "Meanwhile, let's
take a turn in the garden STOP You were telling me," he continued, as the
trio left the house, "something about a great battle in which you had
the command of the infantry--"

"True," said the Baron STOP "The enemy, as I was saying, far outnumbered
us: but I marched my men right into the middle of--what's that? STOP the
Military Hero exclaimed in agitated tones, drawing back behind the
Vice-Warden, as a strange creature rushed wildly upon them, brandishing
a spade STOP "It's only the Gardener! STOP the Vice-Warden replied in an encouraging
tone STOP "Quite harmless, I assure you STOP Hark, he's singing STOP Its his
favorite amusement. STOP And once more those shrill discordant tones rang out:--


    "He thought he saw a Banker's Clerk
    Descending from the bus:
    He looked again, and found it was
    A Hippopotamus:
    'If this should stay to dine,' he said,
    'There won't be mutch for us!' STOP Throwing away the spade, he broke into a frantic jig, snapping his
fingers, and repeating, again and again,


    "There won't be much for us STOP There won't be much for us! STOP {Image...It was a hippoptamus}

Once more the Baron looked slightly offended, but the Vice-Warden
hastily explained that the song had no allusion to him, and in fact had
no meaning at all STOP "You didn't mean anything by it, now did you? STOP He appealed to the Gardener, who had finished his song, and stood,
balancing himself on one leg, and looking at them, with his mouth open STOP "I never means nothing," said the Gardener: and Uggug luckily came up at
the moment, and gave the conversation a new turn STOP "Allow me to present my son," said the Vice-warden; adding, in a
whisper, "one of the best and cleverest boys that ever lived STOP I'll
contrive for you to see some of his cleverness STOP He knows everything that
other boys don't know; and in archery, in fishing, in painting, and
in music, his skill is--but you shall judge for yourself STOP You see that
target over there STOP He shall shoot an arrow at it STOP Dear boy," he went on
aloud, "his Adiposity would like to see you shoot STOP Bring his Highness'
bow and arrows! STOP Uggug looked very sulky as he received the bow and arrow, and prepared
to shoot STOP Just as the arrow left the bow, the Vice-Warden trod heavily
on the toe of the Baron, who yelled with the pain STOP "Ten thousand pardons! STOP he exclaimed STOP "I stepped back in my excitement STOP See STOP It is a bull's-eye! STOP The Baron gazed in astonishment STOP "He held the bow so awkwardly, it
seemed impossible! STOP he muttered STOP But there was no room for doubt: there
was the arrow, right in the centre of the bull's-eye STOP "The lake is close by," continued the Vice-warden STOP "Bring his Highness'
fishing-rod! STOP And Uggug most unwillingly held the rod, and dangled the
fly over the water STOP "A beetle on your arm! STOP cried my Lady, pinching the poor Baron's
arm worse than if ten lobsters had seized it at once STOP "That kind is
poisonous," she explained STOP "But what a pity STOP You missed seeing the fish
pulled out! STOP An enormous dead cod-fish was lying on the bank, with the hook in its
mouth STOP "I had always fancied," the Baron faltered, "that cod were salt-water
fish? STOP "Not in this country," said the Vice-Warden STOP "Shall we go in STOP Ask my son
some question on the way any subject you like! STOP And the sulky boy was
violently shoved forwards, to walk at the Baron's side STOP "Could your Highness tell me," the Baron cautiously began, "how much
seven times nine would come to? STOP "Turn to the left! STOP cried the Vice-Warden, hastily stepping forwards to
show the way---so hastily, that he ran against his unfortunate guest,
who fell heavily on his face STOP "So sorry! STOP my Lady exclaimed, as she and her husband helped him to his
feet again STOP "My son was in the act of saying 'sixty-three' as you fell! STOP The Baron said nothing: he was covered with dust, and seemed much hurt,
both in body and mind STOP However, when they had got him into the house,
and given him a good brushing, matters looked a little better STOP Dinner was served in due course, and every fresh dish seemed to increase
the good-humour of the Baron: but all efforts, to get him to express his
opinion as to Uggug's cleverness, were in vain, until that interesting
youth had left the room, and was seen from the open window, prowling
about the lawn with a little basket, which he was filling with frogs STOP "So fond of Natural History as he is, dear boy! STOP said the doting mother STOP "Now do tell us, Baron, what you think of him! STOP "To be perfectly candid," said the cautious Baron, "I would like a
little more evidence STOP I think you mentioned his skill in--"

"Music? STOP said the Vice-Warden STOP "Why, he's simply a prodigy STOP You shall
hear him play the piano. STOP And he walked to the window STOP "Ug--I mean my
boy STOP Come in for a minute, and bring the music-master with you STOP To turn
over the music for him," he added as an explanation STOP Uggug, having filled his basket with frogs, had no objection to obey,
and soon appeared in the room, followed by a fierce-looking little man,
who asked the Vice-Warden "Vot music vill you haf? STOP "The Sonata that His Highness plays so charmingly," said the
Vice-Warden STOP "His Highness haf not--" the music-master began, but was
sharply stopped by the Vice-warden STOP "Silence, Sir STOP Go and turn over the music for his Highness STOP My dear,"
(to the Wardeness) "will you show him what to do STOP And meanwhile, Baron,
I'll just show you a most interesting map we have--of Outland, and
Fairyland, and that sort of thing. STOP By the time my Lady had returned, from explaining things to the
music-master, the map had been hung up, and the Baron was already much
bewildered by the Vice-Warden's habit of pointing to one place while he
shouted out the name of another STOP {Image...The map of fairyland}

My Lady joining in, pointing out other places, and shouting other names,
only made matters worse; and at last the Baron, in despair, took to
pointing out places for himself, and feebly asked "Is that great yellow
splotch Fairyland? STOP "Yes, that's Fairyland," said the Vice-warden: "and you might as well
give him a hint," he muttered to my Lady, "about going back to-morrow STOP He eats like a shark STOP It would hardly do for me to mention it. STOP His wife caught the idea, and at once began giving hints of the most
subtle and delicate kind STOP "Just see what a short way it is back to
Fairyland STOP Why, if you started to-morrow morning, you'd get there in
very little more than a week! STOP The Baron looked incredulous STOP "It took me a full month to come," he
said STOP "But it's ever so much shorter, going back, you know! STOP The Baron looked appealingly to the Vice-warden, who chimed in readily STOP "You can go back five times, in the time it took you to come here
once--if you start to-morrow morning! STOP All this time the Sonata was pealing through the room STOP The Baron could
not help admitting to himself that it was being magnificently played:
but he tried in vain to get a glimpse of the youthful performer STOP Every
time he had nearly succeeded in catching sight of him, either the
Vice-Warden or his wife was sure to get in the way, pointing out some
new place on the map, and deafening him with some new name STOP He gave in at last, wished a hasty good-night, and left the room, while
his host and hostess interchanged looks of triumph STOP "Deftly done! STOP cried the Vice-Warden STOP "Craftily contrived STOP But what
means all that tramping on the stairs? STOP He half-opened the door, looked
out, and added in a tone of dismay, "The Baron's boxes are being carried
down! STOP "And what means all that rumbling of wheels? STOP cried my Lady STOP She peeped
through the window curtains STOP "The Baron's carriage has come round! STOP she
groaned STOP At this moment the door opened: a fat, furious face looked in: a
voice, hoarse with passion, thundered out the words "My room is full of
frogs--I leave you STOP ": and the door closed again STOP And still the noble Sonata went pealing through the room: but it was
Arthur's masterly touch that roused the echoes, and thrilled my very
soul with the tender music of the immortal 'Sonata Pathetique': and
it was not till the last note had died away that the tired but happy
traveler could bring himself to utter the words "good-night! STOP and to
seek his much-needed pillow STOP  STOP A RIDE ON A LION STOP The next day glided away, pleasantly enough, partly in settling myself
in my new quarters, and partly in strolling round the neighbourhood,
under Arthur's guidance, and trying to form a general idea of Elveston
and its inhabitants STOP When five o'clock arrived, Arthur proposed without
any embarrassment this time--to take me with him up to 'the Hall,' in
order that I might make acquaintance with the Earl of Ainslie, who had
taken it for the season, and renew acquaintance with his daughter Lady
Muriel STOP My first impressions of the gentle, dignified, and yet genial old man
were entirely favourable: and the real satisfaction that showed itself
on his daughter's face, as she met me with the words "this is indeed
an unlooked-for pleasure STOP ", was very soothing for whatever remains of
personal vanity the failures and disappointments of many long years, and
much buffeting with a rough world, had left in me STOP Yet I noted, and was glad to note, evidence of a far deeper feeling than
mere friendly regard, in her meeting with Arthur though this was, as I
gathered, an almost daily occurrence--and the conversation between them,
in which the Earl and I were only occasional sharers, had an ease and a
spontaneity rarely met with except between very old friends: and, as
I knew that they had not known each other for a longer period than the
summer which was now rounding into autumn, I felt certain that 'Love,'
and Love alone, could explain the phenomenon STOP "How convenient it would be," Lady Muriel laughingly remarked, a propos
of my having insisted on saving her the trouble of carrying a cup of tea
across the room to the Earl, "if cups of tea had no weight at all STOP Then
perhaps ladies would sometimes be permitted to carry them for short
distances! STOP "One can easily imagine a situation," said Arthur, "where things would
necessarily have no weight, relatively to each other, though each would
have its usual weight, looked at by itself. STOP "Some desperate paradox! STOP said the Earl STOP "Tell us how it could be STOP We
shall never guess it. STOP "Well, suppose this house, just as it is, placed a few billion miles
above a planet, and with nothing else near enough to disturb it: of
course it falls to the planet? STOP The Earl nodded STOP "Of course though it might take some centuries to do
it. STOP "And is five-o'clock-tea to be going on all the while? STOP said Lady
Muriel STOP "That, and other things," said Arthur STOP "The inhabitants would live their
lives, grow up and die, and still the house would be falling, falling,
falling STOP But now as to the relative weight of things STOP Nothing can be
heavy, you know, except by trying to fall, and being prevented from
doing so STOP You all grant that? STOP We all granted that STOP "Well, now, if I take this book, and hold it out at arm's length, of
course I feel its weight STOP It is trying to fall, and I prevent it STOP And, if I let go, it fails to the floor STOP But, if we were all falling
together, it couldn't be trying to fall any quicker, you know: for, if
I let go, what more could it do than fall STOP And, as my hand would be
falling too--at the same rate--it would never leave it, for that would
be to get ahead of it in the race STOP And it could never overtake the
failing floor! STOP "I see it clearly," said Lady Muriel STOP "But it makes one dizzy to think
of such things STOP How can you make us do it? STOP "There is a more curious idea yet," I ventured to say STOP "Suppose a cord
fastened to the house, from below, and pulled down by some one on the
planet STOP Then of course the house goes faster than its natural rate of
falling: but the furniture--with our noble selves--would go on failing
at their old pace, and would therefore be left behind. STOP "Practically, we should rise to the ceiling," said the Earl STOP "The
inevitable result of which would be concussion of brain. STOP "To avoid that," said Arthur, "let us have the furniture fixed to
the floor, and ourselves tied down to the furniture STOP Then the
five-o'clock-tea could go on in peace. STOP "With one little drawback! STOP Lady Muriel gaily interrupted STOP "We should
take the cups down with us: but what about the tea? STOP "I had forgotten the tea," Arthur confessed STOP "That, no doubt, would rise
to the ceiling unless you chose to drink it on the way! STOP "Which, I think, is quite nonsense enough for one while! STOP said the Earl STOP "What news does this gentleman bring us from the great world of London? STOP This drew me into the conversation, which now took a more conventional
tone STOP After a while, Arthur gave the signal for our departure, and in
the cool of the evening we strolled down to the beach, enjoying the
silence, broken only by the murmur of the sea and the far-away music of
some fishermen's song, almost as much as our late pleasant talk STOP We sat down among the rocks, by a little pool, so rich in animal,
vegetable, and zoophytic--or whatever is the right word--life, that I
became entranced in the study of it, and, when Arthur proposed returning
to our lodgings, I begged to be left there for a while, to watch and
muse alone STOP The fishermen's song grew ever nearer and clearer, as their boat stood
in for the beach; and I would have gone down to see them land their
cargo of fish, had not the microcosm at my feet stirred my curiosity yet
more keenly STOP One ancient crab, that was for ever shuffling frantically from side to
side of the pool, had particularly fascinated me: there was a vacancy in
its stare, and an aimless violence in its behaviour, that irresistibly
recalled the Gardener who had befriended Sylvie and Bruno: and, as I
gazed, I caught the concluding notes of the tune of his crazy song STOP The silence that followed was broken by the sweet voice of Sylvie STOP "Would you please let us out into the road? STOP "What STOP After that old beggar again? STOP the Gardener yelled, and began
singing:--


    "He thought he saw a Kangaroo
    That worked a coffee-mill:
    He looked again, and found it was
    A Vegetable-pill
    'Were I to swallow this,' he said,
    'I should be very ill!' STOP {Image...He thought he saw a kangaroo}

"We don't want him to swallow anything," Sylvie explained STOP "He's not
hungry STOP But we want to see him STOP So Will you please--"

"Certainly! STOP the Gardener promptly replied STOP "I always please STOP Never
displeases nobody STOP There you are! STOP And he flung the door open, and let
us out upon the dusty high-road STOP We soon found our way to the bush, which had so mysteriously sunk into
the ground: and here Sylvie drew the Magic Locket from its hiding-place,
turned it over with a thoughtful air, and at last appealed to Bruno in a
rather helpless way STOP "What was it we had to do with it, Bruno STOP It's all
gone out of my head! STOP "Kiss it! STOP was Bruno's invariable recipe in cases of doubt and
difficulty STOP Sylvie kissed it, but no result followed STOP "Rub it the wrong way," was Bruno's next suggestion STOP "Which is the wrong way STOP ", Sylvie most reasonably enquired STOP The obvious
plan was to try both ways STOP Rubbing from left to right had no visible effect whatever STOP From right to left--"Oh, stop, Sylvie! STOP Bruno cried in sudden alarm STOP "Whatever is going to happen? STOP For a number of trees, on the neighbouring hillside, were moving slowly
upwards, in solemn procession: while a mild little brook, that had been
rippling at our feet a moment before, began to swell, and foam, and
hiss, and bubble, in a truly alarming fashion STOP "Rub it some other way! STOP cried Bruno STOP "Try up-and-down STOP Quick! STOP It was a happy thought STOP Up-and-down did it: and the landscape, which had
been showing signs of mental aberration in various directions, returned
to its normal condition of sobriety with the exception of a small
yellowish-brown mouse, which continued to run wildly up and down the
road, lashing its tail like a little lion STOP "Let's follow it," said Sylvie: and this also turned out a happy
thought STOP The mouse at once settled down into a business-like jog-trot,
with which we could easily keep pace STOP The only phenomenon, that gave
me any uneasiness, was the rapid increase in the size of the little
creature we were following, which became every moment more and more like
a real lion STOP Soon the transformation was complete: and a noble lion stood patiently
waiting for us to come up with it STOP No thought of fear seemed to occur
to the children, who patted and stroked it as if it had been a
Shetland-pony STOP {Image...The mouse-lion}

"Help me up! STOP cried Bruno STOP And in another moment Sylvie had lifted him
upon the broad back of the gentle beast, and seated herself behind him,
pillion-fashion STOP Bruno took a good handful of mane in each hand, and
made believe to guide this new kind of steed STOP "Gee-up STOP ', seemed quite
sufficient by way of verbal direction: the lion at once broke into an
easy canter, and we soon found ourselves in the depths of the forest STOP I
say 'we,' for I am certain that I accompanied them though how I managed
to keep up with a cantering lion I am wholly unable to explain STOP But
I was certainly one of the party when we came upon an old beggar-man
cutting sticks, at whose feet the lion made a profound obeisance, Sylvie
and Bruno at the same moment dismounting, and leaping in to the arms of
their father STOP "From bad to worse! STOP the old man said to himself, dreamily, when the
children had finished their rather confused account of the Ambassador's
visit, gathered no doubt from general report, as they had not seen him
themselves STOP "From bad to worse STOP That is their destiny STOP I see it, but
I cannot alter it STOP The selfishness of a mean and crafty man--the
selfishness of an ambitious and silly woman----the selfishness of a
spiteful and loveless child all tend one way, from bad to worse STOP And
you, my darlings, must suffer it awhile, I fear STOP Yet, when things are at
their worst, you can come to me STOP I can do but little as yet--"

Gathering up a handful of dust and scattering it in the air, he slowly
and solemnly pronounced some words that sounded like a charm, the
children looking on in awe-struck silence:--


    "Let craft, ambition, spite,
    Be quenched in Reason's night,
    Till weakness turn to might,
    Till what is dark be light,
    Till what is wrong be right! STOP The cloud of dust spread itself out through the air, as if it were
alive, forming curious shapes that were for ever changing into others STOP "It makes letters STOP It makes words! STOP Bruno whispered, as he clung,
half-frightened, to Sylvie STOP "Only I ca'n't make them out STOP Read them,
Sylvie! STOP "I'll try," Sylvie gravely replied STOP "Wait a minute--if only I could see
that word--"

"I should be very ill STOP ', a discordant voice yelled in our ears STOP "Were I to swallow this,' he said,
    'I should be very ill!' STOP  STOP A JESTER AND A BEAR STOP Yes, we were in the garden once more: and, to escape that horrid
discordant voice, we hurried indoors, and found ourselves in the
library--Uggug blubbering, the Professor standing by with a bewildered
air, and my Lady, with her arms clasped round her son's neck, repeating,
over and over again, "and did they give him nasty lessons to learn STOP My
own pretty pet! STOP "What's all this noise about? STOP the Vice-warden angrily enquired, as he
strode into the room STOP "And who put the hat-stand here? STOP And he hung his hat up on Bruno, who was standing in the middle of the
room, too much astonished by the sudden change of scene to make any
attempt at removing it, though it came down to his shoulders, making him
look something like a small candle with a large extinguisher over it STOP The Professor mildly explained that His Highness had been graciously
pleased to say he wouldn't do his lessons STOP "Do your lessons this instant, you young cub! STOP thundered the
Vice-Warden STOP "And take this! STOP and a resounding box on the ear made the
unfortunate Professor reel across the room STOP "Save me! STOP faltered the poor old man, as he sank, half-fainting, at my
Lady's feet STOP "Shave you STOP Of course I will! STOP my Lady replied, as she lifted him into a
chair, and pinned an anti-macassar round his neck STOP "Where's the razor? STOP The Vice-Warden meanwhile had got hold of Uggug, and was belabouring him
with his umbrella STOP "Who left this loose nail in the floor? STOP he shouted,
"Hammer it in, I say STOP Hammer it in! STOP Blow after blow fell on the
writhing Uggug, till he dropped howling to the floor STOP {Image...'Hammer it in!' STOP Then his father turned to the 'shaving' scene which was being enacted,
and roared with laughter STOP "Excuse me, dear, I ca'n't help it! STOP he said
as soon as he could speak STOP "You are such an utter donkey STOP Kiss me,
Tabby! STOP And he flung his arms round the neck of the terrified Professor, who
raised a wild shriek, but whether he received the threatened kiss or
not I was unable to see, as Bruno, who had by this time released himself
from his extinguisher, rushed headlong out of the room, followed by
Sylvie; and I was so fearful of being left alone among all these crazy
creatures that I hurried after them STOP "We must go to Father! STOP Sylvie panted, as they ran down the garden STOP "I'm sure things are at their worst STOP I'll ask the Gardener to let us out
again. STOP "But we ca'n't walk all the way! STOP Bruno whimpered STOP "How I wiss we had a
coach-and-four, like Uncle! STOP And, shrill and wild, rang through the air the familiar voice:--


    "He thought he saw a Coach-and-Four
    That stood beside his bed:
    He looked again, and found it was
    A Bear without a Head STOP 'Poor thing,' he said, 'poor silly thing STOP It's waiting to be fed!' STOP {Image...A bear without a head}

"No, I ca'n't let you out again! STOP he said, before the children could
speak STOP "The Vice-warden gave it me, he did, for letting you out last
time STOP So be off with you! STOP And, turning away from them, he began digging
frantically in the middle of a gravel-walk, singing, over and over
again, "'Poor thing,' he said, 'poor silly thing STOP It's waiting to be
fed!' STOP but in a more musical tone than the shrill screech in which he
had begun STOP The music grew fuller and richer at every moment: other manly voices
joined in the refrain: and soon I heard the heavy thud that told me the
boat had touched the beach, and the harsh grating of the shingle as the
men dragged it up STOP I roused myself, and, after lending them a hand in
hauling up their boat, I lingered yet awhile to watch them disembark a
goodly assortment of the hard-won 'treasures of the deep. STOP When at last I reached our lodgings I was tired and sleepy, and glad
enough to settle down again into the easy-chair, while Arthur hospitably
went to his cupboard, to get me out some cake and wine, without which,
he declared, he could not, as a doctor, permit my going to bed STOP And how that cupboard-door did creak STOP It surely could not be Arthur, who
was opening and shutting it so often, moving so restlessly about, and
muttering like the soliloquy of a tragedy-queen STOP No, it was a female voice STOP Also the figure half-hidden by the
cupboard-door--was a female figure, massive, and in flowing robes STOP Could it be the landlady STOP The door opened, and a strange man entered the
room STOP "What is that donkey doing? STOP he said to himself, pausing, aghast, on the
threshold STOP The lady, thus rudely referred to, was his wife STOP She had got one of the
cupboards open, and stood with her back to him, smoothing down a sheet
of brown paper on one of the shelves, and whispering to herself "So, so STOP Deftly done STOP Craftily contrived! STOP Her loving husband stole behind her on tiptoe, and tapped her on the
head STOP "Boh! STOP he playfully shouted at her ear STOP "Never tell me again I
ca'n't say 'boh' to a goose! STOP My Lady wrung her hands STOP "Discovered! STOP she groaned STOP "Yet no--he is one
of us STOP Reveal it not, oh Man STOP Let it bide its time! STOP "Reveal what not? STOP her husband testily replied, dragging out the sheet
of brown paper STOP "What are you hiding here, my Lady STOP I insist upon
knowing! STOP My Lady cast down her eyes, and spoke in the littlest of little voices STOP "Don't make fun of it, Benjamin! STOP she pleaded STOP "It's--it's---don't you
understand STOP It's a DAGGER! STOP "And what's that for? STOP sneered His Excellency STOP "We've only got to make
people think he's dead STOP We haven't got to kill him STOP And made of tin,
too! STOP he snarled, contemptuously bending the blade round his thumb STOP "Now, Madam, you'll be good enough to explain STOP First, what do you call
me Benjamin for? STOP "It's part of the Conspiracy, Love STOP One must have an alias, you know--"

"Oh, an alias, is it STOP Well STOP And next, what did you get this dagger for STOP Come, no evasions STOP You ca'n't deceive me! STOP "I got it for--for--for--" the detected Conspirator stammered, trying
her best to put on the assassin-expression that she had been practising
at the looking-glass STOP "For--"

"For what, Madam! STOP "Well, for eighteenpence, if you must know, dearest STOP That's what I got
it for, on my--"

"Now don't say your Word and Honour! STOP groaned the other Conspirator STOP "Why, they aren't worth half the money, put together! STOP "On my birthday," my Lady concluded in a meek whisper STOP "One must have a
dagger, you know STOP It's part of the--"

"Oh, don't talk of Conspiracies! STOP her husband savagely interrupted, as
he tossed the dagger into the cupboard STOP "You know about as much how to
manage a Conspiracy as if you were a chicken STOP Why, the first thing is to
get a disguise STOP Now, just look at this! STOP And with pardonable pride he fitted on the cap and bells, and the rest
of the Fool's dress, and winked at her, and put his tongue in his cheek STOP "Is that the sort of thing, now. STOP he demanded STOP My Lady's eyes flashed with all a Conspirator's enthusiasm STOP "The very
thing! STOP she exclaimed, clapping her hands STOP "You do look, oh, such a
perfect Fool! STOP The Fool smiled a doubtful smile STOP He was not quite clear whether it was
a compliment or not, to express it so plainly STOP "You mean a Jester STOP Yes,
that's what I intended STOP And what do you think your disguise is to be? STOP And he proceeded to unfold the parcel, the lady watching him in rapture STOP "Oh, how lovely! STOP she cried, when at last the dress was unfolded STOP "What
a splendid disguise STOP An Esquimaux peasant-woman! STOP "An Esquimaux peasant, indeed! STOP growled the other STOP "Here, put it on,
and look at yourself in the glass STOP Why, it's a Bear, ca'n't you use your
eyes? STOP He checked himself suddenly, as a harsh voice yelled through the
room,


    "He looked again, and found it was
    A Bear without a Head! STOP But it was only the Gardener, singing under the open window STOP The
Vice-Warden stole on tip-toe to the window, and closed it noiselessly,
before he ventured to go on STOP "Yes, Lovey, a Bear: but not without a
head, I hope STOP You're the Bear, and me the Keeper STOP And if any one knows
us, they'll have sharp eyes, that's all! STOP "I shall have to practise the steps a bit," my Lady said, looking out
through the Bear's mouth: "one ca'n't help being rather human just at
first, you know STOP And of course you'll say 'Come up, Bruin STOP ', won't you? STOP "Yes, of course," replied the Keeper, laying hold of the chain, that
hung from the Bear's collar, with one hand, while with the other he
cracked a little whip STOP "Now go round the room in a sort of a dancing
attitude STOP Very good, my dear, very good STOP Come up, Bruin STOP Come up, I
say! STOP {Image...'Come up, bruin!' STOP He roared out the last words for the benefit of Uggug, who had just come
into the room, and was now standing, with his hands spread out, and eyes
and mouth wide open, the very picture of stupid amazement STOP "Oh, my! STOP was
all he could gasp out STOP The Keeper pretended to be adjusting the bear's collar, which gave him
an opportunity of whispering, unheard by Uggug, "my fault, I'm afraid STOP Quite forgot to fasten the door STOP Plot's ruined if he finds it out STOP Keep
it up a minute or two longer STOP Be savage! STOP Then, while seeming to pull
it back with all his strength, he let it advance upon the scared boy:
my Lady, with admirable presence of mind, kept up what she no doubt
intended for a savage growl, though it was more like the purring of a
cat: and Uggug backed out of the room with such haste that he tripped
over the mat, and was heard to fall heavily outside--an accident to
which even his doting mother paid no heed, in the excitement of the
moment STOP The Vice-Warden shut and bolted the door STOP "Off with the disguises! STOP he
panted STOP "There's not a moment to lose STOP He's sure to fetch the Professor,
and we couldn't take him in, you know! STOP And in another minute the
disguises were stowed away in the cupboard, the door unbolted, and the
two Conspirators seated lovingly side-by-side on the sofa, earnestly
discussing a book the Vice-Warden had hastily snatched off the table,
which proved to be the City-Directory of the capital of Outland STOP The door opened, very slowly and cautiously, and the Professor peeped
in, Uggug's stupid face being just visible behind him STOP "It is a beautiful arrangement! STOP the Vice-warden was saying with
enthusiasm STOP "You see, my precious one, that there are fifteen houses in
Green Street, before you turn into West Street. STOP "Fifteen houses STOP Is it possible? STOP my Lady replied STOP "I thought it was
fourteen! STOP And, so intent were they on this interesting question, that
neither of them even looked up till the Professor, leading Uggug by the
hand, stood close before them STOP My Lady was the first to notice their approach STOP "Why, here's the
Professor! STOP she exclaimed in her blandest tones STOP "And my precious child
too STOP Are lessons over? STOP "A strange thing has happened! STOP the Professor began in a trembling tone STOP "His Exalted Fatness" (this was one of Uggug's many titles) "tells me he
has just seen, in this very room, a Dancing-Bear and a Court-Jester! STOP The Vice-Warden and his wife shook with well-acted merriment STOP "Not in this room, darling! STOP said the fond mother STOP "We've been sitting
here this hour or more, reading--," here she referred to the book lying
on her lap, "--reading the--the City-Directory. STOP "Let me feel your pulse, my boy! STOP said the anxious father STOP "Now put out
your tongue STOP Ah, I thought so STOP He's a little feverish, Professor, and
has had a bad dream STOP Put him to bed at once, and give him a cooling
draught. STOP "I ain't been dreaming! STOP his Exalted Fatness remonstrated, as the
Professor led him away STOP "Bad grammar, Sir! STOP his father remarked with some sternness STOP "Kindly
attend to that little matter, Professor, as soon as you have corrected
the feverishness STOP And, by the way, Professor! STOP (The Professor left his
distinguished pupil standing at the door, and meekly returned. STOP "There
is a rumour afloat, that the people wish to elect an--in point of fact,
an--you understand that I mean an--"

"Not another Professor! STOP the poor old man exclaimed in horror STOP "No STOP Certainly not! STOP the Vice-Warden eagerly explained STOP "Merely an
Emperor, you understand. STOP "An Emperor! STOP cried the astonished Professor, holding his head between
his hands, as if he expected it to come to pieces with the shock STOP "What
will the Warden--"

"Why, the Warden will most likely be the new Emperor! STOP my Lady
explained STOP "Where could we find a better STOP Unless, perhaps--" she glanced
at her husband STOP "Where indeed! STOP the Professor fervently responded, quite failing to take
the hint STOP The Vice-Warden resumed the thread of his discourse STOP "The reason I
mentioned it, Professor, was to ask you to be so kind as to preside at
the Election STOP You see it would make the thing respectable--no suspicion
of anything, underhand--"

"I fear I ca'n't, your Excellency! STOP the old man faltered STOP "What will the
Warden--"

"True, true! STOP the Vice-Warden interrupted STOP "Your position, as
Court-Professor, makes it awkward, I admit STOP Well, well STOP Then the
Election shall be held without you. STOP "Better so, than if it were held within me! STOP the Professor murmured with
a bewildered air, as if he hardly knew what he was saying STOP "Bed, I think
your Highness said, and a cooling-draught? STOP And he wandered dreamily
back to where Uggug sulkily awaited him STOP I followed them out of the room, and down the passage, the Professor
murmuring to himself, all the time, as a kind of aid to his feeble
memory, "C, C, C; Couch, Cooling-Draught, Correct-Grammar," till, in
turning a corner, he met Sylvie and Bruno, so suddenly that the startled
Professor let go of his fat pupil, who instantly took to his heels STOP  STOP THE OTHER PROFESSOR STOP "We were looking for you! STOP cried Sylvie, in a tone of great relief STOP "We
do want you so much, you ca'n't think! STOP "What is it, dear children? STOP the Professor asked, beaming on them with a
very different look from what Uggug ever got from him STOP "We want you to speak to the Gardener for us," Sylvie said, as she and
Bruno took the old man's hands and led him into the hall STOP "He's ever so unkind! STOP Bruno mournfully added STOP "They's all unkind to us,
now that Father's gone STOP The Lion were much nicer! STOP "But you must explain to me, please," the Professor said with an anxious
look, "which is the Lion, and which is the Gardener STOP It's most important
not to get two such animals confused together STOP And one's very liable to
do it in their case--both having mouths, you know--"

"Doos oo always confuses two animals together? STOP Bruno asked STOP "Pretty often, I'm afraid," the Professor candidly confessed STOP "Now, for
instance, there's the rabbit-hutch and the hall-clock. STOP The Professor
pointed them out STOP "One gets a little confused with them--both having
doors, you know STOP Now, only yesterday--would you believe it?--I put some
lettuces into the clock, and tried to wind up the rabbit! STOP "Did the rabbit go, after oo wounded it up? STOP said Bruno STOP The Professor clasped his hands on the top of his head, and groaned STOP "Go STOP I should think it did go STOP Why, it's gone STOP And where ever it's gone
to--that's what I ca'n't find out STOP I've done my best--I've read all the
article 'Rabbit' in the great dictionary--Come in! STOP "Only the tailor, Sir, with your little bill," said a meek voice outside
the door STOP "Ah, well, I can soon settle his business," the Professor said to the
children, "if you'll just wait a minute STOP How much is it, this year, my
man? STOP The tailor had come in while he was speaking STOP "Well, it's been a doubling so many years, you see," the tailor replied,
a little gruffly, "and I think I'd like the money now STOP It's two thousand
pound, it is! STOP "Oh, that's nothing! STOP the Professor carelessly remarked, feeling in his
pocket, as if he always carried at least that amount about with him STOP "But wouldn't you like to wait just another year, and make it four
thousand STOP Just think how rich you'd be STOP Why, you might be a King, if you
liked! STOP "I don't know as I'd care about being a King," the man said
thoughtfully STOP "But it; dew sound a powerful sight o' money STOP Well, I
think I'll wait--"

"Of course you will! STOP said the Professor STOP "There's good sense in you, I
see STOP Good-day to you, my man! STOP "Will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds? STOP Sylvie asked
as the door closed on the departing creditor STOP "Never, my child! STOP the Professor replied emphatically STOP "He'll go on
doubling it, till he dies STOP You see it's always worth while waiting
another year, to get twice as much money STOP And now what would you like to
do, my little friends STOP Shall I take you to see the Other Professor STOP This would be an excellent opportunity for a visit," he said to himself,
glancing at his watch: "he generally takes a short rest--of fourteen
minutes and a half--about this time. STOP Bruno hastily went round to Sylvie, who was standing at the other side
of the Professor, and put his hand into hers STOP "I thinks we'd like to
go," he said doubtfully: "only please let's go all together STOP It's best
to be on the safe side, oo know! STOP "Why, you talk as if you were Sylvie! STOP exclaimed the Professor STOP "I know I did," Bruno replied very humbly STOP "I quite forgotted I wasn't
Sylvie STOP Only I fought he might be rarver fierce! STOP The Professor laughed a jolly laugh STOP "Oh, he's quite tame! STOP he said STOP "He never bites STOP He's only a little--a little dreamy, you know. STOP He took
hold of Bruno's other hand; and led the children down a long passage
I had never noticed before--not that there was anything remarkable
in that: I was constantly coming on new rooms and passages in that
mysterious Palace, and very seldom succeeded in finding the old ones
again STOP Near the end of the passage the Professor stopped STOP "This is his room,"
he said, pointing to the solid wall STOP "We ca'n't get in through there! STOP Bruno exclaimed STOP Sylvie said nothing, till she had carefully examined whether the wall
opened anywhere STOP Then she laughed merrily STOP "You're playing us a trick,
you dear old thing! STOP she said STOP "There's no door here! STOP "There isn't any door to the room," said the Professor STOP "We shall have
to climb in at the window. STOP So we went into the garden, and soon found the window of the Other
Professor's room STOP It was a ground-floor window, and stood invitingly
open: the Professor first lifted the two children in, and then he and I
climbed in after them STOP {Image...The other professor}

The Other Professor was seated at a table, with a large book open before
him, on which his forehead was resting: he had clasped his arms round
the book, and was snoring heavily STOP "He usually reads like that,"
the Professor remarked, "when the book's very interesting: and then
sometimes it's very difficult to get him to attend! STOP This seemed to be one of the difficult times: the Professor lifted him
up, once or twice, and shook him violently: but he always returned to
his book the moment he was let go of, and showed by his heavy breathing
that the book was as interesting as ever STOP "How dreamy he is! STOP the Professor exclaimed STOP "He must have got to a very
interesting part of the book! STOP And he rained quite a shower of thumps on
the Other Professor's back, shouting "Hoy STOP Hoy! STOP all the time STOP "Isn't it
wonderful that he should be so dreamy? STOP he said to Bruno STOP "If he's always as sleepy as that," Bruno remarked, "a course he's
dreamy! STOP "But what are we to do? STOP said the Professor STOP "You see he's quite wrapped
up in the book! STOP "Suppose oo shuts the book? STOP Bruno suggested STOP "That's it! STOP cried the delighted Professor STOP "Of course that'll do it! STOP And he shut up the book so quickly that he caught the Other Professor's
nose between the leaves, and gave it a severe pinch STOP The Other Professor instantly rose to his feet, and carried the book
away to the end of the room, where he put it back in its place in the
book-case STOP "I've been reading for eighteen hours and three-quarters,"
he said, "and now I shall rest for fourteen minutes and a half STOP Is the
Lecture all ready? STOP "Very nearly," the Professor humbly replied STOP "I shall ask you to give me
a hint or two--there will be a few little difficulties--"

"And Banquet, I think you said? STOP "Oh, yes STOP The Banquet comes first, of course STOP People never enjoy
Abstract Science, you know, when they're ravenous with hunger STOP And then
there's the Fancy-Dress-Ball STOP Oh, there'll be lots of entertainment! STOP "Where will the Ball come in? STOP said the Other Professor STOP "I think it had better come at the beginning of the Banquet--it brings
people together so nicely, you know. STOP "Yes, that's the right order STOP First the Meeting: then the Eating: then
the Treating--for I'm sure any Lecture you give us will be a treat! STOP said the Other Professor, who had been standing with his back to us all
this time, occupying himself in taking the books out, one by one, and
turning them upside-down STOP An easel, with a black board on it, stood near
him: and, every time that he turned a book upside-down, he made a mark
on the board with a piece of chalk STOP "And as to the 'Pig-Tale'--which you have so kindly promised to give
us--" the Professor went on, thoughtfully rubbing his chin STOP "I think
that had better come at the end of the Banquet: then people can listen
to it quietly. STOP "Shall I sing it? STOP the Other Professor asked, with a smile of delight STOP "If you can," the Professor replied, cautiously STOP "Let me try," said the Other Professor, seating himself at the
pianoforte STOP "For the sake of argument, let us assume that it begins on
A flat. STOP And he struck the note in question STOP "La, la, la STOP I think that's
within an octave of it. STOP He struck the note again, and appealed to
Bruno, who was standing at his side STOP "Did I sing it like that, my
child? STOP "No, oo didn't," Bruno replied with great decision STOP "It were more like a
duck. STOP "Single notes are apt to have that effect," the Other Professor said
with a sigh STOP "Let me try a whole verse,


   There was a Pig, that sat alone,
   Beside a ruined Pump STOP By day and night he made his moan:
   It would have stirred a heart of stone
   To see him wring his hoofs and groan,
   Because he could not jump STOP Would you call that a tune, Professor? STOP he asked, when he had finished STOP The Professor considered a little STOP "Well," he said at last, "some of the
notes are the same as others and some are different but I should hardly
call it a tune. STOP "Let me try it a bit by myself," said the Other Professor STOP And he began
touching the notes here and there, and humming to himself like an angry
bluebottle STOP "How do you like his singing? STOP the Professor asked the children in a low
voice STOP "It isn't very beautiful," Sylvie said, hesitatingly STOP "It's very extremely ugly! STOP Bruno said, without any hesitation at all STOP "All extremes are bad," the Professor said, very gravely STOP "For instance,
Sobriety is a very good thing, when practised in moderation: but even
Sobriety, when carried to an extreme, has its disadvantages. STOP "What are its disadvantages? STOP was the question that rose in my
mind--and, as usual, Bruno asked it for me STOP "What are its lizard
bandages? STOP "Well, this is one of them," said the Professor STOP "When a man's tipsy
(that's one extreme, you know), he sees one thing as two STOP But, when he's
extremely sober (that's the other extreme), he sees two things as one STOP It's equally inconvenient, whichever happens STOP "What does 'illconvenient' mean? STOP Bruno whispered to Sylvie STOP "The difference between 'convenient' and 'inconvenient' is best
explained by an example," said the Other Professor, who had overheard
the question STOP "If you'll just think over any Poem that contains the two
words--such as--"

The Professor put his hands over his ears, with a look of dismay STOP "If
you once let him begin a Poem," he said to Sylvie, "he'll never leave
off again STOP He never does! STOP "Did he ever begin a Poem and not leave off again? STOP Sylvie enquired STOP "Three times," said the Professor STOP Bruno raised himself on tiptoe, till his lips were on a level with
Sylvie's ear STOP "What became of them three Poems? STOP he whispered STOP "Is he
saying them all, now? STOP "Hush! STOP said Sylvie STOP "The Other Professor is speaking! STOP "I'll say it very quick," murmured the Other Professor, with downcast
eyes, and melancholy voice, which contrasted oddly with his face, as
he had forgotten to leave off smiling STOP ("At least it wasn't exactly a
smile,") as Sylvie said afterwards: "it looked as if his mouth was made
that shape. STOP "Go on then," said the Professor STOP "What must be must be. STOP "Remember that! STOP Sylvie whispered to Bruno, "It's a very good rule for
whenever you hurt yourself. STOP "And it's a very good rule for whenever I make a noise," said the saucy
little fellow STOP "So you remember it too, Miss! STOP "Whatever do you mean? STOP said Sylvie, trying to frown, a thing she never
managed particularly well STOP "Oftens and oftens," said Bruno, "haven't oo told me 'There mustn't
be so much noise, Bruno! STOP when I've tolded oo 'There must! STOP Why, there
isn't no rules at all about 'There mustn't' STOP But oo never believes me! STOP "As if any one could believe you, you wicked wicked boy! STOP said Sylvie STOP The words were severe enough, but I am of opinion that, when you are
really anxious to impress a criminal with a sense of his guilt, you
ought not to pronounce the sentence with your lips quite close to his
cheek--since a kiss at the end of it, however accidental, weakens the
effect terribly STOP  STOP PETER AND PAUL STOP "As I was saying," the other Professor resumed, "if you'll just think
over any Poem, that contains the words--such as,


   'Peter is poor,' said noble Paul,
   'And I have always been his friend:
    And, though my means to give are small,
    At least I can afford to lend STOP How few, in this cold age of greed,
    Do good, except on selfish grounds STOP But I can feel for Peter's need,
    And I WILL LEND HIM FIFTY POUNDS! STOP How great was Peter's joy to find
    His friend in such a genial vein STOP How cheerfully the bond he signed,
    To pay the money back again STOP 'We ca'n't,' said Paul, 'be too precise:
    'Tis best to fix the very day:
    So, by a learned friend's advice,
    I've made it Noon, the Fourth of May STOP {Image...'How cheefully the bond he signed!' STOP But this is April STOP Peter said STOP 'The First of April, as I think STOP Five little weeks will soon be fled:
    One scarcely will have time to wink STOP Give me a year to speculate--
    To buy and sell--to drive a trade--'
    Said Paul 'I cannot change the date STOP On May the Fourth it must be paid. STOP 'Well, well! STOP said Peter, with a sigh STOP 'Hand me the cash, and I will go STOP I'll form a Joint-Stock Company,
    And turn an honest pound or so. STOP 'I'm grieved,' said Paul, 'to seem unkind:
    The money shalt of course be lent:
    But, for a week or two, I find
    It will not be convenient. STOP So, week by week, poor Peter came
    And turned in heaviness away;
    For still the answer was the same,
    'I cannot manage it to-day. STOP And now the April showers were dry--
    The five short weeks were nearly spent--
    Yet still he got the old reply,
    'It is not quite convenient! STOP The Fourth arrived, and punctual Paul
    Came, with his legal friend, at noon STOP 'I thought it best,' said he, 'to call:
    One cannot settle things too soon. STOP Poor Peter shuddered in despair:
    His flowing locks he wildly tore:
    And very soon his yellow hair
    Was lying all about the floor STOP The legal friend was standing by,
    With sudden pity half unmanned:
    The tear-drop trembled in his eye,
    The signed agreement in his hand:
    But when at length the legal soul
    Resumed its customary force,
    'The Law,' he said, 'we ca'n't control:
    Pay, or the Law must take its course! STOP Said Paul 'How bitterly I rue
    That fatal morning when I called STOP Consider, Peter, what you do STOP You won't be richer when you're bald STOP Think you, by rending curls away,
    To make your difficulties less STOP Forbear this violence, I pray:
    You do but add to my distress! STOP {Image...'Poor peter shuddered in despair'}


    'Not willingly would I inflict,'
    Said Peter, 'on that noble heart
    One needless pang STOP Yet why so strict STOP Is this to act a friendly part STOP However legal it may be
    To pay what never has been lent,
    This style of business seems to me
    Extremely inconvenient STOP 'No Nobleness of soul have I,
    Like some that in this Age are found! STOP (Paul blushed in sheer humility,
    And cast his eyes upon the ground)
    'This debt will simply swallow all,
    And make my life a life of woe! STOP 'Nay, nay, nay Peter! STOP answered Paul STOP 'You must not rail on Fortune so STOP 'You have enough to eat and drink:
    You are respected in the world:
    And at the barber's, as I think,
    You often get your whiskers curled STOP Though Nobleness you ca'n't attain
    To any very great extent--
    The path of Honesty is plain,
    However inconvenient! STOP "Tis true, 'said Peter,' I'm alive:
    I keep my station in the world:
    Once in the week I just contrive
    To get my whiskers oiled and curled STOP But my assets are very low:
    My little income's overspent:
    To trench on capital, you know,
    Is always inconvenient! STOP 'But pay your debts! STOP cried honest Paul STOP 'My gentle Peter, pay your debts STOP What matter if it swallows all
    That you describe as your "assets" STOP Already you're an hour behind:
    Yet Generosity is best STOP It pinches me--but never mind STOP I WILL NOT CHARGE YOU INTEREST! STOP 'How good STOP How great! STOP poor Peter cried STOP 'Yet I must sell my Sunday wig--
    The scarf-pin that has been my pride--
    My grand piano--and my pig! STOP Full soon his property took wings:
    And daily, as each treasure went,
    He sighed to find the state of things
    Grow less and less convenient STOP Weeks grew to months, and months to years:
    Peter was worn to skin and bone:
    And once he even said, with tears,
    'Remember, Paul, that promised Loan! STOP Said Paul' I'll lend you, when I can,
    All the spare money I have got--
    Ah, Peter, you're a happy man STOP Yours is an enviable lot STOP {Image...Such boots as these you seldom see}


    'I'm getting stout, as you may see:
    It is but seldom I am well:
    I cannot feel my ancient glee
    In listening to the dinner-bell:
    But you, you gambol like a boy,
    Your figure is so spare and light:
    The dinner-bell's a note of joy
    To such a healthy appetite! STOP Said Peter 'I am well aware
    Mine is a state of happiness:
    And yet how gladly could I spare
    Some of the comforts I possess STOP What you call healthy appetite
    I feel as Hunger's savage tooth:
    And, when no dinner is in sight,
    The dinner-bell's a sound of ruth STOP 'No scare-crow would accept this coat:
    Such boots as these you seldom see STOP Ah, Paul, a single five-pound-note
    Would make another man of me! STOP Said Paul 'It fills me with surprise
    To hear you talk in such a tone:
    I fear you scarcely realise
    The blessings that are all your own STOP 'You're safe from being overfed:
    You're sweetly picturesque in rags:
    You never know the aching head
    That comes along with money-bags:
    And you have time to cultivate
    That best of qualities, Content--
    For which you'll find your present state
    Remarkably convenient! STOP Said Peter 'Though I cannot sound
    The depths of such a man as you,
    Yet in your character I've found
    An inconsistency or two STOP You seem to have long years to spare
    When there's a promise to fulfil:
    And yet how punctual you were
    In calling with that little bill! STOP 'One can't be too deliberate,'
    Said Paul, 'in parting with one's pelf STOP With bills, as you correctly state,
    I'm punctuality itself:
    A man may surely claim his dues:
    But, when there's money to be lent,
    A man must be allowed to choose
    Such times as are convenient! STOP It chanced one day, as Peter sat
    Gnawing a crust--his usual meal--
    Paul bustled in to have a chat,
    And grasped his hand with friendly zeal STOP 'I knew,' said he, 'your frugal ways:
    So, that I might not wound your pride
    By bringing strangers in to gaze,
    I've left my legal friend outside STOP 'You well remember, I am sure,
    When first your wealth began to go,
    And people sneered at one so poor,
    I never used my Peter so STOP And when you'd lost your little all,
    And found yourself a thing despised,
    I need not ask you to recall
    How tenderly I sympathised STOP 'Then the advice I've poured on you,
    So full of wisdom and of wit:
    All given gratis, though 'tis true
    I might have fairly charged for it STOP But I refrain from mentioning
    Full many a deed I might relate
    For boasting is a kind of thing
    That I particularly hate STOP {Image...'I will lend you fifty more!' STOP 'How vast the total sum appears

    Down to that Loan of April One STOP That Fifty Pounds STOP You little guessed
    How deep it drained my slender store:
    But there's a heart within this breast,
    And I WILL LEND YOU FIFTY MORE! STOP 'Not so,' was Peter's mild reply,
    His cheeks all wet with grateful tears;
    No man recalls, so well as I,
    Your services in bygone years:
    And this new offer, I admit,
    Is very very kindly meant--
    Still, to avail myself of it
    Would not be quite convenient! STOP You'll see in a moment what the difference is between 'convenient'
and 'inconvenient. STOP You quite understand it now, don't you? STOP he added,
looking kindly at Bruno, who was sitting, at Sylvie's side, on the
floor STOP "Yes," said Bruno, very quietly STOP Such a short speech was very unusual,
for him: but just then he seemed, I fancied, a little exhausted STOP In
fact, he climbed up into Sylvie's lap as he spoke, and rested his head
against her shoulder STOP "What a many verses it was! STOP he whispered STOP  STOP A MUSICAL GARDENER STOP The Other Professor regarded him with some anxiety STOP "The smaller animal
ought to go to bed at once," he said with an air of authority STOP "Why at once? STOP said the Professor STOP "Because he can't go at twice," said the Other Professor STOP The Professor gently clapped his hands STOP "Isn't he wonderful! STOP he said to
Sylvie STOP "Nobody else could have thought of the reason, so quick STOP Why, of
course he ca'n't go at twice STOP It would hurt him to be divided. STOP This remark woke up Bruno, suddenly and completely STOP "I don't want to be
divided," he said decisively STOP "It does very well on a diagram," said the Other Professor STOP "I could
show it you in a minute, only the chalk's a little blunt. STOP "Take care! STOP Sylvie anxiously exclaimed, as he began, rather clumsily,
to point it STOP "You'll cut your finger off, if you hold the knife so! STOP "If oo cuts it off, will oo give it to me, please STOP Bruno thoughtfully
added STOP "It's like this," said the Other Professor, hastily drawing a long line
upon the black board, and marking the letters 'A,' 'B,' at the two
ends, and 'C' in the middle: "let me explain it to you STOP If AB were to be
divided into two parts at C--"

"It would be drownded," Bruno pronounced confidently STOP The Other Professor gasped STOP "What would be drownded? STOP "Why the bumble-bee, of course! STOP said Bruno STOP "And the two bits would
sink down in the sea! STOP Here the Professor interfered, as the Other Professor was evidently too
much puzzled to go on with his diagram STOP "When I said it would hurt him, I was merely referring to the action of
the nerves--"

The Other Professor brightened up in a moment STOP "The action of the
nerves," he began eagerly, "is curiously slow in some people STOP I had a
friend, once, that, if you burnt him with a red-hot poker, it would take
years and years before he felt it! STOP "And if you only pinched him? STOP queried Sylvie STOP "Then it would take ever so much longer, of course STOP In fact, I doubt if
the man himself would ever feel it, at all STOP His grandchildren might. STOP "I wouldn't like to be the grandchild of a pinched grandfather, would
you, Mister Sir? STOP Bruno whispered STOP "It might come just when you wanted
to be happy! STOP That would be awkward, I admitted, taking it quite as a matter of course
that he had so suddenly caught sight of me STOP "But don't you always want
to be happy, Bruno? STOP "Not always," Bruno said thoughtfully STOP "Sometimes, when I's too happy,
I wants to be a little miserable STOP Then I just tell Sylvie about it, oo
know, and Sylvie sets me some lessons STOP Then it's all right. STOP "I'm sorry you don't like lessons," I said STOP "You should copy Sylvie STOP She's always as busy as the day is long! STOP "Well, so am I! STOP said Bruno STOP "No, no! STOP Sylvie corrected him STOP "You're as busy as the day is short! STOP "Well, what's the difference? STOP Bruno asked STOP "Mister Sir, isn't the day
as short as it's long STOP I mean, isn't it the same length? STOP Never having considered the question in this light, I suggested that
they had better ask the Professor; and they ran off in a moment to
appeal to their old friend STOP The Professor left off polishing his
spectacles to consider STOP "My dears," he said after a minute, "the day
is the same length as anything that is the same length as it. STOP And he
resumed his never-ending task of polishing STOP The children returned, slowly and thoughtfully, to report his answer STOP "Isn't he wise? STOP Sylvie asked in an awestruck whisper STOP "If I was as wise as that, I
should have a head-ache all day long STOP I know I should! STOP "You appear to be talking to somebody--that isn't here," the Professor
said, turning round to the children STOP "Who is it? STOP Bruno looked puzzled STOP "I never talks to nobody when he isn't here! STOP he
replied STOP "It isn't good manners STOP Oo should always wait till he comes,
before oo talks to him! STOP The Professor looked anxiously in my direction, and seemed to look
through and through me without seeing me STOP "Then who are you talking to? STOP he said STOP "There isn't anybody here, you know, except the Other Professor
and he isn't here! STOP he added wildly, turning round and round like a
teetotum STOP "Children STOP Help to look for him STOP Quick STOP He's got lost again! STOP The children were on their feet in a moment STOP "Where shall we look? STOP said Sylvie STOP "Anywhere! STOP shouted the excited Professor STOP "Only be quick about it! STOP And
he began trotting round and round the room, lifting up the chairs, and
shaking them STOP Bruno took a very small book out of the bookcase, opened it, and shook
it in imitation of the Professor STOP "He isn't here," he said STOP "He ca'n't be there, Bruno! STOP Sylvie said indignantly STOP "Course he ca'n't! STOP said Bruno STOP "I should have shooked him out, if he'd
been in there! STOP "Has he ever been lost before? STOP Sylvie enquired, turning up a corner of
the hearth-rug, and peeping under it STOP "Once before," said the Professor: "he once lost himself in a wood--"

"And couldn't he find his-self again? STOP said Bruno STOP "Why didn't he shout STOP He'd be sure to hear his-self, 'cause he couldn't be far off, oo know. STOP "Lets try shouting," said the Professor STOP "What shall we shout? STOP said Sylvie STOP "On second thoughts, don't shout," the Professor replied STOP "The
Vice-Warden might hear you STOP He's getting awfully strict! STOP This reminded the poor children of all the troubles, about which they
had come to their old friend STOP Bruno sat down on the floor and began
crying STOP "He is so cruel! STOP he sobbed STOP "And he lets Uggug take away all my
toys STOP And such horrid meals! STOP "What did you have for dinner to-day? STOP said the Professor STOP "A little piece of a dead crow," was Bruno's mournful reply STOP "He means rook-pie," Sylvie explained STOP "It were a dead crow," Bruno persisted STOP "And there were a
apple-pudding--and Uggug ate it all--and I got nuffin but a crust STOP And
I asked for a orange--and--didn't get it! STOP And the poor little fellow
buried his face in Sylvie's lap, who kept gently stroking his hair as
she went on STOP "It's all true, Professor dear STOP They do treat my darling
Bruno very badly STOP And they're not kind to me either," she added in a
lower tone, as if that were a thing of much less importance STOP The Professor got out a large red silk handkerchief, and wiped his eyes STOP "I wish I could help you, dear children! STOP he said STOP "But what can I do? STOP "We know the way to Fairyland--where Father's gone--quite well," said
Sylvie: "if only the Gardener would let us out. STOP "Won't he open the door for you? STOP said the Professor STOP "Not for us," said Sylvie: "but I'm sure he would for you STOP Do come and
ask him, Professor dear! STOP "I'll come this minute! STOP said the Professor STOP Bruno sat up and dried his eyes STOP "Isn't he kind, Mister Sir? STOP "He is indeed," said I STOP But the Professor took no notice of my remark STOP He had put on a beautiful cap with a long tassel, and was selecting one
of the Other Professor's walking-sticks, from a stand in the corner of
the room STOP "A thick stick in one's hand makes people respectful," he was
saying to himself STOP "Come along, dear children! STOP And we all went out into
the garden together STOP "I shall address him, first of all," the Professor explained as we went
along, "with a few playful remarks on the weather STOP I shall then question
him about the Other Professor STOP This will have a double advantage STOP First,
it will open the conversation (you can't even drink a bottle of
wine without opening it first): and secondly, if he's seen the Other
Professor, we shall find him that way: and, if he hasn't, we sha'n't. STOP On our way, we passed the target, at which Uggug had been made to shoot
during the Ambassador's visit STOP "See! STOP said the Professor, pointing out a hole in the middle of the
bull's-eye STOP "His Imperial Fatness had only one shot at it; and he went
in just here! STOP Bruno carefully examined the hole STOP "Couldn't go in there," he whispered
to me STOP "He are too fat! STOP We had no sort of difficulty in finding the Gardener STOP Though he was
hidden from us by some trees, that harsh voice of his served to direct
us; and, as we drew nearer, the words of his song became more and more
plainly audible:--


    "He thought he saw an Albatross
    That fluttered round the lamp:
    He looked again, and found it was
    A Penny-Postage-Stamp STOP 'You'd best be getting home,' he said:
    'The nights are very damp!' STOP {Image...He thought he saw an albatross}

"Would it be afraid of catching cold? STOP said Bruno STOP "If it got very damp," Sylvie suggested, "it might stick to something,
you know. STOP "And that somefin would have to go by the post, what ever it was! STOP Bruno
eagerly exclaimed STOP "Suppose it was a cow STOP Wouldn't it be dreadful for
the other things! STOP "And all these things happened to him," said the Professor STOP "That's what
makes the song so interesting. STOP "He must have had a very curious life," said Sylvie STOP "You may say that! STOP the Professor heartily rejoined STOP "Of course she may! STOP cried Bruno STOP By this time we had come up to the Gardener, who was standing on one
leg, as usual, and busily employed in watering a bed of flowers with an
empty watering-can STOP "It hasn't got no water in it! STOP Bruno explained to him, pulling his
sleeve to attract his attention STOP "It's lighter to hold," said the Gardener STOP "A lot of water in it makes
one's arms ache. STOP And he went on with his work, singing softly to
himself,


     "The nights are very damp! STOP "In digging things out of the ground which you probably do now and
then," the Professor began in a loud voice; "in making things into
heaps--which no doubt you often do; and in kicking things about with one
heel--which you seem never to leave off doing; have you ever happened to
notice another Professor something like me, but different? STOP "Never! STOP shouted the Gardener, so loudly and violently that we all drew
back in alarm STOP "There ain't such a thing! STOP "We will try a less exciting topic," the Professor mildly remarked to
the children STOP "You were asking--"

"We asked him to let us through the garden-door," said Sylvie: "but he
wouldn't: but perhaps he would for you! STOP The Professor put the request, very humbly and courteously STOP "I wouldn't mind letting you out," said the Gardener STOP "But I mustn't
open the door for children STOP D'you think I'd disobey the Rules STOP Not for
one-and-sixpence! STOP The Professor cautiously produced a couple of shillings STOP "That'll do it! STOP the Gardener shouted, as he hurled the watering-can
across the flower-bed, and produced a handful of keys--one large one,
and a number of small ones STOP "But look here, Professor dear! STOP whispered Sylvie STOP "He needn't open the
door for us, at all STOP We can go out with you. STOP "True, dear child! STOP the Professor thankfully replied, as he replaced
the coins in his pocket STOP "That saves two shillings! STOP And he took the
children's hands, that they might all go out together when the door
was opened STOP This, however, did not seem a very likely event, though the
Gardener patiently tried all the small keys, over and over again STOP At last the Professor ventured on a gentle suggestion STOP "Why not try the
large one STOP I have often observed that a door unlocks much more nicely
with its own key. STOP The very first trial of the large key proved a success: the Gardener
opened the door, and held out his hand for the money STOP The Professor shook his head STOP "You are acting by Rule," he explained,
"in opening the door for me STOP And now it's open, we are going out by
Rule--the Rule of Three. STOP The Gardener looked puzzled, and let us go out; but, as he locked the
door behind us, we heard him singing thoughtfully to himself,


    "He thought he saw a Garden-Door
    That opened with a key:
    He looked again, and found it was
    A Double Rule of Three:
    'And all its mystery,' he said,
    'Is clear as day to me!' STOP "I shall now return," said the Professor, when we had walked a few
yards: "you see, it's impossible to read here, for all my books are in
the house. STOP But the children still kept fast hold of his hands STOP "Do come with us! STOP Sylvie entreated with tears in her eyes STOP "Well, well! STOP said the good-natured old man STOP "Perhaps I'll come after
you, some day soon STOP But I must go back now STOP You see I left off at
a comma, and it's so awkward not knowing how the sentence finishes STOP Besides, you've got to go through Dogland first, and I'm always a little
nervous about dogs STOP But it'll be quite easy to come, as soon as I've
completed my new invention--for carrying one's-self, you know STOP It wants
just a little more working out. STOP "Won't that be very tiring, to carry yourself? STOP Sylvie enquired STOP "Well, no, my child STOP You see, whatever fatigue one incurs by carrying,
one saves by being carried STOP Good-bye, dears STOP Good-bye, Sir! STOP he added to
my intense surprise, giving my hand an affectionate squeeze STOP "Good-bye, Professor! STOP I replied: but my voice sounded strange and far
away, and the children took not the slightest notice of our farewell STOP Evidently they neither saw me nor heard me, as, with their arms lovingly
twined round each other, they marched boldly on STOP  STOP A VISIT TO DOGLAND STOP "There's a house, away there to the left," said Sylvie, after we had
walked what seemed to me about fifty miles STOP "Let's go and ask for a
night's lodging. STOP "It looks a very comfable house," Bruno said, as we turned into the
road leading up to it STOP "I doos hope the Dogs will be kind to us, I is so
tired and hungry! STOP A Mastiff, dressed in a scarlet collar, and carrying a musket, was
pacing up and down, like a sentinel, in front of the entrance STOP He
started, on catching sight of the children, and came forwards to meet
them, keeping his musket pointed straight at Bruno, who stood quite
still, though he turned pale and kept tight hold of Sylvie's hand, while
the Sentinel walked solemnly round and round them, and looked at them
from all points of view STOP {Image...The mastiff-sentinel}

"Oobooh, hooh boohooyah! STOP He growled at last STOP "Woobah yahwah oobooh STOP Bow
wahbah woobooyah STOP Bow wow? STOP he asked Bruno, severely STOP Of course Bruno understood all this, easily enough STOP All Fairies
understand Doggee---that is, Dog-language STOP But, as you may find it a
little difficult, just at first, I had better put it into English for
you STOP "Humans, I verily believe STOP A couple of stray Humans STOP What Dog do
you belong to STOP What do you want? STOP "We don't belong to a Dog! STOP Bruno began, in Doggee STOP ("Peoples never
belongs to Dogs! STOP he whispered to Sylvie. STOP But Sylvie hastily checked him, for fear of hurting the Mastiff's
feelings STOP "Please, we want a little food, and a night's lodging--if
there's room in the house," she added timidly STOP Sylvie spoke Doggee
very prettily: but I think it's almost better, for you, to give the
conversation in English STOP "The house, indeed! STOP growled the Sentinel STOP "Have you never seen a Palace
in your life STOP Come along with me STOP His Majesty must settle what's to be
done with you. STOP They followed him through the entrance-hall, down a long passage, and
into a magnificent Saloon, around which were grouped dogs of all sorts
and sizes STOP Two splendid Blood-hounds were solemnly sitting up, one on
each side of the crown-bearer STOP Two or three Bull-dogs---whom I guessed
to be the Body-Guard of the King--were waiting in grim silence: in fact
the only voices at all plainly audible were those of two little dogs,
who had mounted a settee, and were holding a lively discussion that
looked very like a quarrel STOP "Lords and Ladies in Waiting, and various Court Officials," our guide
gruffly remarked, as he led us in STOP Of me the Courtiers took no notice
whatever: but Sylvie and Bruno were the subject of many inquisitive
looks, and many whispered remarks, of which I only distinctly caught
one--made by a sly-looking Dachshund to his friend "Bah wooh wahyah
hoobah Oobooh, hah bah? STOP ("She's not such a bad-looking Human, is she?" STOP Leaving the new arrivals in the centre of the Saloon, the Sentinel
advanced to a door, at the further end of it, which bore an inscription,
painted on it in Doggee, "Royal Kennel--scratch and Yell. STOP Before doing this, the Sentinel turned to the children, and said "Give
me your names. STOP "We'd rather not! STOP Bruno exclaimed, pulling' Sylvie away from the door STOP "We want them ourselves STOP Come back, Sylvie STOP Come quick! STOP "Nonsense! STOP said Sylvie very decidedly: and gave their names in Doggee STOP Then the Sentinel scratched violently at the door, and gave a yell that
made Bruno shiver from head to foot STOP "Hooyah wah! STOP said a deep voice inside STOP (That's Doggee for "Come in!" STOP "It's the King himself! STOP the Mastiff whispered in an awestruck tone STOP "Take off your wigs, and lay them humbly at his paws. STOP (What we should
call "at his feet." STOP Sylvie was just going to explain, very politely, that really they
couldn't perform that ceremony, because their wigs wouldn't come off,
when the door of the Royal Kennel opened, and an enormous Newfoundland
Dog put his head out STOP "Bow wow? STOP was his first question STOP "When His Majesty speaks to you," the Sentinel hastily whispered to
Bruno, "you should prick up your ears! STOP Bruno looked doubtfully at Sylvie STOP "I'd rather not, please," he said STOP "It would hurt. STOP {Image...The dog-king}

"It doesn't hurt a bit! STOP the Sentinel said with some indignation STOP "Look STOP It's like this! STOP And he pricked up his ears like two railway signals STOP Sylvie gently explained matters STOP "I'm afraid we ca'n't manage it,"
she said in a low voice STOP "I'm very sorry: but our ears haven't got the
right--" she wanted to say "machinery" in Doggee: but she had forgotten
the word, and could only think of "steam-engine. STOP The Sentinel repeated Sylvie's explanation to the King STOP "Can't prick up their ears without a steam-engine! STOP His Majesty
exclaimed STOP "They must be curious creatures STOP I must have a look at them! STOP And he came out of his Kennel, and walked solemnly up to the children STOP What was the amazement--nor to say the horror of the whole assembly,
when Sylvie actually patted His Majesty on the head, while Bruno seized
his long ears and pretended to tie them together under his chin STOP The Sentinel groaned aloud: a beautiful Greyhound who appeared to be
one of the Ladies in Waiting--fainted away: and all the other Courtiers
hastily drew back, and left plenty of room for the huge Newfoundland to
spring upon the audacious strangers, and tear them limb from limb STOP Only--he didn't STOP On the contrary his Majesty actually smiled so far as
a Dog can smile--and (the other Dogs couldn't believe their eyes, but it
was true, all the same) his Majesty wagged his tail STOP "Yah STOP Hooh hahwooh! STOP (that is "Well STOP I never!" STOP was the universal cry STOP His Majesty looked round him severely, and gave a slight growl, which
produced instant silence STOP "Conduct my friends to the banqueting-hall! STOP he said, laying such an emphasis on "my friends" that several of the
dogs rolled over helplessly on their backs and began to lick Bruno's
feet STOP A procession was formed, but I only ventured to follow as far as the
door of the banqueting-hall, so furious was the uproar of barking dogs
within STOP So I sat down by the King, who seemed to have gone to sleep, and
waited till the children returned to say good-night, when His Majesty
got up and shook himself STOP "Time for bed! STOP he said with a sleepy yawn STOP "The attendants will show
you your room," he added, aside, to Sylvie and Bruno STOP "Bring lights! STOP And, with a dignified air, he held out his paw for them to kiss STOP But the children were evidently not well practised in Court-manners STOP Sylvie simply stroked the great paw: Bruno hugged it: the Master of the
Ceremonies looked shocked STOP All this time Dog-waiters, in splendid livery, were running up with
lighted candles: but, as fast as they put them upon the table, other
waiters ran away with them, so that there never seemed to be one for
me, though the Master kept nudging me with his elbow, and repeating, "I
ca'n't let you sleep here STOP You're not in bed, you know! STOP I made a great effort, and just succeeded in getting out the words "I
know I'm not STOP I'm in an arm-chair. STOP "Well, forty winks will do you no harm," the Master said, and left me STOP I could scarcely hear his words: and no wonder: he was leaning over the
side of a ship, that was miles away from the pier on which I stood STOP The
ship passed over the horizon and I sank back into the arm-chair STOP The next thing I remember is that it was morning: breakfast was just
over: Sylvie was lifting Bruno down from a high chair, and saying to
a Spaniel, who was regarding them with a most benevolent smile, "Yes,
thank you we've had a very nice breakfast STOP Haven't we, Bruno? STOP "There was too many bones in the"--Bruno began, but Sylvie frowned at
him, and laid her finger on her lips, for, at this moment, the travelers
were waited on by a very dignified officer, the Head-Growler, whose duty
it was, first to conduct them to the King to bid him farewell and
then to escort them to the boundary of Dogland STOP The great Newfoundland
received them most affably but instead of saying "good-bye" he startled
the Head-growler into giving three savage growls, by announcing that he
would escort them himself STOP It is a most unusual proceeding, your Majesty STOP the Head-Growler
exclaimed, almost choking with vexation at being set aside, for he
had put on his best Court-suit, made entirely of cat-skins, for the
occasion STOP "I shall escort them myself," his Majesty repeated, gently but firmly,
laying aside the Royal robes, and changing his crown for a small
coronet, "and you may stay at home. STOP "I are glad! STOP Bruno whispered to Sylvie, when they had got well out of
hearing STOP "He were so welly cross! STOP And he not only patted their Royal
escort, but even hugged him round the neck in the exuberance of his
delight STOP His Majesty calmly wagged the Royal tail STOP "It's quite a relief," he
said, "getting away from that Palace now and then STOP Royal Dogs have a
dull life of it, I can tell you STOP Would you mind" (this to Sylvie, in a
low voice, and looking a little shy and embarrassed) "would you mind the
trouble of just throwing that stick for me to fetch? STOP Sylvie was too much astonished to do anything for a moment: it sounded
such a monstrous impossibility that a King should wish to run after a
stick STOP But Bruno was equal to the occasion, and with a glad shout of "Hi
then STOP Fetch it, good Doggie! STOP he hurled it over a clump of bushes STOP The
next moment the Monarch of Dogland had bounded over the bushes, and
picked up the stick, and came galloping back to the children with it in
his mouth STOP Bruno took it from him with great decision STOP "Beg for it! STOP he insisted; and His Majesty begged STOP "Paw! STOP commanded Sylvie; and His
Majesty gave his paw STOP In short, the solemn ceremony of escorting the
travelers to the boundaries of Dogland became one long uproarious game
of play STOP "But business is business! STOP the Dog-King said at last STOP "And I must
go back to mine STOP I couldn't come any further," he added, consulting a
dog-watch, which hung on a chain round his neck, "not even if there were
a Cat insight! STOP They took an affectionate farewell of His Majesty, and trudged on STOP "That were a dear dog! STOP Bruno exclaimed STOP "Has we to go far, Sylvie STOP I's
tired! STOP "Not much further, darling! STOP Sylvie gently replied STOP "Do you see that
shining, just beyond those trees STOP I'm almost sure it's the gate of
Fairyland STOP I know it's all golden--Father told me so and so bright, so
bright! STOP she went on dreamily STOP "It dazzles! STOP said Bruno, shading his eyes with one little hand, while
the other clung tightly to Sylvie's hand, as if he were half-alarmed at
her strange manner STOP For the child moved on as if walking in her sleep, her large eyes gazing
into the far distance, and her breath coming and going in quick pantings
of eager delight STOP I knew, by some mysterious mental light, that a great
change was taking place in my sweet little friend (for such I loved to
think her) and that she was passing from the condition of a mere Outland
Sprite into the true Fairy-nature STOP Upon Bruno the change came later: but it was completed in both
before they reached the golden gate, through which I knew it would be
impossible for me to follow STOP I could but stand outside, and take a last
look at the two sweet children, ere they disappeared within, and the
golden gate closed with a bang STOP And with such a bang STOP "It never will shut like any other cupboard-door,"
Arthur explained STOP "There's something wrong with the hinge STOP However,
here's the cake and wine STOP And you've had your forty winks STOP So you really
must get off to bed, old man STOP You're fit for nothing else STOP Witness my
hand, Arthur Forester, M.D. STOP By this time I was wide-awake again STOP "Not quite yet! STOP I pleaded STOP "Really
I'm not sleepy now STOP And it isn't midnight yet. STOP "Well, I did want to say another word to you," Arthur replied in a
relenting tone, as he supplied me with the supper he had prescribed STOP "Only I thought you were too sleepy for it to-night. STOP We took our midnight meal almost in silence; for an unusual nervousness
seemed to have seized on my old friend STOP "What kind of a night is it? STOP he asked, rising and undrawing the
window-curtains, apparently to change the subject for a minute STOP I
followed him to the window, and we stood together, looking out, in
silence STOP "When I first spoke to you about--" Arthur began, after a long and
embarrassing silence, "that is, when we first talked about her--for I
think it was you that introduced the subject--my own position in life
forbade me to do more than worship her from a distance: and I was
turning over plans for leaving this place finally, and settling
somewhere out of all chance of meeting her again STOP That seemed to be my
only chance of usefulness in life. STOP "Would that have been wise? STOP I said STOP "To leave yourself no hope at all? STOP "There was no hope to leave," Arthur firmly replied, though his eyes
glittered with tears as he gazed upwards into the midnight sky, from
which one solitary star, the glorious 'Vega,' blazed out in fitful
splendour through the driving clouds STOP "She was like that star to
me--bright, beautiful, and pure, but out of reach, out of reach! STOP He drew the curtains again, and we returned to our places by the
fireside STOP "What I wanted to tell you was this," he resumed STOP "I heard this evening
from my solicitor STOP I can't go into the details of the business, but the
upshot is that my worldly wealth is much more than I thought, and I am
(or shall soon be) in a position to offer marriage, without imprudence,
to any lady, even if she brought nothing STOP I doubt if there would be
anything on her side: the Earl is poor, I believe STOP But I should have
enough for both, even if health failed. STOP "I wish you all happiness in your married life! STOP I cried STOP "Shall you
speak to the Earl to-morrow? STOP "Not yet awhile," said Arthur STOP "He is very friendly, but I dare not
think he means more than that, as yet STOP And as for--as for Lady Muriel,
try as I may, I cannot read her feelings towards me STOP If there is love,
she is hiding it STOP No, I must wait, I must wait! STOP I did not like to press any further advice on my friend, whose judgment,
I felt, was so much more sober and thoughtful than my own; and we parted
without more words on the subject that had now absorbed his thoughts,
nay, his very life STOP The next morning a letter from my solicitor arrived, summoning me to
town on important business STOP  STOP FAIRY-SYLVIE STOP For a full month the business, for which I had returned to London,
detained me there: and even then it was only the urgent advice of my
physician that induced me to leave it unfinished and pay another visit
to Elveston STOP Arthur had written once or twice during the month; but in none of his
letters was there any mention of Lady Muriel STOP Still, I did not augur ill
from his silence: to me it looked like the natural action of a lover,
who, even while his heart was singing "She is mine STOP ", would fear to
paint his happiness in the cold phrases of a written letter, but would
wait to tell it by word of mouth STOP "Yes," I thought, "I am to hear his
song of triumph from his own lips! STOP The night I arrived we had much to say on other matters: and, tired with
the journey, I went to bed early, leaving the happy secret still untold STOP Next day, however, as we chatted on over the remains of luncheon, I
ventured to put the momentous question STOP "Well, old friend, you have told
me nothing of Lady Muriel--nor when the happy day is to be? STOP "The happy day," Arthur said, looking unexpectedly grave, "is yet in the
dim future STOP We need to know--or, rather, she needs to know me better STOP I know her sweet nature, thoroughly, by this time STOP But I dare not speak
till I am sure that my love is returned. STOP "Don't wait too long! STOP I said gaily STOP "Faint heart never won fair lady! STOP "It is 'faint heart,' perhaps STOP But really I dare not speak just yet. STOP "But meanwhile," I pleaded, "you are running a risk that perhaps you
have not thought of STOP Some other man--"

"No," said Arthur firmly STOP "She is heart-whole: I am sure of that STOP Yet,
if she loves another better than me, so be it STOP I will not spoil her
happiness STOP The secret shall die with me STOP But she is my first--and my
only love! STOP "That is all very beautiful sentiment," I said, "but it is not
practical STOP It is not like you STOP He either fears his fate too much,
    Or his desert is small,
    Who dares not put it to the touch,
    To win or lose it all. STOP "I dare not ask the question whether there is another! STOP he said
passionately STOP "It would break my heart to know it! STOP "Yet is it wise to leave it unasked STOP You must not waste your life upon
an 'if'! STOP "I tell you I dare not!,"

"May I find it out for you? STOP I asked, with the freedom of an old friend STOP "No, no! STOP he replied with a pained look STOP "I entreat you to say nothing STOP Let it wait. STOP "As you please," I said: and judged it best to say no more just then STOP "But this evening," I thought, "I will call on the Earl STOP I may be able
to see how the land lies, without so much as saying a word! STOP It was a very hot afternoon--too hot to go for a walk or do anything--or
else it wouldn't have happened, I believe STOP In the first place, I want to know--dear Child who reads this!--why
Fairies should always be teaching us to do our duty, and lecturing us
when we go wrong, and we should never teach them anything STOP You can't
mean to say that Fairies are never greedy, or selfish, or cross, or
deceitful, because that would be nonsense, you know STOP Well then, don't
you think they might be all the better for a little lecturing and
punishing now and then STOP I really don't see why it shouldn't be tried, and I'm almost sure that,
if you could only catch a Fairy, and put it in the corner, and give it
nothing but bread and water for a day or two, you'd find it quite an
improved character--it would take down its conceit a little, at all
events STOP The next question is, what is the best time for seeing Fairies STOP I
believe I can tell you all about that STOP The first rule is, that it must be a very hot day--that we may consider
as settled: and you must be just a little sleepy--but not too sleepy to
keep your eyes open, mind STOP Well, and you ought to feel a little--what
one may call "fairyish "--the Scotch call it "eerie," and perhaps that's
a prettier word; if you don't know what it means, I'm afraid I can
hardly explain it; you must wait till you meet a Fairy, and then you'll
know STOP And the last rule is, that the crickets should not be chirping STOP I can't
stop to explain that: you must take it on trust for the present STOP So, if all these things happen together, you have a good chance of
seeing a Fairy--or at least a much better chance than if they didn't STOP The first thing I noticed, as I went lazily along through an open place
in the wood, was a large Beetle lying struggling on its back, and I went
down upon one knee to help the poor thing to its feet again STOP In some
things, you know, you ca'n't be quite sure what an insect would like:
for instance, I never could quite settle, supposing I were a moth,
whether I would rather be kept out of the candle, or be allowed to fly
straight in and get burnt--or again, supposing I were a spider, I'm not
sure if I should be quite pleased to have my web torn down, and the fly
let loose--but I feel quite certain that, if I were a beetle and had
rolled over on my back, I should always be glad to be helped up again STOP So, as I was saying, I had gone down upon one knee, and was just
reaching out a little stick to turn the Beetle over, when I saw a sight
that made me draw back hastily and hold my breath, for fear of making
any noise and frightening the little creature a way STOP Not that she looked as if she would be easily frightened: she seemed so
good and gentle that I'm sure she would never expect that any one could
wish to hurt her STOP She was only a few inches high, and was dressed in
green, so that you really would hardly have noticed her among the long
grass; and she was so delicate and graceful that she quite seemed to
belong to the place, almost as if she were one of the flowers STOP I may
tell you, besides, that she had no wings (I don't believe in Fairies
with wings), and that she had quantities of long brown hair and large
earnest brown eyes, and then I shall have done all I can to give you an
idea of her STOP {Image...Fairy-sylvie}

Sylvie (I found out her name afterwards) had knelt down, just as I was
doing, to help the Beetle; but it needed more than a little stick for
her to get it on its legs again; it was as much as she could do, with
both arms, to roll the heavy thing over; and all the while she was
talking to it, half scolding and half comforting, as a nurse might do
with a child that had fallen down STOP "There, there STOP You needn't cry so much about it STOP You're not killed
yet--though if you were, you couldn't cry, you know, and so it's a
general rule against crying, my dear STOP And how did you come to
tumble over STOP But I can see well enough how it was--I needn't ask you
that--walking over sand-pits with your chin in the air, as usual STOP Of
course if you go among sand-pits like that, you must expect to tumble STOP You should look. STOP The Beetle murmured something that sounded like "I did look," and Sylvie
went on again STOP "But I know you didn't STOP You never do STOP You always walk with your chin
up--you're so dreadfully conceited STOP Well, let's see how many legs are
broken this time STOP Why, none of them, I declare STOP And what's the good of
having six legs, my dear, if you can only kick them all about in the air
when you tumble STOP Legs are meant to walk with, you know STOP Now don't begin
putting out your wings yet; I've more to say STOP Go to the frog that
lives behind that buttercup--give him my compliments--Sylvie's
compliments--can you say compliments'? STOP The Beetle tried and, I suppose, succeeded STOP "Yes, that's right STOP And tell him he's to give you some of that salve I
left with him yesterday STOP And you'd better get him to rub it in for you STOP He's got rather cold hands, but you mustn't mind that. STOP I think the Beetle must have shuddered at this idea, for Sylvie went on
in a graver tone STOP "Now you needn't pretend to be so particular as all
that, as if you were too grand to be rubbed by a frog STOP The fact is, you
ought to be very much obliged to him STOP Suppose you could get nobody but a
toad to do it, how would you like that? STOP There was a little pause, and then Sylvie added "Now you may go STOP Be a
good beetle, and don't keep your chin in the air. STOP And then began one of
those performances of humming, and whizzing, and restless banging about,
such as a beetle indulges in when it has decided on flying, but hasn't
quite made up its mind which way to go STOP At last, in one of its awkward
zigzags, it managed to fly right into my face, and, by the time I had
recovered from the shock, the little Fairy was gone STOP I looked about in all directions for the little creature, but there
was no trace of her--and my 'eerie' feeling was quite gone off, and the
crickets were chirping again merrily--so I knew she was really gone STOP And now I've got time to tell you the rule about the crickets STOP They
always leave off chirping when a Fairy goes by--because a Fairy's a kind
of queen over them, I suppose--at all events it's a much grander
thing than a cricket--so whenever you're walking out, and the crickets
suddenly leave off chirping, you may be sure that they see a Fairy STOP I walked on sadly enough, you may be sure STOP However, I comforted myself
with thinking "It's been a very wonderful afternoon, so far STOP I'll just
go quietly on and look about me, and I shouldn't wonder if I were to
come across another Fairy somewhere. STOP Peering about in this way, I happened to notice a plant with rounded
leaves, and with queer little holes cut in the middle of several of
them STOP "Ah, the leafcutter bee! STOP I carelessly remarked--you know I am
very learned in Natural History (for instance, I can always tell kittens
from chickens at one glance)--and I was passing on, when a sudden
thought made me stoop down and examine the leaves STOP Then a little thrill of delight ran through me--for I noticed that the
holes were all arranged so as to form letters; there were three leaves
side by side, with "B," "R," and "U" marked on them, and after some
search I found two more, which contained an "N" and an "O. STOP And then, all in a moment, a flash of inner light seemed to illumine
a part of my life that had all but faded into oblivion--the strange
visions I had experienced during my journey to Elveston: and with a
thrill of delight I thought "Those visions are destined to be linked
with my waking life! STOP By this time the 'eerie' feeling had come back again, and I suddenly
observed that no crickets were chirping; so I felt quite sure that Bruno
was somewhere very near STOP And so indeed he was--so near that I had very nearly walked over him
without seeing him; which would have been dreadful, always supposing
that Fairies can be walked over my own belief is that they are something
of the nature of Will-o'-the-wisps: and there's no walking over them STOP Think of any pretty little boy you know, with rosy cheeks, large dark
eyes, and tangled brown hair, and then fancy him made small enough to go
comfortably into a coffee-cup, and you'll have a very fair idea of him STOP "What's your name, little one? STOP I began, in as soft a voice as I could
manage STOP And, by the way, why is it we always begin by asking little
children their names STOP Is it because we fancy a name will help to make
them a little bigger STOP You never thought of asking a real large man his
name, now, did you STOP But, however that may be, I felt it quite necessary
to know his name; so, as he didn't answer my question, I asked it again
a little louder STOP "What's your name, my little man? STOP "What's oors? STOP he said, without looking up STOP I told him my name quite gently, for he was much too small to be angry
with STOP "Duke of Anything? STOP he asked, just looking at me for a moment, and then
going on with his work STOP "Not Duke at all," I said, a little ashamed of having to confess it STOP "Oo're big enough to be two Dukes," said the little creature STOP "I suppose
oo're Sir Something, then? STOP "No," I said, feeling more and more ashamed STOP "I haven't got any title. STOP The Fairy seemed to think that in that case I really wasn't worth the
trouble of talking to, for he quietly went on digging, and tearing the
flowers to pieces STOP After a few minutes I tried again STOP "Please tell me what your name is. STOP "Bruno," the little fellow answered, very readily STOP "Why didn't oo say
'please' before? STOP "That's something like what we used to be taught in the nursery," I
thought to myself, looking back through the long years (about a hundred
of them, since you ask the question), to the time when I was a little
child STOP And here an idea came into my head, and I asked him "Aren't you
one of the Fairies that teach children to be good? STOP "Well, we have to do that sometimes," said Bruno, "and a dreadful bother
it is. STOP As he said this, he savagely tore a heartsease in two, and
trampled on the pieces STOP "What are you doing there, Bruno? STOP I said STOP "Spoiling Sylvie's garden," was all the answer Bruno would give at
first STOP But, as he went on tearing up the flowers, he muttered to himself
"The nasty cross thing wouldn't let me go and play this morning,--said
I must finish my lessons first--lessons, indeed STOP I'll vex her finely,
though! STOP "Oh, Bruno, you shouldn't do that! STOP I cried STOP "Don't you know that's
revenge STOP And revenge is a wicked, cruel, dangerous thing! STOP "River-edge? STOP said Bruno STOP "What a funny word STOP I suppose oo call it cruel
and dangerous 'cause, if oo wented too far and tumbleded in, oo'd get
drownded. STOP "No, not river-edge," I explained: "revenge" (saying the word very
slowly) STOP But I couldn't help thinking that Bruno's explanation did very
well for either word STOP "Oh! STOP said Bruno, opening his eyes very wide, but without trying to
repeat the word STOP "Come STOP Try and pronounce it, Bruno! STOP I said, cheerfully STOP "Re-venge,
re-venge. STOP But Bruno only tossed his little head, and said he couldn't; that his
mouth wasn't the right shape for words of that kind STOP And the more I
laughed, the more sulky the little fellow got about it STOP "Well, never mind, my little man! STOP I said STOP "Shall I help you with that
job? STOP "Yes, please," Bruno said, quite pacified STOP "Only I wiss I could think of somefin to vex her more than this STOP Oo
don't know how hard it is to make her angry! STOP "Now listen to me, Bruno, and I'll teach you quite a splendid kind of
revenge! STOP "Somefin that'll vex her finely? STOP he asked with gleaming eyes STOP "Something that will vex her finely STOP First, we'll get up all the weeds
in her garden STOP See, there are a good many at this end quite hiding the
flowers. STOP "But that won't vex her! STOP said Bruno STOP "After that," I said, without noticing the remark, "we'll water this
highest bed--up here STOP You see it's getting quite dry and dusty. STOP Bruno looked at me inquisitively, but he said nothing this time STOP "Then after that," I went on, "the walks want sweeping a bit; and I
think you might cut down that tall nettle--it's so close to the garden
that it's quite in the way--"

"What is oo talking about? STOP Bruno impatiently interrupted me STOP "All that
won't vex her a bit! STOP "Won't it? STOP I said, innocently STOP "Then, after that, suppose we put in
some of these coloured pebbles--just to mark the divisions between
the different kinds of flowers, you know STOP That'll have a very pretty
effect. STOP Bruno turned round and had another good stare at me STOP At last there
came an odd little twinkle into his eyes, and he said, with quite a new
meaning in his voice, "That'll do nicely STOP Let's put 'em in rows--all the
red together, and all the blue together. STOP "That'll do capitally," I said; "and then--what kind of flowers does
Sylvie like best? STOP Bruno had to put his thumb in his mouth and consider a little before he
could answer STOP "Violets," he said, at last STOP "There's a beautiful bed of violets down by the brook--"

"Oh, let's fetch 'em! STOP cried Bruno, giving a little skip into the air STOP "Here STOP Catch hold of my hand, and I'll help oo along STOP The grass is
rather thick down that way. STOP I couldn't help laughing at his having so entirely forgotten what a
big creature he was talking to STOP "No, not yet, Bruno," I said: "we must
consider what's the right thing to do first STOP You see we've got quite a
business before us. STOP "Yes, let's consider," said Bruno, putting his thumb into his mouth
again, and sitting down upon a dead mouse STOP "What do you keep that mouse for? STOP I said STOP "You should either bury it,
or else throw it into the brook. STOP "Why, it's to measure with! STOP cried Bruno STOP "How ever would oo do a garden
without one STOP We make each bed three mouses and a half long, and two
mouses wide. STOP I stopped him, as he was dragging it off by the tail to show me how it
was used, for I was half afraid the 'eerie' feeling might go off before
we had finished the garden, and in that case I should see no more of him
or Sylvie STOP "I think the best way will be for you to weed the beds, while
I sort out these pebbles, ready to mark the walks with. STOP "That's it! STOP cried Bruno STOP "And I'll tell oo about the caterpillars while
we work. STOP "Ah, let's hear about the caterpillars," I said, as I drew the pebbles
together into a heap and began dividing them into colours STOP And Bruno went on in a low, rapid tone, more as if he were talking to
himself STOP "Yesterday I saw two little caterpillars, when I was sitting
by the brook, just where oo go into the wood STOP They were quite green, and
they had yellow eyes, and they didn't see me STOP And one of them had got a
moth's wing to carry--a great brown moth's wing, oo know, all dry, with
feathers STOP So he couldn't want it to eat, I should think--perhaps he
meant to make a cloak for the winter? STOP "Perhaps," I said, for Bruno had twisted up the last word into a sort of
question, and was looking at me for an answer STOP One word was quite enough for the little fellow, and he went on merrily STOP "Well, and so he didn't want the other caterpillar to see the moth's
wing, oo know--so what must he do but try to carry it with all his left
legs, and he tried to walk on the other set STOP Of course he toppled over
after that. STOP "After what? STOP I said, catching at the last word, for, to tell the truth,
I hadn't been attending much STOP "He toppled over," Bruno repeated, very gravely, "and if oo ever saw a
caterpillar topple over, oo'd know it's a welly serious thing, and not
sit grinning like that--and I sha'n't tell oo no more! STOP "Indeed and indeed, Bruno, I didn't mean to grin STOP See, I'm quite grave
again now. STOP But Bruno only folded his arms, and said "Don't tell me STOP I see a little
twinkle in one of oor eyes--just like the moon. STOP "Why do you think I'm like the moon, Bruno? STOP I asked STOP "Oor face is large and round like the moon," Bruno answered, looking
at me thoughtfully STOP "It doosn't shine quite so bright--but it's more
cleaner. STOP I couldn't help smiling at this STOP "You know I sometimes wash my face,
Bruno STOP The moon never does that. STOP "Oh, doosn't she though! STOP cried Bruno; and he leant forwards and added
in a solemn whisper, "The moon's face gets dirtier and dirtier every
night, till it's black all across STOP And then, when it's dirty all
over--so--" (he passed his hand across his own rosy cheeks as he spoke)
"then she washes it. STOP "Then it's all clean again, isn't it? STOP "Not all in a moment," said Bruno STOP "What a deal of teaching oo wants STOP She washes it little by little--only she begins at the other edge, oo
know. STOP By this time he was sitting quietly on the dead mouse with his arms
folded, and the weeding wasn't getting on a bit: so I had to say "Work
first, pleasure afterwards: no more talking till that bed's finished. STOP  STOP BRUNO'S REVENGE STOP After that we had a few minutes of silence, while I sorted out the
pebbles, and amused myself with watching Bruno's plan of gardening STOP It
was quite a new plan to me: he always measured each bed before he weeded
it, as if he was afraid the weeding would make it shrink; and once, when
it came out longer than he wished, he set to work to thump the mouse
with his little fist, crying out "There now STOP It's all gone wrong again STOP Why don't oo keep oor tail straight when I tell oo! STOP "I'll tell you what I'll do," Bruno said in a half-whisper, as we
worked STOP "Oo like Fairies, don't oo? STOP "Yes," I said: "of course I do, or I shouldn't have come here STOP I should
have gone to some place where there are no Fairies. STOP Bruno laughed contemptuously STOP "Why, oo might as well say oo'd go to some
place where there wasn't any air--supposing oo didn't like air! STOP This was a rather difficult idea to grasp STOP I tried a change of subject STOP "You're nearly the first Fairy I ever saw STOP Have you ever seen any people
besides me? STOP "Plenty! STOP said Bruno STOP "We see'em when we walk in the road. STOP "But they ca'n't see you STOP How is it they never tread on you? STOP "Ca'n't tread on us," said Bruno, looking amused at my ignorance STOP "Why,
suppose oo're walking, here--so--" (making little marks on the ground)
"and suppose there's a Fairy--that's me--walking here STOP Very well then,
oo put one foot here, and one foot here, so oo doosn't tread on the
Fairy. STOP This was all very well as an explanation, but it didn't convince me STOP "Why shouldn't I put one foot on the Fairy? STOP I asked STOP "I don't know why," the little fellow said in a thoughtful tone STOP "But
I know oo wouldn't STOP Nobody never walked on the top of a Fairy STOP Now
I'll tell oo what I'll do, as oo're so fond of Fairies STOP I'll get oo
an invitation to the Fairy-King's dinner-party STOP I know one of the
head-waiters. STOP I couldn't help laughing at this idea STOP "Do the waiters invite the
guests? STOP I asked STOP "Oh, not to sit down! STOP Bruno said STOP "But to wait at table STOP Oo'd like
that, wouldn't oo STOP To hand about plates, and so on. STOP "Well, but that's not so nice as sitting at the table, is it? STOP "Of course it isn't," Bruno said, in a tone as if he rather pitied my
ignorance; "but if oo're not even Sir Anything, oo ca'n't expect to be
allowed to sit at the table, oo know. STOP I said, as meekly as I could, that I didn't expect it, but it was the
only way of going to a dinner-party that I really enjoyed STOP And Bruno
tossed his head, and said, in a rather offended tone that I might do as
I pleased--there were many he knew that would give their ears to go STOP "Have you ever been yourself, Bruno? STOP "They invited me once, last week," Bruno said, very gravely STOP "It was
to wash up the soup-plates--no, the cheese-plates I mean that was
grand enough STOP And I waited at table STOP And I didn't hardly make only one
mistake. STOP "What was it? STOP I said STOP "You needn't mind telling me. STOP "Only bringing scissors to cut the beef with," Bruno said carelessly STOP "But the grandest thing of all was, I fetched the King a glass of
cider! STOP "That was grand! STOP I said, biting my lip to keep myself from laughing STOP "Wasn't it? STOP said Bruno, very earnestly STOP "Oo know it isn't every one
that's had such an honour as that! STOP This set me thinking of the various queer things we call "an honour" in
this world, but which, after all, haven't a bit more honour in them than
what Bruno enjoyed, when he took the King a glass of cider STOP I don't know how long I might not have dreamed on in this way, if Bruno
hadn't suddenly roused me STOP "Oh, come here quick! STOP he cried, in a state
of the wildest excitement STOP "Catch hold of his other horn STOP I ca'n't hold
him more than a minute! STOP He was struggling desperately with a great snail, clinging to one of its
horns, and nearly breaking his poor little back in his efforts to drag
it over a blade of grass STOP I saw we should have no more gardening if I let this sort of thing go
on, so I quietly took the snail away, and put it on a bank where he
couldn't reach it STOP "We'll hunt it afterwards, Bruno," I said, "if you
really want to catch it STOP But what's the use of it when you've got it? STOP "What's the use of a fox when oo've got it? STOP said Bruno STOP "I know oo big
things hunt foxes. STOP I tried to think of some good reason why "big things" should hunt foxes,
and he should not hunt snails, but none came into my head: so I said at
last, "Well, I suppose one's as good as the other STOP I'll go snail-hunting
myself some day. STOP "I should think oo wouldn't be so silly," said Bruno, "as to go
snail-hunting by oor-self STOP Why, oo'd never get the snail along, if oo
hadn't somebody to hold on to his other horn! STOP "Of course I sha'n't go alone," I said, quite gravely STOP "By the way,
is that the best kind to hunt, or do you recommend the ones without
shells? STOP "Oh, no, we never hunt the ones without shells," Bruno said, with a
little shudder at the thought of it STOP "They're always so cross about it;
and then, if oo tumbles over them, they're ever so sticky! STOP By this time we had nearly finished the garden STOP I had fetched some
violets, and Bruno was just helping me to put in the last, when he
suddenly stopped and said "I'm tired. STOP "Rest then," I said: "I can go on without you, quite well. STOP Bruno needed no second invitation: he at once began arranging the dead
mouse as a kind of sofa STOP "And I'll sing oo a little song," he said, as
he rolled it about STOP "Do," said I: "I like songs very much. STOP "Which song will oo choose? STOP Bruno said, as he dragged the mouse into a
place where he could get a good view of me STOP "'Ting, ting, ting' is the
nicest. STOP There was no resisting such a strong hint as this: however, I pretended
to think about it for a moment, and then said "Well, I like 'Ting, ting,
ting,' best of all. STOP {Image...Bruno's revenge}

"That shows oo're a good judge of music," Bruno said, with a pleased
look STOP "How many hare-bells would oo like? STOP And he put his thumb into his
mouth to help me to consider STOP As there was only one cluster of hare-bells within easy reach, I said
very gravely that I thought one would do this time, and I picked it
and gave it to him STOP Bruno ran his hand once or twice up and down
the flowers, like a musician trying an instrument, producing a most
delicious delicate tinkling as he did so STOP I had never heard flower-music
before--I don't think one can, unless one's in the 'eerie' state and I
don't know quite how to give you an idea of what it was like, except by
saying that it sounded like a peal of bells a thousand miles off STOP When he had satisfied himself that the flowers were in tune, he seated
himself on the dead mouse (he never seemed really comfortable anywhere
else), and, looking up at me with a merry twinkle in his eyes, he began STOP By the way, the tune was rather a curious one, and you might like to try
it for yourself, so here are the notes STOP {Image...Music for hare-bells}


    "Rise, oh, rise STOP The daylight dies:
     The owls are hooting, ting, ting, ting STOP Wake, oh, wake STOP Beside the lake
     The elves are fluting, ting, ting, ting STOP Welcoming our Fairy King,
     We sing, sing, sing. STOP He sang the first four lines briskly and merrily, making the hare-bells
chime in time with the music; but the last two he sang quite slowly and
gently, and merely waved the flowers backwards and forwards STOP Then he
left off to explain STOP "The Fairy-King is Oberon, and he lives across the
lake--and sometimes he comes in a little boat--and we go and meet him
and then we sing this song, you know. STOP "And then you go and dine with him? STOP I said, mischievously STOP "Oo shouldn't talk," Bruno hastily said: "it interrupts the song so. STOP I said I wouldn't do it again STOP "I never talk myself when I'm singing," he went on very gravely: "so oo
shouldn't either. STOP Then he tuned the hare-bells once more, and sang:---


    "Hear, oh, hear STOP From far and near
    The music stealing, ting, ting, ting STOP Fairy belts adown the dells
    Are merrily pealing, ting, ting, ting STOP Welcoming our Fairy King,
    We ring, ring, ring STOP "See, oh, see STOP On every tree
    What lamps are shining, ting, ting, ting STOP They are eyes of fiery flies
    To light our dining, ting, ting, ting STOP Welcoming our Fairy King
    They swing, swing, swing STOP "Haste, oh haste, to take and taste
    The dainties waiting, ting, ting, ting STOP Honey-dew is stored--"

"Hush, Bruno! STOP I interrupted in a warning whisper STOP "She's coming! STOP Bruno checked his song, and, as she slowly made her way through the
long grass, he suddenly rushed out headlong at her like a little bull,
shouting "Look the other way STOP Look the other way! STOP "Which way? STOP Sylvie asked, in rather a frightened tone, as she looked
round in all directions to see where the danger could be STOP "That way! STOP said Bruno, carefully turning her round with her face to the
wood STOP "Now, walk backwards walk gently--don't be frightened: oo sha'n't
trip! STOP But Sylvie did trip notwithstanding: in fact he led her, in his hurry,
across so many little sticks and stones, that it was really a wonder
the poor child could keep on her feet at all STOP But he was far too much
excited to think of what he was doing STOP I silently pointed out to Bruno the best place to lead her to, so as to
get a view of the whole garden at once: it was a little rising ground,
about the height of a potato; and, when they had mounted it, I drew back
into the shade, that Sylvie mightn't see me STOP I heard Bruno cry out triumphantly "Now oo may look! STOP and then followed
a clapping of hands, but it was all done by Bruno himself STOP Sylvie: was
silent--she only stood and gazed with her hands clasped together, and I
was half afraid she didn't like it after all STOP Bruno too was watching her anxiously, and when she jumped down off the
mound, and began wandering up and down the little walks, he cautiously
followed her about, evidently anxious that she should form her own
opinion of it all, without any hint from him STOP And when at last she drew
a long breath, and gave her verdict--in a hurried whisper, and without
the slightest regard to grammar--"It's the loveliest thing as I never
saw in all my life before! STOP the little fellow looked as well pleased
as if it had been given by all the judges and juries in England put
together STOP "And did you really do it all by yourself, Bruno? STOP said Sylvie STOP "And all
for me? STOP "I was helped a bit," Bruno began, with a merry little laugh at her
surprise STOP "We've been at it all the afternoon--I thought oo'd like--"
and here the poor little fellow's lip began to quiver, and all in a
moment he burst out crying, and running up to Sylvie he flung his arms
passionately round her neck, and hid his face on her shoulder STOP There was a little quiver in Sylvie's voice too, as she whispered "Why,
what's the matter, darling? STOP and tried to lift up his head and kiss him STOP But Bruno only clung to her, sobbing, and wouldn't be comforted till
he had confessed STOP "I tried--to spoil oor garden--first--but I'll
never--never--" and then came another burst of tears, which drowned the
rest of the sentence STOP At last he got out the words "I liked--putting in
the flowers--for oo, Sylvie--and I never was so happy before. STOP And the
rosy little face came up at last to be kissed, all wet with tears as it
was STOP Sylvie was crying too by this time, and she said nothing but "Bruno,
dear! STOP and "I never was so happy before," though why these two children
who had never been so happy before should both be crying was a mystery
to me STOP I felt very happy too, but of course I didn't cry: "big things" never
do, you know we leave all that to the Fairies STOP Only I think it must have
been raining a little just then, for I found a drop or two on my cheeks STOP After that they went through the whole garden again, flower by flower,
as if it were a long sentence they were spelling out, with kisses for
commas, and a great hug by way of a full-stop when they got to the end STOP "Doos oo know, that was my river-edge, Sylvie? STOP Bruno solemnly began STOP Sylvie laughed merrily STOP "What do you mean? STOP she said STOP And she pushed
back her heavy brown hair with both hands, and looked at him with
dancing eyes in which the big teardrops were still glittering STOP Bruno drew in a long breath, and made up his mouth for a great effort STOP "I mean revenge," he said: "now oo under'tand. STOP And he looked so happy
and proud at having said the word right at last, that I quite envied
him STOP I rather think Sylvie didn't "under'tand" at all; but she gave him
a little kiss on each cheek, which seemed to do just as well STOP So they wandered off lovingly together, in among the buttercups, each
with an arm twined round the other, whispering and laughing as they
went, and never so much as once looked back at poor me STOP Yes, once,
just before I quite lost sight of them, Bruno half turned his head, and
nodded me a saucy little good-bye over one shoulder STOP And that was all
the thanks I got for my trouble STOP The very last thing I saw of them was
this--Sylvie was stooping down with her arms round Bruno's neck, and
saying coaxingly in his ear, "Do you know, Bruno, I've quite forgotten
that hard word STOP Do say it once more STOP Come STOP Only this once, dear! STOP But Bruno wouldn't try it again STOP  STOP A CHANGED CROCODILE STOP The Marvellous--the Mysterious--had quite passed out of my life for the
moment: and the Common-place reigned supreme STOP I turned in the direction
of the Earl's house, as it was now 'the witching hour' of five, and I
knew I should find them ready for a cup of tea and a quiet chat STOP Lady Muriel and her father gave me a delightfully warm welcome STOP They
were not of the folk we meet in fashionable drawing-rooms who conceal
all such feelings as they may chance to possess beneath the impenetrable
mask of a conventional placidity STOP 'The Man with the Iron Mask' was, no
doubt, a rarity and a marvel in his own age: in modern London no one
would turn his head to give him a second look STOP No, these were real
people STOP When they looked pleased, it meant that they were pleased: and
when Lady Muriel said, with a bright smile, "I'm very glad to see you
again STOP ", I knew that it was true STOP Still I did not venture to disobey the injunctions--crazy as I felt
them to be--of the lovesick young Doctor, by so much as alluding to his
existence: and it was only after they had given me full details of a
projected picnic, to which they invited me, that Lady Muriel exclaimed,
almost as an after-thought, "and do, if you can, bring Doctor Forester
with you STOP I'm sure a day in the country would do him good STOP I'm afraid he
studies too much--"

It was 'on the tip of my tongue' to quote the words "His only books are
woman's looks! STOP but I checked myself just in time--with something of the
feeling of one who has crossed a street, and has been all but run over
by a passing 'Hansom. STOP "--and I think he has too lonely a life," she went on, with a gentle
earnestness that left no room whatever to suspect a double meaning STOP "Do
get him to come STOP And don't forget the day, Tuesday week STOP We can drive
you over STOP It would be a pity to go by rail----there is so much pretty
scenery on the road STOP And our open carriage just holds four. STOP "Oh, I'll persuade him to come! STOP I said with confidence--thinking "it
would take all my powers of persuasion to keep him away! STOP The picnic was to take place in ten days: and though Arthur readily
accepted the invitation I brought him, nothing that I could say would
induce him to call--either with me or without me on the Earl and his
daughter in the meanwhile STOP No: he feared to "wear out his welcome," he
said: they had "seen enough of him for one while": and, when at last the
day for the expedition arrived, he was so childishly nervous and
uneasy that I thought it best so to arrange our plans that we should go
separately to the house--my intention being to arrive some time after
him, so as to give him time to get over a meeting STOP With this object I purposely made a considerable circuit on my way to
the Hall (as we called the Earl's house): "and if I could only manage to
lose my way a bit," I thought to myself, "that would suit me capitally! STOP In this I succeeded better, and sooner, than I had ventured to hope
for STOP The path through the wood had been made familiar to me, by many a
solitary stroll, in my former visit to Elveston; and how I could have
so suddenly and so entirely lost it--even though I was so engrossed in
thinking of Arthur and his lady-love that I heeded little else--was a
mystery to me STOP "And this open place," I said to myself, "seems to have
some memory about it I cannot distinctly recall--surely it is the very
spot where I saw those Fairy-Children STOP But I hope there are no snakes
about! STOP I mused aloud, taking my seat on a fallen tree STOP "I certainly do
not like snakes--and I don't suppose Bruno likes them, either! STOP "No, he doesn't like them! STOP said a demure little voice at my side STOP "He's
not afraid of them, you know STOP But he doesn't like them STOP He says they're
too waggly! STOP Words fail me to describe the beauty of the little group--couched on a
patch of moss, on the trunk of the fallen tree, that met my eager gaze:
Sylvie reclining with her elbow buried in the moss, and her rosy cheek
resting in the palm of her hand, and Bruno stretched at her feet with
his head in her lap STOP {Image...Fairies resting}

"Too waggly? STOP was all I could say in so sudden an emergency STOP "I'm not praticular," Bruno said, carelessly: "but I do like straight
animals best--"

"But you like a dog when it wags its tail," Sylvie interrupted STOP "You
know you do, Bruno! STOP "But there's more of a dog, isn't there, Mister Sir? STOP Bruno appealed to
me STOP "You wouldn't like to have a dog if it hadn't got nuffin but a head
and a tail? STOP I admitted that a dog of that kind would be uninteresting STOP "There isn't such a dog as that," Sylvie thoughtfully remarked STOP "But there would be," cried Bruno, "if the Professor shortened it up for
us! STOP "Shortened it up? STOP I said STOP "That's something new STOP How does he do it? STOP "He's got a curious machine," Sylvie was beginning to explain STOP "A welly curious machine," Bruno broke in, not at all willing to
have the story thus taken out of his mouth, "and if oo puts
in--some-finoruvver--at one end, oo know and he turns the handle--and it
comes out at the uvver end, oh, ever so short! STOP "As short as short! STOP Sylvie echoed STOP "And one day when we was in Outland, oo know--before we came to
Fairyland me and Sylvie took him a big Crocodile STOP And he shortened it up
for us STOP And it did look so funny STOP And it kept looking round, and saying
'wherever is the rest of me got to? STOP And then its eyes looked unhappy--"

"Not both its eyes," Sylvie interrupted STOP "Course not! STOP said the little fellow STOP "Only the eye that couldn't
see wherever the rest of it had got to STOP But the eye that could see
wherever--"

"How short was the crocodile? STOP I asked, as the story was getting a
little complicated STOP "Half as short again as when we caught it--so long," said Bruno,
spreading out his arms to their full stretch STOP I tried to calculate what this would come to, but it was too hard for
me STOP Please make it out for me, dear Child who reads this STOP "But you didn't leave the poor thing so short as that, did you? STOP "Well, no STOP Sylvie and me took it back again and we got it stretched
to--to--how much was it, Sylvie? STOP "Two times and a half, and a little bit more," said Sylvie STOP "It wouldn't like that better than the other way, I'm afraid? STOP "Oh, but it did though! STOP Bruno put in eagerly STOP "It were proud of its new
tail STOP Oo never saw a Crocodile so proud STOP Why, it could go round and walk
on the top of its tail, and along its back, all the way to its head! STOP {Image...A changed crocodile}

"Not quite all the way," said Sylvie STOP "It couldn't, you know. STOP "Ah, but it did, once! STOP Bruno cried triumphantly STOP "Oo weren't
looking--but I watched it STOP And it walked on tippiety-toe, so as it
wouldn't wake itself, 'cause it thought it were asleep STOP And it got both
its paws on its tail STOP And it walked and it walked all the way along its
back STOP And it walked and it walked on its forehead STOP And it walked a tiny
little way down its nose STOP There now! STOP This was a good deal worse than the last puzzle STOP Please, dear Child,
help again STOP "I don't believe no Crocodile never walked along its own forehead! STOP Sylvie cried, too much excited by the controversy to limit the number of
her negatives STOP "Oo don't know the reason why it did it! STOP Bruno scornfully retorted STOP "It
had a welly good reason STOP I heerd it say 'Why shouldn't I walk on my own
forehead? STOP So a course it did, oo know! STOP "If that's a good reason, Bruno," I said, "why shouldn't you get up that
tree? STOP "Shall, in a minute," said Bruno: "soon as we've done talking STOP Only two
peoples ca'n't talk comfably togevver, when one's getting up a tree, and
the other isn't! STOP It appeared to me that a conversation would scarcely be 'comfable' while
trees were being climbed, even if both the 'peoples' were doing it: but
it was evidently dangerous to oppose any theory of Bruno's; so I thought
it best to let the question drop, and to ask for an account of the
machine that made things longer STOP This time Bruno was at a loss, and left it to Sylvie STOP "It's like a
mangle," she said: "if things are put in, they get squoze--"

"Squeezeled! STOP Bruno interrupted STOP "Yes. STOP Sylvie accepted the correction, but did not attempt to pronounce
the word, which was evidently new to her STOP "They get--like that--and they
come out, oh, ever so long! STOP "Once," Bruno began again, "Sylvie and me writed--"

"Wrote! STOP Sylvie whispered STOP "Well, we wroted a Nursery-Song, and the Professor mangled it longer for
us STOP It were 'There was a little Man, And he had a little gun, And the
bullets--'"

"I know the rest," I interrupted STOP "But would you say it long I mean the
way that it came out of the mangle? STOP "We'll get the Professor to sing it for you," said Sylvie STOP "It would
spoil it to say it. STOP "I would like to meet the Professor," I said STOP "And I would like to take
you all with me, to see some friends of mine, that live near here STOP Would
you like to come? STOP "I don't think the Professor would like to come," said Sylvie STOP "He's
very shy STOP But we'd like it very much STOP Only we'd better not come this
size, you know. STOP The difficulty had occurred to me already: and I had felt that perhaps
there would be a slight awkwardness in introducing two such tiny friends
into Society STOP "What size will you be? STOP I enquired STOP "We'd better come as--common children," Sylvie thoughtfully replied STOP "That's the easiest size to manage. STOP "Could you come to-day? STOP I said, thinking "then we could have you at the
picnic! STOP Sylvie considered a little STOP "Not to-day," she replied STOP "We haven't got
the things ready STOP We'll come on--Tuesday next, if you like STOP And now,
really Bruno, you must come and do your lessons. STOP "I wiss oo wouldn't say 'really Bruno!' STOP the little fellow pleaded, with
pouting lips that made him look prettier than ever STOP "It always show's
there's something horrid coming STOP And I won't kiss you, if you're so
unkind. STOP "Ah, but you have kissed me! STOP Sylvie exclaimed in merry triumph STOP "Well then, I'll unkiss you! STOP And he threw his arms round her neck for
this novel, but apparently not very painful, operation STOP "It's very like kissing! STOP Sylvie remarked, as soon as her lips were
again free for speech STOP "Oo don't know nuffin about it STOP It were just the conkery! STOP Bruno replied
with much severity, as he marched away STOP Sylvie turned her laughing face to me STOP "Shall we come on Tuesday? STOP she
said STOP "Very well," I said: "let it be Tuesday next STOP But where is the
Professor STOP Did he come with you to Fairyland? STOP "No," said Sylvie STOP "But he promised he'd come and see us, some day STOP He's
getting his Lecture ready STOP So he has to stay at home. STOP "At home? STOP I said dreamily, not feeling quite sure what she had said STOP "Yes, Sir STOP His Lordship and Lady Muriel are at home STOP Please to walk this
way. STOP  STOP THE THREE BADGERS STOP Still more dreamily I found myself following this imperious voice into
a room where the Earl, his daughter, and Arthur, were seated STOP "So you're
come at last! STOP said Lady Muriel, in a tone of playful reproach STOP "I was delayed," I stammered STOP Though what it was that had delayed me I
should have been puzzled to explain STOP Luckily no questions were asked STOP The carriage was ordered round, the hamper, containing our contribution
to the Picnic, was duly stowed away, and we set forth STOP There was no need for me to maintain the conversation STOP Lady Muriel and
Arthur were evidently on those most delightful of terms, where one has
no need to check thought after thought, as it rises to the lips, with
the fear 'this will not be appreciated--this will give' offence--this
will sound too serious--this will sound flippant': like very old
friends, in fullest sympathy, their talk rippled on STOP "Why shouldn't we desert the Picnic and go in some other direction? STOP she
suddenly suggested STOP "A party of four is surely self-sufficing STOP And as
for food, our hamper--"

"Why shouldn't we STOP What a genuine lady's argument! STOP laughed Arthur STOP "A lady never knows on which side the onus probandi--the burden of
proving--lies! STOP "Do men always know? STOP she asked with a pretty assumption of meek
docility STOP "With one exception--the only one I can think of Dr. Watts, who has
asked the senseless question,


    'Why should I deprive my neighbour
    Of his goods against his will? STOP Fancy that as an argument for Honesty STOP His position seems to be 'I'm
only honest because I see no reason to steal. STOP And the thief's answer
is of course complete and crushing STOP 'I deprive my neighbour of his goods
because I want them myself STOP And I do it against his will because there's
no chance of getting him to consent to it!' STOP "I can give you one other exception," I said: "an argument I heard only
to-day---and not by a lady STOP 'Why shouldn't I walk on my own forehead?' STOP "What a curious subject for speculation! STOP said Lady Muriel, turning to
me, with eyes brimming over with laughter STOP "May we know who propounded
the question STOP And did he walk on his own forehead? STOP "I ca'n't remember who it was that said it! STOP I faltered STOP "Nor where I
heard it! STOP "Whoever it was, I hope we shall meet him at the Picnic! STOP said Lady
Muriel STOP "It's a far more interesting question than 'Isn't this a
picturesque ruin? STOP Aren't those autumn-tints lovely? STOP I shall have to
answer those two questions ten times, at least, this afternoon! STOP "That's one of the miseries of Society! STOP said Arthur STOP "Why ca'n't people
let one enjoy the beauties of Nature without having to say so every
minute STOP Why should Life be one long Catechism? STOP "It's just as bad at a picture-gallery," the Earl remarked STOP "I went to
the R.A. last May, with a conceited young artist: and he did torment me STOP I wouldn't have minded his criticizing the pictures himself: but I had
to agree with him--or else to argue the point, which would have been
worse! STOP "It was depreciatory criticism, of course? STOP said Arthur STOP "I don't see the 'of course' at all. STOP "Why, did you ever know a conceited man dare to praise a picture STOP The one thing he dreads (next to not being noticed) is to be proved
fallible STOP If you once praise a picture, your character for infallibility
hangs by a thread STOP Suppose it's a figure-picture, and you venture to say
'draws well. STOP Somebody measures it, and finds one of the proportions an
eighth of an inch wrong STOP You are disposed of as a critic STOP 'Did you say
he draws well? STOP your friends enquire sarcastically, while you hang your
head and blush STOP No STOP The only safe course, if any one says 'draws well,'
is to shrug your shoulders STOP 'Draws well? STOP you repeat thoughtfully STOP 'Draws well STOP Humph! STOP That's the way to become a great critic! STOP Thus airily chatting, after a pleasant drive through a few miles of
beautiful scenery, we reached the rendezvous--a ruined castle--where the
rest of the picnic-party were already assembled STOP We spent an hour or
two in sauntering about the ruins: gathering at last, by common consent,
into a few random groups, seated on the side of a mound, which commanded
a good view of the old castle and its surroundings STOP The momentary silence, that ensued, was promptly taken possession of or,
more correctly, taken into custody--by a Voice; a voice so smooth, so
monotonous, so sonorous, that one felt, with a shudder, that any other
conversation was precluded, and that, unless some desperate remedy were
adopted, we were fated to listen to a Lecture, of which no man could
foresee the end STOP The speaker was a broadly-built man, whose large, flat, pale face was
bounded on the North by a fringe of hair, on the East and West by a
fringe of whisker, and on the South by a fringe of beard--the whole
constituting a uniform halo of stubbly whitey-brown bristles STOP His
features were so entirely destitute of expression that I could not
help saying to myself--helplessly, as if in the clutches of a
night-mare--"they are only penciled in: no final touches as yet! STOP And
he had a way of ending every sentence with a sudden smile, which spread
like a ripple over that vast blank surface, and was gone in a moment,
leaving behind it such absolute solemnity that I felt impelled to murmur
"it was not he: it was somebody else that smiled! STOP "Do you observe? STOP (such was the phrase with which the wretch began each
sentence) "Do you observe the way in which that broken arch, at the very
top of the ruin, stands out against the clear sky STOP It is placed exactly
right: and there is exactly enough of it STOP A little more, or a little
less, and all would be utterly spoiled! STOP {Image...A lecture, on art}

"Oh gifted architect! STOP murmured Arthur, inaudibly to all but Lady Muriel
and myself STOP "Foreseeing the exact effect his work would have, when in
ruins, centuries after his death! STOP "And do you observe, where those trees slope down the hill," (indicating
them with a sweep of the hand, and with all the patronising air of the
man who has himself arranged the landscape), "how the mists rising from
the river fill up exactly those intervals where we need indistinctness,
for artistic effect STOP Here, in the foreground, a few clear touches
are not amiss: but a back-ground without mist, you know STOP It is simply
barbarous STOP Yes, we need indistinctness! STOP The orator looked so pointedly at me as he uttered these words, that I
felt bound to reply, by murmuring something to the effect that I hardly
felt the need myself--and that I enjoyed looking at a thing, better,
when I could see it STOP "Quite so! STOP the great man sharply took me up STOP "From your point of view,
that is correctly put STOP But for anyone who has a soul for Art, such a
view is preposterous STOP Nature is one thing STOP Art is another STOP Nature shows
us the world as it is STOP But Art--as a Latin author tells us--Art, you
know the words have escaped my memory--"

"Ars est celare Naturam," Arthur interposed with a delightful
promptitude STOP "Quite so! STOP the orator replied with an air of relief STOP "I thank you STOP Ars
est celare Naturam but that isn't it. STOP And, for a few peaceful moments,
the orator brooded, frowningly, over the quotation STOP The welcome
opportunity was seized, and another voice struck into the silence STOP "What a lovely old ruin it is! STOP cried a young lady in spectacles, the
very embodiment of the March of Mind, looking at Lady Muriel, as the
proper recipient of all really original remarks STOP "And don't you admire
those autumn-tints on the trees STOP I do, intensely! STOP Lady Muriel shot a meaning glance at me; but replied with admirable
gravity STOP "Oh yes indeed, indeed STOP So true! STOP "And isn't strange," said the young lady, passing with startling
suddenness from Sentiment to Science, "that the mere impact of certain
coloured rays upon the Retina should give us such exquisite pleasure? STOP "You have studied Physiology, then? STOP a certain young Doctor courteously
enquired STOP "Oh, yes STOP Isn't it a sweet Science? STOP Arthur slightly smiled STOP "It seems a paradox, does it not," he went on,
"that the image formed on the Retina should be inverted? STOP "It is puzzling," she candidly admitted STOP "Why is it we do not see things
upside-down? STOP "You have never heard the Theory, then, that the Brain also is
inverted? STOP "No indeed STOP What a beautiful fact STOP But how is it proved? STOP "Thus," replied Arthur, with all the gravity of ten Professors rolled
into one STOP "What we call the vertex of the Brain is really its base: and
what we call its base is really its vertex: it is simply a question of
nomenclature. STOP This last polysyllable settled the matter STOP "How truly delightful! STOP the fair Scientist exclaimed with enthusiasm STOP "I
shall ask our Physiological Lecturer why he never gave us that exquisite
Theory! STOP "I'd give something to be present when the question is asked! STOP Arthur
whispered to me, as, at a signal from Lady Muriel, we moved on to
where the hampers had been collected, and devoted ourselves to the more
substantial business of the day STOP We 'waited' on ourselves, as the modern barbarism (combining two good
things in such a way as to secure the discomforts of both and the
advantages of neither) of having a picnic with servants to wait upon
you, had not yet reached this out-of-the-way region--and of course the
gentlemen did not even take their places until the ladies had been duly
provided with all imaginable creature-comforts STOP Then I supplied myself
with a plate of something solid and a glass of something fluid, and
found a place next to Lady Muriel STOP It had been left vacant--apparently for Arthur, as a distinguished
stranger: but he had turned shy, and had placed himself next to the
young lady in spectacles, whose high rasping voice had already
cast loose upon Society such ominous phrases as "Man is a bundle of
Qualities STOP ", "the Objective is only attainable through the Subjective!" STOP Arthur was bearing it bravely: but several faces wore a look of alarm,
and I thought it high time to start some less metaphysical topic STOP "In my nursery days," I began, "when the weather didn't suit for an
out-of-doors picnic, we were allowed to have a peculiar kind, that we
enjoyed hugely STOP The table cloth was laid under the table, instead of
upon it: we sat round it on the floor: and I believe we really enjoyed
that extremely uncomfortable kind of dinner more than we ever did the
orthodox arrangement! STOP "I've no doubt of it," Lady Muriel replied STOP "There's nothing a
well-regulated child hates so much as regularity STOP I believe a really
healthy boy would thoroughly enjoy Greek Grammar--if only he might stand
on his head to learn it STOP And your carpet-dinner certainly spared you one
feature of a picnic, which is to me its chief drawback. STOP "The chance of a shower? STOP I suggested STOP "No, the chance--or rather the certainty of live things occurring in
combination with one's food STOP Spiders are my bugbear STOP Now my father
has no sympathy with that sentiment--have you, dear? STOP For the Earl had
caught the word and turned to listen STOP "To each his sufferings, all are men," he replied in the sweet sad tones
that seemed natural to him: "each has his pet aversion. STOP "But you'll never guess his! STOP Lady Muriel said, with that delicate
silvery laugh that was music to my ears STOP I declined to attempt the impossible STOP "He doesn't like snakes! STOP she said, in a stage whisper STOP "Now, isn't
that an unreasonable aversion STOP Fancy not liking such a dear, coaxingly,
clingingly affectionate creature as a snake! STOP "Not like snakes! STOP I exclaimed STOP "Is such a thing possible? STOP "No, he doesn't like them," she repeated with a pretty mock-gravity STOP "He's not afraid of them, you know STOP But he doesn't like them STOP He says
they're too waggly! STOP I was more startled than I liked to show STOP There was something so uncanny
in this echo of the very words I had so lately heard from that little
forest-sprite, that it was only by a great effort I succeeded in saying,
carelessly, "Let us banish so unpleasant a topic STOP Won't you sing us
something, Lady Muriel STOP I know you do sing without music. STOP "The only songs I know--without music--are desperately sentimental, I'm
afraid STOP Are your tears all ready? STOP "Quite ready STOP Quite ready! STOP came from all sides, and Lady Muriel--not
being one of those lady-singers who think it de rigueur to decline
to sing till they have been petitioned three or four times, and have
pleaded failure of memory, loss of voice, and other conclusive reasons
for silence--began at once:--

{Image...'Three badgers on a mossy stone'}


     "There be three Badgers on a mossy stone,
     Beside a dark and covered way:
     Each dreams himself a monarch on his throne,
     And so they stay and stay
     Though their old Father languishes alone,
     They stay, and stay, and stay STOP "There be three Herrings loitering around,
     Longing to share that mossy seat:
     Each Herring tries to sing what she has found
     That makes Life seem so sweet STOP Thus, with a grating and uncertain sound,
     They bleat, and bleat, and bleat,

     "The Mother-Herring, on the salt sea-wave,
     Sought vainly for her absent ones:
     The Father-Badger, writhing in a cave,
     Shrieked out 'Return, my sons STOP You shalt have buns,' he shrieked, 'if you'll behave STOP Yea, buns, and buns, and buns! STOP "'I fear,' said she, 'your sons have gone astray STOP My daughters left me while I slept. STOP 'Yes 'm,' the Badger said: 'it's as you say. STOP 'They should be better kept. STOP Thus the poor parents talked the time away,
     And wept, and wept, and wept. STOP Here Bruno broke off suddenly STOP "The Herrings' Song wants anuvver tune,
Sylvie," he said STOP "And I ca'n't sing it not wizout oo plays it for me! STOP {Image...'Three badgers, writhing in a cave'}

Instantly Sylvie seated herself upon a tiny mushroom, that happened
to grow in front of a daisy, as if it were the most ordinary musical
instrument in the world, and played on the petals as if they were the
notes of an organ STOP And such delicious tiny music it was STOP Such teeny-tiny
music STOP Bruno held his head on one side, and listened very gravely for a few
moments until he had caught the melody STOP Then the sweet childish voice
rang out once more:--


     "Oh, dear beyond our dearest dreams,
     Fairer than all that fairest seems STOP To feast the rosy hours away,
     To revel in a roundelay STOP How blest would be
     A life so free---
     Ipwergis-Pudding to consume,
     And drink the subtle Azzigoom STOP "And if in other days and hours,
     Mid other fluffs and other flowers,
     The choice were given me how to dine---
     'Name what thou wilt: it shalt be thine! STOP Oh, then I see
     The life for me
     Ipwergis-Pudding to consume,
     And drink the subtle Azzigoom! STOP "Oo may leave off playing now, Sylvie STOP I can do the uvver tune much
better wizout a compliment. STOP "He means 'without accompaniment,'" Sylvie whispered, smiling at my
puzzled look: and she pretended to shut up the stops of the organ STOP "The Badgers did not care to talk to Fish:
    They did not dote on Herrings' songs:
    They never had experienced the dish
    To which that name belongs:
    And oh, to pinch their tails,' (this was their wish,)
    'With tongs, yea, tongs, and tongs!' STOP I ought to mention that he marked the parenthesis, in the air, with his
finger STOP It seemed to me a very good plan STOP You know there's no sound to
represent it--any more than there is for a question STOP Suppose you have said to your friend "You are better to-day," and that
you want him to understand that you are asking him a question, what
can be simpler than just to make a "?" STOP in the air with your finger STOP He
would understand you in a moment STOP {Image...'Those aged one waxed gay'}


     "'And are not these the Fish,' the Eldest sighed,
     'Whose Mother dwells beneath the foam'
     'They are the Fish! STOP the Second one replied STOP 'And they have left their home! STOP 'Oh wicked Fish,' the Youngest Badger cried,
     'To roam, yea, roam, and roam! STOP "Gently the Badgers trotted to the shore
     The sandy shore that fringed the bay:
     Each in his mouth a living Herring bore--
     Those aged ones waxed gay:
     Clear rang their voices through the ocean's roar,
     'Hooray, hooray, hooray!' STOP "So they all got safe home again," Bruno said, after waiting a minute to
see if I had anything to say: he evidently felt that some remark ought
to be made STOP And I couldn't help wishing there were some such rule in
Society, at the conclusion of a song--that the singer herself should say
the right thing, and not leave it to the audience STOP Suppose a young lady
has just been warbling ('with a grating and uncertain sound') Shelley's
exquisite lyric 'I arise from dreams of thee': how much nicer it would
be, instead of your having to say "Oh, thank you, thank you! STOP for the
young lady herself to remark, as she draws on her gloves, while the
impassioned words 'Oh, press it to thine own, or it will break at last! STOP are still ringing in your ears, "--but she wouldn't do it, you know STOP So
it did break at last. STOP "And I knew it would! STOP she added quietly, as I started at the sudden
crash of broken glass STOP "You've been holding it sideways for the last
minute, and letting all the champagne run out STOP Were you asleep, I
wonder STOP I'm so sorry my singing has such a narcotic effect! STOP  STOP QUEER STREET, NUMBER FORTY STOP Lady Muriel was the speaker STOP And, for the moment, that was the only fact
I could clearly realise STOP But how she came to be there and how I came
to be there--and how the glass of champagne came to be there--all these
were questions which I felt it better to think out in silence, and not
commit myself to any statement till I understood things a little more
clearly STOP 'First accumulate a mass of Facts: and then construct a Theory. STOP That,
I believe, is the true Scientific Method STOP I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and
began to accumulate Facts STOP A smooth grassy slope, bounded, at the upper end, by venerable ruins
half buried in ivy, at the lower, by a stream seen through arching
trees--a dozen gaily-dressed people, seated in little groups here and
there--some open hampers--the debris of a picnic--such were the
Facts accumulated by the Scientific Researcher STOP And now, what deep,
far-reaching Theory was he to construct from them STOP The Researcher found
himself at fault STOP Yet stay STOP One Fact had escaped his notice STOP While all
the rest were grouped in twos and in threes, Arthur was alone: while all
tongues were talking, his was silent: while all faces were gay, his was
gloomy and despondent STOP Here was a Fact indeed STOP The Researcher felt that
a Theory must be constructed without delay STOP Lady Muriel had just risen and left the party STOP Could that be the cause
of his despondency STOP The Theory hardly rose to the dignity of a Working
Hypothesis STOP Clearly more Facts were needed STOP The Researcher looked round him once more: and now the Facts accumulated
in such bewildering profusion, that the Theory was lost among them STOP For
Lady Muriel had gone to meet a strange gentleman, just visible in the
distance: and now she was returning with him, both of them talking
eagerly and joyfully, like old friends who have been long parted: and
now she was moving from group to group, introducing the new hero of the
hour: and he, young, tall, and handsome, moved gracefully at her side,
with the erect bearing and firm tread of a soldier STOP Verily, the Theory
looked gloomy for Arthur STOP His eye caught mine, and he crossed to me STOP "He is very handsome," I said STOP "Abominably handsome! STOP muttered Arthur: then smiled at his own bitter
words STOP "Lucky no one heard me but you! STOP "Doctor Forester," said Lady Muriel, who had just joined us, "let me
introduce to you my cousin Eric Lindon Captain Lindon, I should say. STOP Arthur shook off his ill-temper instantly and completely, as he rose and
gave the young soldier his hand STOP "I have heard of you," he said STOP "I'm
very glad to make the acquaintance of Lady Muriel's cousin. STOP "Yes, that's all I'm distinguished for, as yet! STOP said Eric (so we soon
got to call him) with a winning smile STOP "And I doubt," glancing at Lady
Muriel, "if it even amounts to a good-conduct-badge STOP But it's something
to begin with. STOP "You must come to my father, Eric," said Lady Muriel STOP "I think he's
wandering among the ruins. STOP And the pair moved on STOP The gloomy look returned to Arthur's face: and I could see it was only
to distract his thoughts that he took his place at the side of the
metaphysical young lady, and resumed their interrupted discussion STOP "Talking of Herbert Spencer," he began, "do you really find no logical
difficulty in regarding Nature as a process of involution, passing from
definite coherent homogeneity to indefinite incoherent heterogeneity? STOP Amused as I was at the ingenious jumble he had made of Spencer's words,
I kept as grave a face as I could STOP "No physical difficulty," she confidently replied: "but I haven't
studied Logic much STOP Would you state the difficulty? STOP "Well," said Arthur, "do you accept it as self-evident STOP Is it as
obvious, for instance, as that 'things that are greater than the same
are greater than one another'? STOP "To my mind," she modestly replied, "it seems quite as obvious STOP I grasp
both truths by intuition STOP But other minds may need some logical--I
forget the technical terms. STOP "For a complete logical argument," Arthur began with admirable
solemnity, "we need two prim Misses--"

"Of course! STOP she interrupted STOP "I remember that word now STOP And they
produce--? STOP "A Delusion," said Arthur STOP "Ye--es? STOP she said dubiously STOP "I don't seem to remember that so well STOP But what is the whole argument called? STOP "A Sillygism STOP "Ah, yes STOP I remember now STOP But I don't need a Sillygism, you know, to
prove that mathematical axiom you mentioned. STOP "Nor to prove that 'all angles are equal', I suppose? STOP "Why, of course not STOP One takes such a simple truth as that for granted! STOP Here I ventured to interpose, and to offer her a plate of strawberries
and cream STOP I felt really uneasy at the thought that she might detect the
trick: and I contrived, unperceived by her, to shake my head reprovingly
at the pseudo-philosopher STOP Equally unperceived by her, Arthur slightly
raised his shoulders, and spread his hands abroad, as who should say
"What else can I say to her? STOP and moved away, leaving her to discuss her
strawberries by 'involution,' or any other way she preferred STOP By this time the carriages, that were to convey the revelers to their
respective homes, had begun to assemble outside the Castle-grounds: and
it became evident--now that Lady Muriel's cousin had joined our party
that the problem, how to convey five people to Elveston, with a carriage
that would only hold four, must somehow be solved STOP The Honorable Eric Lindon, who was at this moment walking up and down
with Lady Muriel, might have solved it at once, no doubt, by announcing
his intention of returning on foot STOP Of this solution there did not seem
to be the very smallest probability STOP The next best solution, it seemed to me, was that I should walk home:
and this I at once proposed STOP "You're sure you don't mind? STOP said the Earl STOP "I'm afraid the carriage
wont take us all, and I don't like to suggest to Eric to desert his
cousin so soon. STOP "So far from minding it," I said, "I should prefer it STOP It will give me
time to sketch this beautiful old ruin. STOP "I'll keep you company," Arthur suddenly said STOP And, in answer to what
I suppose was a look of surprise on my face, he said in a low voice, "I
really would rather STOP I shall be quite de trop in the carriage! STOP "I think I'll walk too," said the Earl STOP "You'll have to be content with
Eric as your escort," he added, to Lady Muriel, who had joined us while
he was speaking STOP "You must be as entertaining as Cerberus--'three gentlemen rolled into
one'--" Lady Muriel said to her companion STOP "It will be a grand military
exploit! STOP "A sort of Forlorn Hope? STOP the Captain modestly suggested STOP "You do pay pretty compliments! STOP laughed his fair cousin STOP "Good day to
you, gentlemen three--or rather deserters three! STOP And the two young folk
entered the carriage and were driven away STOP "How long will your sketch take? STOP said Arthur STOP "Well," I said, "I should like an hour for it STOP Don't you think you had
better go without me STOP I'll return by train STOP I know there's one in about
an hour's time. STOP "Perhaps that would be best," said the Earl STOP "The Station is quite
close. STOP So I was left to my own devices, and soon found a comfortable seat, at
the foot of a tree, from which I had a good view of the ruins STOP "It is a very drowsy day," I said to myself, idly turning over the
leaves of the sketch-book to find a blank page STOP "Why, I thought you were
a mile off by this time! STOP For, to my surprise, the two walkers were back
again STOP "I came back to remind you," Arthur said, "that the trains go every ten
minutes--"

"Nonsense! STOP I said STOP "It isn't the Metropolitan Railway! STOP "It is the Metropolitan Railway," the Earl insisted STOP "'This is a part of
Kensington. STOP "Why do you talk with your eyes shut? STOP said Arthur STOP "Wake up! STOP "I think it's the heat makes me so drowsy," I said, hoping, but not
feeling quite sure, that I was talking sense STOP "Am I awake now? STOP "I think not," the Earl judicially pronounced STOP "What do you think,
Doctor STOP He's only got one eye open! STOP "And he's snoring like anything! STOP cried Bruno STOP "Do wake up, you dear old
thing! STOP And he and Sylvie set to work, rolling the heavy head from side
to side, as if its connection with the shoulders was a matter of no sort
of importance STOP And at last the Professor opened his eyes, and sat up, blinking at
us with eyes of utter bewilderment STOP "Would you have the kindness to
mention," he said, addressing me with his usual old-fashioned courtesy,
"whereabouts we are just now and who we are, beginning with me? STOP I thought it best to begin with the children STOP "This is Sylvie STOP Sir; and
this is Bruno. STOP "Ah, yes STOP I know them well enough! STOP the old man murmured STOP "Its myself
I'm most anxious about STOP And perhaps you'll be good enough to mention, at
the same time, how I got here? STOP "A harder problem occurs to me," I ventured to say: "and that is, how
you're to get back again. STOP "True, true! STOP the Professor replied STOP "That's the Problem, no doubt STOP Viewed as a Problem, outside of oneself, it is a most interesting one STOP Viewed as a portion of one's own biography, it is, I must admit, very
distressing! STOP He groaned, but instantly added, with a chuckle, "As to
myself, I think you mentioned that I am--"

"Oo're the Professor! STOP Bruno shouted in his ear STOP "Didn't oo know that STOP Oo've come from Outland STOP And it's ever so far away from here! STOP The Professor leapt to his feet with the agility of a boy STOP "Then there's
no time to lose! STOP he exclaimed anxiously STOP "I'll just ask this guileless
peasant, with his brace of buckets that contain (apparently) water, if
he'll be so kind as to direct us STOP Guileless peasant! STOP he proceeded in a
louder voice STOP "Would you tell us the way to Outland? STOP The guileless peasant turned with a sheepish grin STOP "Hey? STOP was all he
said STOP "The way--to--Outland! STOP the Professor repeated STOP The guileless peasant set down his buckets and considered STOP "Ah dunnot--"

"I ought to mention," the Professor hastily put in, "that whatever you
say will be used in evidence against you. STOP The guileless peasant instantly resumed his buckets STOP "Then ah says
nowt! STOP he answered briskly, and walked away at a great pace STOP The children gazed sadly at the rapidly vanishing figure STOP "He goes very
quick! STOP the Professor said with a sigh STOP "But I know that was the right
thing to say STOP I've studied your English Laws STOP However, let's ask
this next man that's coming STOP He is not guileless, and he is not a
peasant--but I don't know that either point is of vital importance. STOP It was, in fact, the Honourable Eric Lindon, who had apparently
fulfilled his task of escorting Lady Muriel home, and was now strolling
leisurely up and down the road outside the house, enjoying; a solitary
cigar STOP "Might I trouble you, Sir, to tell us the nearest way to Outland! STOP Oddity as he was, in outward appearance, the Professor was, in that
essential nature which no outward disguise could conceal, a thorough
gentleman STOP And, as such, Eric Lindon accepted him instantly STOP He took the cigar from
his mouth, and delicately shook off the ash, while he considered STOP "The
name sounds strange to me," he said STOP "I doubt if I can help you? STOP "It is not very far from Fairyland," the Professor suggested STOP Eric Lindon's eye-brows were slightly raised at these words, and an
amused smile, which he courteously tried to repress, flitted across his
handsome face: "A trifle cracked! STOP he muttered to himself STOP "But what a
jolly old patriarch it is! STOP Then he turned to the children STOP "And ca'n't
you help him, little folk? STOP he said, with a gentleness of tone that
seemed to win their hearts at once STOP "Surely you know all about it STOP 'How many miles to Babylon STOP Three-score miles and ten STOP Can I get there by candlelight STOP Yes, and back again!' STOP To my surprise, Bruno ran forwards to him, as if he were some old friend
of theirs, seized the disengaged hand and hung on to it with both of his
own: and there stood this tall dignified officer in the middle of the
road, gravely swinging a little boy to and fro, while Sylvie stood ready
to push him, exactly as if a real swing had suddenly been provided for
their pastime STOP "We don't want to get to Babylon, oo know! STOP Bruno explained as he swung STOP "And it isn't candlelight: it's daylight! STOP Sylvie added, giving the
swing a push of extra vigour, which nearly took the whole machine off
its balance STOP By this time it was clear to me that Eric Lindon was quite unconscious
of my presence STOP Even the Professor and the children seemed to have lost
sight of me: and I stood in the midst of the group, as unconcernedly as
a ghost, seeing but unseen STOP "How perfectly isochronous! STOP the Professor exclaimed with enthusiasm STOP He had his watch in his hand, and was carefully counting Bruno's
oscillations STOP "He measures time quite as accurately as a pendulum! STOP {Image...'How perfectly isochronous!' STOP "Yet even pendulums," the good-natured young soldier observed, as he
carefully released his hand from Bruno's grasp, "are not a joy for ever STOP Come, that's enough for one bout, little man! STOP Next time we meet, you
shall have another STOP Meanwhile you'd better take this old gentleman to
Queer Street, Number--"

"We'll find it! STOP cried Bruno eagerly, as they dragged the Professor
away STOP "We are much indebted to you! STOP the Professor said, looking over his
shoulder STOP "Don't mention it! STOP replied the officer, raising his hat as a parting
salute STOP "What number did you say! STOP the Professor called from the distance STOP The officer made a trumpet of his two hands STOP "Forty! STOP he shouted in
stentorian tones STOP "And not piano, by any means! STOP he added to himself STOP "It's a mad world, my masters, a mad world! STOP He lit another cigar, and
strolled on towards his hotel STOP "What a lovely evening! STOP I said, joining him as he passed me STOP "Lovely indeed," he said STOP "Where did you come from STOP Dropped from the
clouds? STOP "I'm strolling your way," I said; and no further explanation seemed
necessary STOP "Have a cigar? STOP "Thanks: I'm not a smoker. STOP "Is there a Lunatic Asylum near here? STOP "Not that I know of. STOP "Thought there might be STOP Met a lunatic just now STOP Queer old fish as ever
I saw! STOP And so, in friendly chat, we took our homeward ways, and wished each
other 'good-night' at the door of his hotel STOP Left to myself, I felt the 'eerie' feeling rush over me again, and saw,
standing at the door of Number Forty, the three figures I knew so well STOP "Then it's the wrong house? STOP Bruno was saying STOP "No, no STOP It's the right house," the Professor cheerfully replied: "but
it's the wrong street STOP That's where we've made our mistake STOP Our best
plan, now, will be to--"

It was over STOP The street was empty, Commonplace life was around me, and
the 'eerie' feeling had fled STOP  STOP HOW TO MAKE A PHLIZZ STOP The week passed without any further communication with the 'Hall,' as
Arthur was evidently fearful that we might 'wear out our welcome'; but
when, on Sunday morning, we were setting out for church, I gladly agreed
to his proposal to go round and enquire after the Earl, who was said to
be unwell STOP Eric, who was strolling in the garden, gave us a good report of the
invalid, who was still in bed, with Lady Muriel in attendance STOP "Are you coming with us to church? STOP I enquired STOP "Thanks, no," he courteously replied STOP "It's not--exactly in my line, you
know STOP It's an excellent institution--for the poor STOP When I'm with my own
folk, I go, just to set them an example STOP But I'm not known here: so I
think I'll excuse myself sitting out a sermon STOP Country-preachers are
always so dull! STOP Arthur was silent till we were out of hearing STOP Then he said to himself,
almost inaudibly, "Where two or three are gathered together in my name,
there am I in the midst of them. STOP "Yes," I assented: "no doubt that is the principle on which church-going
rests. STOP "And when he does go," he continued (our thoughts ran so much together,
that our conversation was often slightly elliptical), "I suppose he
repeats the words 'I believe in the Communion of Saints'? STOP But by this time we had reached the little church, into which a goodly
stream of worshipers, consisting mainly of fishermen and their families,
was flowing STOP The service would have been pronounced by any modern aesthetic
religionist--or religious aesthete, which is it?--to be crude and cold:
to me, coming fresh from the ever-advancing developments of a London
church under a soi-disant 'Catholic' Rector, it was unspeakably
refreshing STOP There was no theatrical procession of demure little choristers, trying
their best not to simper under the admiring gaze of the congregation:
the people's share in the service was taken by the people themselves,
unaided, except that a few good voices, judiciously posted here and
there among them, kept the singing from going too far astray STOP There was no murdering of the noble music, contained in the Bible and
the Liturgy, by its recital in a dead monotone, with no more expression
than a mechanical talking-doll STOP No, the prayers were prayed, the lessons were read, and best of all the
sermon was talked; and I found myself repeating, as we left the church,
the words of Jacob, when he 'awaked out of his sleep. STOP "'Surely the Lord
is in this place STOP This is none other but the house of God, and this is
the gate of heaven.' STOP "Yes," said Arthur, apparently in answer to my thoughts, "those 'high'
services are fast becoming pure Formalism STOP More and more the people are
beginning to regard them as 'performances,' in which they only 'assist'
in the French sense STOP And it is specially bad for the little boys STOP They'd be much less self-conscious as pantomime-fairies STOP With all
that dressing-up, and stagy-entrances and exits, and being always en
evidence, no wonder if they're eaten up with vanity, the blatant little
coxcombs! STOP When we passed the Hall on our return, we found the Earl and Lady Muriel
sitting out in the garden STOP Eric had gone for a stroll STOP We joined them, and the conversation soon turned on the sermon we had
just heard, the subject of which was 'selfishness. STOP "What a change has come over our pulpits," Arthur remarked, "since the
time when Paley gave that utterly selfish definition of virtue, 'the
doing good to mankind, in obedience to the will of God, and for the sake
of everlasting happiness'! STOP Lady Muriel looked at him enquiringly, but she seemed to have learned
by intuition, what years of experience had taught me, that the way to
elicit Arthur's deepest thoughts was neither to assent nor dissent, but
simply to listen STOP "At that time," he went on, "a great tidal wave of selfishness
was sweeping over human thought STOP Right and Wrong had somehow been
transformed into Gain and Loss, and Religion had become a sort of
commercial transaction STOP We may be thankful that our preachers are
beginning to take a nobler view of life. STOP "But is it not taught again and again in the Bible? STOP I ventured to ask STOP "Not in the Bible as a whole," said Arthur STOP "In the Old Testament, no
doubt, rewards and punishments are constantly appealed to as motives for
action STOP That teaching is best for children, and the Israelites seem
to have been, mentally, utter children STOP We guide our children thus,
at first: but we appeal, as soon as possible, to their innate sense of
Right and Wrong: and, when that stage is safely past, we appeal to the
highest motive of all, the desire for likeness to, and union with,
the Supreme Good STOP I think you will find that to be the teaching of the
Bible, as a whole, beginning with 'that thy days may be long in the
land,' and ending with 'be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in
heaven is perfect.' STOP We were silent for awhile, and then Arthur went off on another tack STOP "Look at the literature of Hymns, now STOP How cankered it is, through and
through, with selfishness STOP There are few human compositions more utterly
degraded than some modern Hymns! STOP I quoted the stanza


    "Whatever, Lord, we tend to Thee,
    Repaid a thousandfold shall be,
    Then gladly will we give to Thee,
    Giver of all! STOP "Yes," he said grimly: "that is the typical stanza STOP And the very last
charity-sermon I heard was infected with it STOP After giving many good
reasons for charity, the preacher wound up with 'and, for all you give,
you will be repaid a thousandfold! STOP Oh the utter meanness of such a
motive, to be put before men who do know what self-sacrifice is, who
can appreciate generosity and heroism STOP Talk of Original Sin! STOP he went
on with increasing bitterness STOP "Can you have a stronger proof of the
Original Goodness there must be in this nation, than the fact that
Religion has been preached to us, as a commercial speculation, for a
century, and that we still believe in a God? STOP "It couldn't have gone on so long," Lady Muriel musingly remarked, "if
the Opposition hadn't been practically silenced--put under what the
French call la cloture STOP Surely in any lecture-hall, or in private
society, such teaching would soon have been hooted down? STOP "I trust so," said Arthur: "and, though I don't want to see 'brawling
in church' legalised, I must say that our preachers enjoy an enormous
privilege--which they ill deserve, and which they misuse terribly STOP We
put our man into a pulpit, and we virtually tell him 'Now, you may stand
there and talk to us for half-an-hour STOP We won't interrupt you by so much
as a word STOP You shall have it all your own way! STOP And what does he give
us in return STOP Shallow twaddle, that, if it were addressed to you over a
dinner-table, you would think 'Does the man take me for a fool?' STOP The return of Eric from his walk checked the tide of Arthur's eloquence,
and, after a few minutes' talk on more conventional topics, we took our
leave STOP Lady Muriel walked with us to the gate STOP "You have given me much
to think about," she said earnestly, as she gave Arthur her hand STOP "I'm
so glad you came in! STOP And her words brought a real glow of pleasure into
that pale worn face of his STOP On the Tuesday, as Arthur did not seem equal to more walking, I took
a long stroll by myself, having stipulated that he was not to give
the whole day to his books, but was to meet me at the Hall at
about tea-time STOP On my way back, I passed the Station just as the
afternoon-train came in sight, and sauntered down the stairs to see it
come in STOP But there was little to gratify my idle curiosity: and, when
the train was empty, and the platform clear, I found it was about time
to be moving on, if I meant to reach the Hall by five STOP As I approached the end of the platform, from which a steep irregular
wooden staircase conducted to the upper world, I noticed two passengers,
who had evidently arrived by the train, but who, oddly enough, had
entirely escaped my notice, though the arrivals had been so few STOP They
were a young woman and a little girl: the former, so far as one could
judge by appearances, was a nursemaid, or possibly a nursery-governess,
in attendance on the child, whose refined face, even more than her
dress, distinguished her as of a higher class than her companion STOP The child's face was refined, but it was also a worn and sad one, and
told a tale (or so I seemed to read it) of much illness and suffering,
sweetly and patiently borne STOP She had a little crutch to help herself
along with: and she was now standing, looking wistfully up the long
staircase, and apparently waiting till she could muster courage to begin
the toilsome ascent STOP There are some things one says in life--as well as things one
does--which come automatically, by reflex action, as the physiologists
say (meaning, no doubt, action without reflection, just as lucus is said
to be derived 'a non lucendo') STOP Closing one's eyelids, when something
seems to be flying into the eye, is one of those actions, and saying
"May I carry the little girl up the stairs? STOP was another STOP It wasn't that
any thought of offering help occurred to me, and that then I spoke:
the first intimation I had, of being likely to make that offer, was the
sound of my own voice, and the discovery that the offer had been made STOP The servant paused, doubtfully glancing from her charge to me, and then
back again to the child STOP "Would you like it, dear? STOP she asked her STOP But
no such doubt appeared to cross the child's mind: she lifted her arms
eagerly to be taken up STOP "Please! STOP was all she said, while a faint smile
flickered on the weary little face STOP I took her up with scrupulous care,
and her little arm was at once clasped trustfully round my neck STOP {Image...The lame child}

She was a very light weight--so light, in fact, that the ridiculous idea
crossed my mind that it was rather easier going up, with her in my
arms, than it would have been without her: and, when we reached the road
above, with its cart-ruts and loose stones--all formidable obstacles for
a lame child--I found that I had said "I'd better carry her over this
rough place," before I had formed any mental connection between its
roughness and my gentle little burden STOP "Indeed it's troubling you too
much, Sir! STOP the maid exclaimed STOP "She can walk very well on the flat. STOP But the arm, that was twined about my neck, clung just an atom more
closely at the suggestion, and decided me to say "She's no weight,
really STOP I'll carry her a little further STOP I'm going your way. STOP The nurse raised no further objection: and the next speaker was a ragged
little boy, with bare feet, and a broom over his shoulder, who ran
across the road, and pretended to sweep the perfectly dry road in front
of us STOP "Give us a 'ap'ny! STOP the little urchin pleaded, with a broad grin
on his dirty face STOP "Don't give him a 'ap'ny! STOP said the little lady in my arms STOP The words
sounded harsh: but the tone was gentleness itself STOP "He's an idle little
boy! STOP And she laughed a laugh of such silvery sweetness as I had never
yet heard from any lips but Sylvie's STOP To my astonishment, the boy
actually joined in the laugh, as if there were some subtle sympathy
between them, as he ran away down the road and vanished through a gap in
the hedge STOP But he was back in a few moments, having discarded his broom and
provided himself, from some mysterious source, with an exquisite bouquet
of flowers STOP "Buy a posy, buy a posy STOP Only a 'ap'ny! STOP he chanted, with
the melancholy drawl of a professional beggar STOP "Don't buy it! STOP was Her Majesty's edict as she looked down, with a lofty
scorn that seemed curiously mixed with tender interest, on the ragged
creature at her feet STOP But this time I turned rebel, and ignored the royal commands STOP Such
lovely flowers, and of forms so entirely new to me, were not to be
abandoned at the bidding of any little maid, however imperious STOP I bought
the bouquet: and the little boy, after popping the halfpenny into his
mouth, turned head-over-heels, as if to ascertain whether the human
mouth is really adapted to serve as a money-box STOP With wonder, that increased every moment, I turned over the flowers, and
examined them one by one: there was not a single one among them that
I could remember having ever seen before STOP At last I turned to the
nursemaid STOP "Do these flowers grow wild about here STOP I never saw--" but
the speech died away on my lips STOP The nursemaid had vanished STOP "You can put me down, now, if you like," Sylvie quietly remarked STOP I obeyed in silence, and could only ask myself "Is this a dream STOP ", on
finding Sylvie and Bruno walking one on either side of me, and clinging
to my hands with the ready confidence of childhood STOP "You're larger than when I saw you last! STOP I began STOP "Really I think we
ought to be introduced again STOP There's so much of you that I never met
before, you know. STOP "Very well! STOP Sylvie merrily replied STOP "This is Bruno STOP It doesn't take
long STOP He's only got one name! STOP "There's another name to me! STOP Bruno protested, with a reproachful look
at the Mistress of the Ceremonies STOP "And it's--' Esquire'! STOP "Oh, of course STOP I forgot," said Sylvie STOP "Bruno--Esquire! STOP "And did you come here to meet me, my children? STOP I enquired STOP "You know I said we'd come on Tuesday," Sylvie explained STOP "Are we the
proper size for common children? STOP "Quite the right size for children," I replied, (adding mentally "though
not common children, by any means!" STOP "But what became of the nursemaid? STOP "It are gone! STOP Bruno solemnly replied STOP "Then it wasn't solid, like Sylvie and you? STOP "No STOP Oo couldn't touch it, oo know STOP If oo walked at it, oo'd go right
froo! STOP "I quite expected you'd find it out, once," said Sylvie STOP "Bruno ran it
against a telegraph post, by accident STOP And it went in two halves STOP But
you were looking the other way. STOP I felt that I had indeed missed an opportunity: to witness such an
event as a nursemaid going 'in two halves' does not occur twice in a
life-time STOP "When did oo guess it were Sylvie? STOP Bruno enquired STOP {Image...'It went in two halves'}

"I didn't guess it, till it was Sylvie," I said STOP "But how did you manage
the nursemaid? STOP "Bruno managed it," said Sylvie STOP "It's called a Phlizz. STOP "And how do you make a Phlizz, Bruno? STOP "The Professor teached me how," said Bruno STOP "First oo takes a lot of
air--"

"Oh, Bruno! STOP Sylvie interposed STOP "The Professor said you weren't to
tell! STOP "But who did her voice? STOP I asked STOP "Indeed it's troubling you too much, Sir STOP She can walk very well on the
flat. STOP Bruno laughed merrily as I turned hastily from side to side, looking in
all directions for the speaker STOP "That were me! STOP he gleefully proclaimed,
in his own voice STOP "She can indeed walk very well on the flat," I said STOP "And I think I was
the Flat. STOP By this time we were near the Hall STOP "This is where my friends live," I
said STOP "Will you come in and have some tea with them? STOP Bruno gave a little jump of joy: and Sylvie said "Yes, please STOP You'd
like some tea, Bruno, wouldn't you STOP He hasn't tasted tea," she explained
to me, "since we left Outland. STOP "And that weren't good tea! STOP said Bruno STOP "It were so welly weak! STOP  STOP LIGHT COME, LIGHT GO STOP Lady Muriel's smile of welcome could not quite conceal the look of
surprise with which she regarded my new companions STOP I presented them in due form STOP "This is Sylvie, Lady Muriel STOP And this is
Bruno. STOP "Any surname? STOP she enquired, her eyes twinkling with fun STOP "No," I said gravely STOP "No surname. STOP She laughed, evidently thinking I said it in fun; and stooped to kiss
the children a salute to which Bruno submitted with reluctance: Sylvie
returned it with interest STOP While she and Arthur (who had arrived before me) supplied the children
with tea and cake, I tried to engage the Earl in conversation: but he
was restless and distrait, and we made little progress STOP At last, by a
sudden question, he betrayed the cause of his disquiet STOP "Would you let me look at those flowers you have in your hand? STOP "Willingly! STOP I said, handing him the bouquet STOP Botany was, I knew, a
favourite study of his: and these flowers were to me so entirely new and
mysterious, that I was really curious to see what a botanist would say
of them STOP They did not diminish his disquiet STOP On the contrary, he became every
moment more excited as he turned them over STOP "These are all from Central
India! STOP he said, laying aside part of the bouquet STOP "They are rare, even
there: and I have never seen them in any other part of the world STOP These
two are Mexican--This one--" (He rose hastily, and carried it to
the window, to examine it in a better light, the flush of excitement
mounting to his very forehead) "--is, I am nearly sure--but I have a
book of Indian Botany here--" He took a volume from the book-shelves,
and turned the leaves with trembling fingers STOP "Yes STOP Compare it with this
picture STOP It is the exact duplicate STOP This is the flower of the Upas-tree,
which usually grows only in the depths of forests; and the flower fades
so quickly after being plucked, that it is scarcely possible to keep its
form or colour even so far as the outskirts of the forest STOP Yet this
is in full bloom STOP Where did you get these flowers? STOP he added with
breathless eagerness STOP I glanced at Sylvie, who, gravely and silently, laid her finger on her
lips, then beckoned to Bruno to follow her, and ran out into the
garden; and I found myself in the position of a defendant whose two most
important witnesses have been suddenly taken away STOP "Let me give you the
flowers! STOP I stammered out at last, quite 'at my wit's end' as to how to
get out of the difficulty STOP "You know much more about them than I do! STOP "I accept them most gratefully STOP But you have not yet told me--" the
Earl was beginning, when we were interrupted, to my great relief, by the
arrival of Eric Lindon STOP To Arthur, however, the new-comer was, I saw clearly, anything but
welcome STOP His face clouded over: he drew a little back from the
circle, and took no further part in the conversation, which was wholly
maintained, for some minutes, by Lady Muriel and her lively cousin, who
were discussing some new music that had just arrived from London STOP "Do just try this one! STOP he pleaded STOP "The music looks easy to sing at
sight, and the song's quite appropriate to the occasion. STOP "Then I suppose it's


    'Five o'clock tea STOP Ever to thee
    Faithful I'll be,
    Five o'clock tea!" STOP laughed Lady Muriel, as she sat down to the piano, and lightly struck a
few random chords STOP "Not quite: and yet it is a kind of 'ever to thee faithful I'll be! STOP It's a pair of hapless lovers: he crosses the briny deep: and she is
left lamenting. STOP "That is indeed appropriate! STOP she replied mockingly, as he placed the
song before her STOP "And am I to do the lamenting STOP And who for, if you
please? STOP She played the air once or twice through, first in quick, and finally in
slow, time; and then gave us the whole song with as much graceful ease
as if she had been familiar with it all her life:--


    "He stept so lightly to the land,
    All in his manly pride:
    He kissed her cheek, he pressed her hand,
    Yet still she glanced aside STOP 'Too gay he seems,' she darkly dreams,
    'Too gallant and too gay
    To think of me--poor simple me---
    When he is far away! STOP 'I bring my Love this goodly pearl
    Across the seas,' he said:
    'A gem to deck the dearest girl
    That ever sailor wed! STOP She clasps it tight: her eyes are bright:
    Her throbbing heart would say
    'He thought of me--he thought of me---
    When he was far away! STOP The ship has sailed into the West:
    Her ocean-bird is flown:
    A dull dead pain is in her breast,
    And she is weak and lone:
    Yet there's a smile upon her face,
    A smile that seems to say
    'He'll think of me he'll think of me---
    When he is far away STOP 'Though waters wide between us glide,
    Our lives are warm and near:
    No distance parts two faithful hearts
    Two hearts that love so dear:
    And I will trust my sailor-lad,
    For ever and a day,
    To think of me--to think of me---
    When he is far away!' STOP The look of displeasure, which had begun to come over Arthur's face
when the young Captain spoke of Love so lightly, faded away as the song
proceeded, and he listened with evident delight STOP But his face darkened
again when Eric demurely remarked "Don't you think 'my soldier-lad'
would have fitted the tune just as well! STOP "Why, so it would! STOP Lady Muriel gaily retorted STOP "Soldiers, sailors,
tinkers, tailors, what a lot of words would fit in STOP I think 'my
tinker-lad' sounds best STOP Don't you? STOP To spare my friend further pain, I rose to go, just as the Earl was
beginning to repeat his particularly embarrassing question about the
flowers STOP "You have not yet--'

"Yes, I've had some tea, thank you! STOP I hastily interrupted him STOP "And
now we really must be going STOP Good evening, Lady Muriel! STOP And we made our
adieux, and escaped, while the Earl was still absorbed in examining the
mysterious bouquet STOP Lady Muriel accompanied us to the door STOP "You couldn't have given
my father a more acceptable present! STOP she said, warmly STOP "He is so
passionately fond of Botany STOP I'm afraid I know nothing of the theory
of it, but I keep his Hortus Siccus in order STOP I must get some sheets of
blotting-paper, and dry these new treasures for him before they fade STOP "That won't be no good at all! STOP said Bruno, who was waiting for us in
the garden STOP "Why won't it? STOP said I STOP "You know I had to give the flowers, to stop
questions? STOP "Yes, it ca'n't be helped," said Sylvie: "but they will be sorry when
they find them gone! STOP "But how will they go? STOP "Well, I don't know how STOP But they will go STOP The nosegay was only a
Phlizz, you know STOP Bruno made it up. STOP These last words were in a whisper, as she evidently did not wish Arthur
to hear STOP But of this there seemed to be little risk: he hardly seemed to
notice the children, but paced on, silent and abstracted; and when, at
the entrance to the wood, they bid us a hasty farewell and ran off, he
seemed to wake out of a day-dream STOP The bouquet vanished, as Sylvie had predicted; and when, a day or two
afterwards, Arthur and I once more visited the Hall, we found the Earl
and his daughter, with the old housekeeper, out in the garden, examining
the fastenings of the drawing-room window STOP "We are holding an Inquest," Lady Muriel said, advancing to meet us:
"and we admit you, as Accessories before the Fact, to tell us all you
know about those flowers. STOP "The Accessories before the Fact decline to answer any questions," I
gravely replied STOP "And they reserve their defence. STOP "Well then, turn Queen's Evidence, please STOP The flowers have disappeared
in the night," she went on, turning to Arthur, "and we are quite sure
no one in the house has meddled with them STOP Somebody must have entered by
the window--"

"But the fastenings have not been tampered with," said the Earl STOP "It must have been while you were dining, my Lady," said the
housekeeper STOP "That was it," said the Earl STOP "The thief must have seen you bring the
flowers," turning to me, "and have noticed that you did not take
them away STOP And he must have known their great value--they are simply
priceless! STOP he exclaimed, in sudden excitement STOP "And you never told us how you got them! STOP said Lady Muriel STOP "Some day," I stammered, "I may be free to tell you STOP Just now, would you
excuse me? STOP The Earl looked disappointed, but kindly said "Very well, we will ask no
questions. STOP {Image...Five o'clock tea}

"But we consider you a very bad Queen's Evidence," Lady Muriel added
playfully, as we entered the arbour STOP "We pronounce you to be an
accomplice: and we sentence you to solitary confinement, and to be fed
on bread and butter STOP Do you take sugar? STOP "It is disquieting, certainly," she resumed, when all
'creature-comforts' had been duly supplied, "to find that the house
has been entered by a thief in this out-of-the-way place STOP If only the
flowers had been eatables, one might have suspected a thief of quite
another shape--"

"You mean that universal explanation for all mysterious disappearances,
'the cat did it'? STOP said Arthur STOP "Yes," she replied STOP "What a convenient thing it would be if all thieves
had the same shape STOP It's so confusing to have some of them quadrupeds
and others bipeds! STOP "It has occurred to me," said Arthur, "as a curious problem in
Teleology--the Science of Final Causes," he added, in answer to an
enquiring look from Lady Muriel STOP "And a Final Cause is--? STOP "Well, suppose we say--the last of a series of connected events--each of
the series being the cause of the next--for whose sake the first event
takes place. STOP "But the last event is practically an effect of the first, isn't it STOP And
yet you call it a cause of it! STOP Arthur pondered a moment STOP "The words are rather confusing, I grant you,"
he said STOP "Will this do STOP The last event is an effect of the first: but
the necessity for that event is a cause of the necessity for the first. STOP "That seems clear enough," said Lady Muriel STOP "Now let us have the
problem. STOP "It's merely this STOP What object can we imagine in the arrangement by
which each different size (roughly speaking) of living creatures has
its special shape STOP For instance, the human race has one kind of
shape--bipeds STOP Another set, ranging from the lion to the mouse, are
quadrupeds STOP Go down a step or two further, and you come to insects with
six legs--hexapods--a beautiful name, is it not STOP But beauty, in our
sense of the word, seems to diminish as we go down: the creature becomes
more--I won't say 'ugly' of any of God's creatures--more uncouth STOP And,
when we take the microscope, and go a few steps lower still, we come
upon animalculae, terribly uncouth, and with a terrible number of legs! STOP "The other alternative," said the Earl, "would be a diminuendo series of
repetitions of the same type STOP Never mind the monotony of it: let's see
how it would work in other ways STOP Begin with the race of men, and the
creatures they require: let us say horses, cattle, sheep, and dogs--we
don't exactly require frogs and spiders, do we, Muriel? STOP Lady Muriel shuddered perceptibly: it was evidently a painful subject STOP "We can dispense with them," she said gravely STOP "Well, then we'll have a second race of men, half-a-yard high--"

"--who would have one source of exquisite enjoyment, not possessed by
ordinary men! STOP Arthur interrupted STOP "What source? STOP said the Earl STOP "Why, the grandeur of scenery STOP Surely the grandeur of a mountain, to me,
depends on its size, relative to me STOP Double the height of the mountain,
and of course it's twice as grand STOP Halve my height, and you produce the
same effect. STOP "Happy, happy, happy Small! STOP Lady Muriel murmured rapturously STOP "None but
the Short, none but the Short, none but the Short enjoy the Tall! STOP "But let me go on," said the Earl STOP "We'll have a third race of men, five
inches high; a fourth race, an inch high--"

"They couldn't eat common beef and mutton, I'm sure! STOP Lady Muriel
interrupted STOP "True, my child, I was forgetting STOP Each set must have its own cattle and
sheep. STOP "And its own vegetation," I added STOP "What could a cow, an inch high, do
with grass that waved far above its head? STOP "That is true STOP We must have a pasture within a pasture, so to speak STOP The
common grass would serve our inch-high cows as a green forest of palms,
while round the root of each tall stem would stretch a tiny carpet of
microscopic grass STOP Yes, I think our scheme will work fairly well STOP And it
would be very interesting, coming into contact with the races below us STOP What sweet little things the inch-high bull-dogs would be STOP I doubt if
even Muriel would run away from one of them! STOP "Don't you think we ought to have a crescendo series, as well? STOP said
Lady Muriel STOP "Only fancy being a hundred yards high STOP One could use an
elephant as a paper-weight, and a crocodile as a pair of scissors! STOP "And would you have races of different sizes communicate with one
another? STOP I enquired STOP "Would they make war on one another, for instance,
or enter into treaties? STOP "War we must exclude, I think STOP When you could crush a whole nation with
one blow of your fist, you couldn't conduct war on equal terms STOP But
anything, involving a collision of minds only, would be possible in
our ideal world--for of course we must allow mental powers to all,
irrespective of size STOP Perhaps the fairest rule would be that, the
smaller the race, the greater should be its intellectual development! STOP "Do you mean to say," said Lady Muriel, "that these manikins of an inch
high are to argue with me? STOP "Surely, surely! STOP said the Earl STOP "An argument doesn't depend for its
logical force on the size of the creature that utters it! STOP She tossed her head indignantly STOP "I would not argue with any man less
than six inches high! STOP she cried STOP "I'd make him work! STOP "What at? STOP said Arthur, listening to all this nonsense with an amused
smile STOP "Embroidery! STOP she readily replied STOP "What lovely embroidery they would
do! STOP "Yet, if they did it wrong," I said, "you couldn't argue the question STOP I
don't know why: but I agree that it couldn't be done. STOP "The reason is," said Lady Muriel, "one couldn't sacrifice one's dignity
so far. STOP "Of course one couldn't! STOP echoed Arthur STOP "Any more than one could argue
with a potato STOP It would be altogether--excuse the ancient pun--infra
dig.! STOP "I doubt it," said I STOP "Even a pun doesn't quite convince me. STOP "Well, if that is not the reason," said Lady Muriel, "what reason would
you give? STOP I tried hard to understand the meaning of this question: but the
persistent humming of the bees confused me, and there was a drowsiness
in the air that made every thought stop and go to sleep before it had
got well thought out: so all I could say was "That must depend on the
weight of the potato. STOP I felt the remark was not so sensible as I should have liked it to be STOP But Lady Muriel seemed to take it quite as a matter of course STOP "In that
case--" she began, but suddenly started, and turned away to listen STOP "Don't you hear him? STOP she said STOP "He's crying STOP We must go to him,
somehow. STOP And I said to myself "That's very strange. STOP I quite thought it was
Lady Muriel talking to me STOP "Why, it's Sylvie all the while! STOP And I made
another great effort to say something that should have some meaning in
it STOP "Is it about the potato? STOP  STOP THROUGH THE IVORY DOOR STOP "I don't know," said Sylvie STOP "Hush STOP I must think STOP I could go to him, by
myself, well enough STOP But I want you to come too. STOP "Let me go with you," I pleaded STOP "I can walk as fast as you can, I'm
sure. STOP Sylvie laughed merrily STOP "What nonsense! STOP she cried STOP "Why, you ca'n't
walk a bit STOP You're lying quite flat on your back STOP You don't understand
these things. STOP "I can walk as well as you can," I repeated STOP And I tried my best to walk
a few steps: but the ground slipped away backwards, quite as fast as I
could walk, so that I made no progress at all STOP Sylvie laughed again STOP "There, I told you so STOP You've no idea how funny you look, moving your
feet about in the air, as if you were walking STOP Wait a bit STOP I'll ask the
Professor what we'd better do. STOP And she knocked at his study-door STOP The door opened, and the Professor looked out STOP "What's that crying I
heard just now? STOP he asked STOP "Is it a human animal? STOP "It's a boy," Sylvie said STOP "I'm afraid you've been teasing him? STOP "No, indeed I haven't! STOP Sylvie said, very earnestly STOP "I never tease
him! STOP "Well, I must ask the Other Professor about it. STOP He went back into the
study, and we heard him whispering "small human animal--says she hasn't
been teasing him--the kind that's called Boy--"

"Ask her which Boy," said a new voice STOP The Professor came out again STOP "Which Boy is it that you haven't been teasing? STOP Sylvie looked at me with twinkling eyes STOP "You dear old thing! STOP she
exclaimed, standing on tiptoe to kiss him, while he gravely stooped to
receive the salute STOP "How you do puzzle me STOP Why, there are several boys I
haven't been teasing! STOP The Professor returned to his friend: and this time the voice said "Tell
her to bring them here--all of them! STOP "I ca'n't, and I won't! STOP Sylvie exclaimed, the moment he reappeared STOP "It's Bruno that's crying: and he's my brother: and, please, we both
want to go: he ca'n't walk, you know: he's--he's dreaming, you know"
(this in a whisper, for fear of hurting my feelings) STOP "Do let's go
through the Ivory Door! STOP "I'll ask him," said the Professor, disappearing again STOP He returned
directly STOP "He says you may STOP Follow me, and walk on tip-toe. STOP The difficulty with me would have been, just then, not to walk on
tip-toe STOP It seemed very hard to reach down far enough to just touch the
floor, as Sylvie led me through the study STOP The Professor went before us to unlock the Ivory Door STOP I had just time
to glance at the Other Professor, who was sitting reading, with his back
to us, before the Professor showed us out through the door, and locked
it behind us STOP Bruno was standing with his hands over his face, crying
bitterly STOP {Image...'What's the matter, darling?' STOP "What's the matter, darling? STOP said Sylvie, with her arms round his neck STOP "Hurted mine self welly much! STOP sobbed the poor little fellow STOP "I'm so sorry, darling STOP How ever did you manage to hurt yourself so? STOP "Course I managed it! STOP said Bruno, laughing through his tears STOP "Doos oo
think nobody else but oo ca'n't manage things? STOP Matters were looking distinctly brighter, now Bruno had begun to argue STOP "Come, let's hear all about it! STOP I said STOP "My foot took it into its head to slip--" Bruno began STOP "A foot hasn't got a head! STOP Sylvie put in, but all in vain STOP "I slipted down the bank STOP And I tripted over a stone STOP And the stone
hurted my foot STOP And I trod on a Bee STOP And the Bee stinged my finger! STOP Poor Bruno sobbed again STOP The complete list of woes was too much for his
feelings STOP "And it knewed I didn't mean to trod on it! STOP he added, as the
climax STOP "That Bee should be ashamed of itself! STOP I said severely, and Sylvie
hugged and kissed the wounded hero till all tears were dried STOP "My finger's quite unstung now! STOP said Bruno STOP "Why doos there be stones STOP Mister Sir, doos oo know? STOP "They're good for something," I said: "even if we don't know what STOP What's the good of dandelions, now? STOP "Dindledums? STOP said Bruno STOP "Oh, they're ever so pretty STOP And stones aren't
pretty, one bit STOP Would oo like some dindledums, Mister Sir? STOP "Bruno! STOP Sylvie murmured reproachfully STOP "You mustn't say 'Mister' and
'Sir,' both at once STOP Remember what I told you! STOP "You telled me I were to say Mister' when I spoked about him, and I were
to say 'Sir' when I spoked to him! STOP "Well, you're not doing both, you know. STOP "Ah, but I is doing bofe, Miss Praticular! STOP Bruno exclaimed
triumphantly STOP "I wishted to speak about the Gemplun--and I wishted to
speak to the Gemplun STOP So a course I said 'Mister Sir'! STOP "That's all right, Bruno," I said STOP "Course it's all right! STOP said Bruno STOP "Sylvie just knows nuffin at all! STOP "There never was an impertinenter boy! STOP said Sylvie, frowning till her
bright eyes were nearly invisible STOP "And there never was an ignoranter girl! STOP retorted Bruno STOP "Come along
and pick some dindledums STOP That's all she's fit for! STOP he added in a very
loud whisper to me STOP "But why do you say 'Dindledums,' Bruno STOP Dandelions is the right word. STOP "It's because he jumps about so," Sylvie said, laughing STOP "Yes, that's it," Bruno assented STOP "Sylvie tells me the words, and then,
when I jump about, they get shooken up in my head--till they're all
froth! STOP I expressed myself as perfectly satisfied with this explanation STOP "But
aren't you going to pick me any dindledums, after all? STOP "Course we will! STOP cried Bruno STOP "Come along, Sylvie! STOP And the happy
children raced away, bounding over the turf with the fleetness and grace
of young antelopes STOP "Then you didn't find your way back to Outland? STOP I said to the
Professor STOP "Oh yes, I did! STOP he replied, "We never got to Queer Street; but I found
another way STOP I've been backwards and forwards several times since then STOP I had to be present at the Election, you know, as the author of the new
Money-act STOP The Emperor was so kind as to wish that I should have the
credit of it STOP 'Let come what come may,' (I remember the very words of
the Imperial Speech) 'if it should turn out that the Warden is alive,
you will bear witness that the change in the coinage is the Professor's
doing, not mine! STOP I never was so glorified in my life, before! STOP Tears
trickled down his cheeks at the recollection, which apparently was not
wholly a pleasant one STOP "Is the Warden supposed to be dead? STOP "Well, it's supposed so: but, mind you, I don't believe it STOP The evidence
is very weak--mere hear-say STOP A wandering Jester, with a Dancing-Bear
(they found their way into the Palace, one day) has been telling people
he comes from Fairyland, and that the Warden died there STOP I wanted the
Vice-Warden to question him, but, most unluckily, he and my Lady
were always out walking when the Jester came round STOP Yes, the Warden's
supposed to be dead! STOP And more tears trickled down the old man's cheeks STOP "But what is the new Money-Act? STOP The Professor brightened up again STOP "The Emperor started the thing," he
said STOP "He wanted to make everybody in Outland twice as rich as he was
before just to make the new Government popular STOP Only there wasn't nearly
enough money in the Treasury to do it STOP So I suggested that he might do
it by doubling the value of every coin and bank-note in Outland STOP It's
the simplest thing possible STOP I wonder nobody ever thought of it before STOP And you never saw such universal joy STOP The shops are full from morning to
night STOP Everybody's buying everything! STOP "And how was the glorifying done? STOP A sudden gloom overcast the Professor's jolly face STOP "They did it as I
went home after the Election," he mournfully replied STOP "It was kindly
meant but I didn't like it STOP They waved flags all round me till I was
nearly blind: and they rang bells till I was nearly deaf: and they
strewed the road so thick with flowers that I lost my way! STOP And the poor
old man sighed deeply STOP "How far is it to Outland? STOP I asked, to change the subject STOP "About five days' march STOP But one must go back--occasionally STOP You see, as
Court-Professor, I have to be always in attendance on Prince Uggug STOP The
Empress would be very angry if I left him, even for an hour. STOP "But surely, every time you come here, you are absent ten days, at
least? STOP "Oh, more than that! STOP the Professor exclaimed STOP "A fortnight, sometimes STOP But of course I keep a memorandum of the exact time when I started, so
that I can put the Court-time back to the very moment! STOP "Excuse me," I
said STOP "I don't understand. STOP Silently the Professor drew front his pocket a square gold watch, with
six or eight hands, and held it out for my inspection STOP "This," he began,
"is an Outlandish Watch--"

"So I should have thought. STOP "--which has the peculiar property that, instead of its going with the
time, the time goes with it STOP I trust you understand me now? STOP "Hardly," I said STOP "Permit me to explain STOP So long as it is let alone, it takes its own
course STOP Time has no effect upon it. STOP "I have known such watches," I remarked STOP "It goes, of course, at the usual rate STOP Only the time has to go with it STOP Hence, if I move the hands, I change the time STOP To move them forwards, in
advance of the true time, is impossible: but I can move them as much as
a month backwards---that is the limit STOP And then you have the events all
over again--with any alterations experience may suggest. STOP "What a blessing such a watch would be," I thought, "in real life STOP To
be able to unsay some heedless word--to undo some reckless deed STOP Might I
see the thing done? STOP "With pleasure! STOP said the good natured Professor STOP "When I move this
hand back to here," pointing out the place, "History goes back fifteen
minutes! STOP Trembling with excitement, I watched him push the hand round as he
described STOP "Hurted mine self welly much! STOP Shrilly and suddenly the words rang in my ears, and, more startled than
I cared to show, I turned to look for the speaker STOP Yes STOP There was Bruno, standing with the tears running down his cheeks,
just as I had seen him a quarter of an hour ago; and there was Sylvie
with her arms round his neck STOP I had not the heart to make the dear little fellow go through his
troubles a second time, so hastily begged the Professor to push the
hands round into their former position STOP In a moment Sylvie and Bruno
were gone again, and I could just see them in the far distance, picking
'dindledums. STOP "Wonderful, indeed! STOP I exclaimed STOP "It has another property, yet more wonderful," said the Professor STOP "You
see this little peg STOP That is called the 'Reversal Peg. STOP If you push it
in, the events of the next hour happen in the reverse order STOP Do not
try it now STOP I will lend you the Watch for a few days, and you can amuse
yourself with experiments. STOP "Thank you very much! STOP I said as he gave me the Watch STOP "I'll take the
greatest care of it--why, here are the children again! STOP "We could only but find six dindledums," said Bruno, putting them into
my hands, "'cause Sylvie said it were time to go back STOP And here's a big
blackberry for ooself STOP We couldn't only find but two! STOP "Thank you: it's very nice," I said STOP "And I suppose you ate the other,
Bruno? STOP "No, I didn't," Bruno said, carelessly STOP "Aren't they pretty dindledums,
Mister Sir? STOP "Yes, very: but what makes you limp so, my child? STOP "Mine foot's come hurted again! STOP Bruno mournfully replied STOP And he sat
down on the ground, and began nursing it STOP The Professor held his head between his hands--an attitude that I knew
indicated distraction of mind STOP "Better rest a minute," he said STOP "It may
be better then--or it may be worse STOP If only I had some of my medicines
here STOP I'm Court-Physician, you know," he added, aside to me STOP "Shall I go and get you some blackberries, darling? STOP Sylvie whispered,
with her arms round his neck; and she kissed away a tear that was
trickling down his cheek STOP Bruno brightened up in a moment STOP "That are a good plan! STOP he
exclaimed STOP "I thinks my foot would come quite unhurted, if I eated a
blackberry--two or three blackberries--six or seven blackberries--"

Sylvie got up hastily STOP "I'd better go," she said, aside to me, "before
he gets into the double figures! STOP "Let me come and help you," I said STOP "I can reach higher up than you
can. STOP "Yes, please," said Sylvie, putting her hand into mine: and we walked
off together STOP "Bruno loves blackberries," she said, as we paced slowly along by a tall
hedge, "that looked a promising place for them, and it was so sweet of
him to make me eat the only one! STOP "Oh, it was you that ate it, then STOP Bruno didn't seem to like to tell me
about it. STOP "No; I saw that," said Sylvie STOP "He's always afraid of being praised STOP But
he made me eat it, really STOP I would much rather he--oh, what's that? STOP And
she clung to my hand, half-frightened, as we came in sight of a hare,
lying on its side with legs stretched out just in the entrance to the
wood STOP "It's a hare, my child STOP Perhaps it's asleep. STOP "No, it isn't asleep," Sylvie said, timidly going nearer to look at it:
"it's eyes are open STOP Is it--is it--her voice dropped to an awestruck
whisper, is it dead, do you think? STOP "Yes, it's quite dead," I said, after stooping to examine it STOP "Poor
thing STOP I think it's been hunted to death STOP I know the harriers were out
yesterday STOP But they haven't touched it STOP Perhaps they caught sight of
another, and left it to die of fright and exhaustion. STOP "Hunted to death? STOP Sylvie repeated to herself, very slowly and sadly STOP "I
thought hunting was a thing they played at like a game STOP Bruno and I hunt
snails: but we never hurt them when we catch them! STOP "Sweet angel! STOP I thought STOP "How am I to get the idea of Sport into your
innocent mind? STOP And as we stood, hand-in-hand, looking down at the dead
hare, I tried to put the thing into such words as she could understand STOP "You know what fierce wild-beasts lions and tigers are? STOP Sylvie nodded STOP "Well, in some countries men have to kill them, to save their own lives,
you know. STOP "Yes," said Sylvie: "if one tried to kill me, Bruno would kill it if he
could. STOP "Well, and so the men--the hunters--get to enjoy it, you know: the
running, and the fighting, and the shouting, and the danger. STOP "Yes," said Sylvie STOP "Bruno likes danger. STOP "Well, but, in this country, there aren't any lions and tigers, loose:
so they hunt other creatures, you see. STOP I hoped, but in vain, that this
would satisfy her, and that she would ask no more questions STOP "They hunt foxes," Sylvie said, thoughtfully STOP "And I think they kill
them, too STOP Foxes are very fierce STOP I daresay men don't love them STOP Are
hares fierce? STOP "No," I said STOP "A hare is a sweet, gentle, timid animal--almost as gentle
as a lamb. STOP "But, if men love hares, why--why--" her voice quivered, and her sweet
eyes were brimming over with tears STOP "I'm afraid they don't love them, dear child. STOP "All children love them," Sylvie said STOP "All ladies love them. STOP "I'm afraid even ladies go to hunt them, sometimes. STOP Sylvie shuddered STOP "Oh, no, not ladies! STOP she earnestly pleaded STOP "Not Lady
Muriel! STOP "No, she never does, I'm sure--but this is too sad a sight for you,
dear STOP Let's try and find some--"

But Sylvie was not satisfied yet STOP In a hushed, solemn tone, with bowed
head and clasped hands, she put her final question STOP "Does GOD love
hares? STOP "Yes! STOP I said STOP "I'm sure He does STOP He loves every living thing STOP Even
sinful men STOP How much more the animals, that cannot sin! STOP "I don't know what 'sin' means," said Sylvie STOP And I didn't try to
explain it STOP "Come, my child," I said, trying to lead her away STOP "Wish good-bye to the
poor hare, and come and look for blackberries. STOP "Good-bye, poor hare! STOP Sylvie obediently repeated, looking over her
shoulder at it as we turned away STOP And then, all in a moment, her
self-command gave way STOP Pulling her hand out of mine, she ran back to
where the dead hare was lying, and flung herself down at its side in
such an agony of grief as I could hardly have believed possible in so
young a child STOP "Oh, my darling, my darling! STOP she moaned, over and over again STOP "And God
meant your life to be so beautiful! STOP Sometimes, but always keeping her face hidden on the ground, she would
reach out one little hand, to stroke the poor dead thing, and then once
more bury her face in her hands, and sob as if her heart would break STOP {Image...The dead hare}

I was afraid she would really make herself ill: still I thought it best
to let her weep away the first sharp agony of grief: and, after a few
minutes, the sobbing gradually ceased, and Sylvie rose to her feet, and
looked calmly at me, though tears were still streaming down her cheeks STOP I did not dare to speak again, just yet; but simply held out my hand to
her, that we might quit the melancholy spot STOP Yes, I'll come now, she said STOP Very reverently she kneeled down, and
kissed the dead hare; then rose and gave me her hand, and we moved on in
silence STOP A child's sorrow is violent but short; and it was almost in her usual
voice that she said after a minute "Oh stop stop STOP Here are some lovely
blackberries! STOP We filled our hands with fruit and returned in all haste to where the
Professor and Bruno were seated on a bank awaiting our return STOP Just before we came within hearing-distance Sylvie checked me STOP "Please
don't tell Bruno about the hare! STOP she said STOP Very well, my child STOP But why not STOP Tears again glittered in those sweet eyes and she turned her head away
so that I could scarcely hear her reply STOP "He's--he's very fond of gentle
creatures you know STOP And he'd--he'd be so sorry STOP I don't want him to be
made sorry. STOP And your agony of sorrow is to count for nothing, then, sweet unselfish
child STOP I thought to myself STOP But no more was said till we had reached
our friends; and Bruno was far too much engrossed, in the feast we had
brought him, to take any notice of Sylvie's unusually grave manner STOP "I'm afraid it's getting rather late, Professor? STOP I said STOP "Yes, indeed," said the Professor STOP "I must take you all through the
Ivory Door again STOP You've stayed your full time. STOP "Mightn't we stay a little longer! STOP pleaded Sylvie STOP "Just one minute! STOP added Bruno STOP But the Professor was unyielding STOP "It's a great privilege, coming
through at all," he said STOP "We must go now. STOP And we followed him
obediently to the Ivory Door, which he threw open, and signed to me to
go through first STOP "You're coming too, aren't you? STOP I said to Sylvie STOP "Yes," she said: "but you won't see us after you've gone through. STOP "But suppose I wait for you outside? STOP I asked, as I stepped through the
doorway STOP "In that case," said Sylvie, "I think the potato would be quite
justified in asking your weight STOP I can quite imagine a really superior
kidney-potato declining to argue with any one under fifteen stone! STOP With a great effort I recovered the thread of my thoughts STOP "We lapse
very quickly into nonsense! STOP I said STOP  STOP CROSSING THE LINE STOP "Let us lapse back again," said Lady Muriel STOP "Take another cup of tea STOP I
hope that's sound common sense? STOP "And all that strange adventure," I thought, "has occupied the space
of a single comma in Lady Muriel's speech STOP A single comma, for which
grammarians tell us to 'count one'! STOP (I felt no doubt that the Professor
had kindly put back the time for me, to the exact point at which I had
gone to sleep. STOP When, a few minutes afterwards, we left the house, Arthur's first remark
was certainly a strange one STOP "We've been there just twenty minutes," he
said, "and I've done nothing but listen to you and Lady Muriel talking:
and yet, somehow, I feel exactly as if I had been talking with her for
an hour at least! STOP And so he had been, I felt no doubt: only, as the time had been put back
to the beginning of the tete-a-tete he referred to, the whole of it
had passed into oblivion, if not into nothingness STOP But I valued my own
reputation for sanity too highly to venture on explaining to him what
had happened STOP For some cause, which I could not at the moment divine, Arthur was
unusually grave and silent during our walk home STOP It could not be
connected with Eric Lindon, I thought, as he had for some days been away
in London: so that, having Lady Muriel almost 'all to himself'--for
I was only too glad to hear those two conversing, to have any wish to
intrude any remarks of my own--he ought, theoretically, to have been
specially radiant and contented with life STOP "Can he have heard any bad
news? STOP I said to myself STOP And, almost as if he had read my thoughts, he
spoke STOP "He will be here by the last train," he said, in the tone of one who is
continuing a conversation rather than beginning one STOP "Captain Lindon, do you mean? STOP "Yes--Captain Lindon," said Arthur: "I said 'he,' because I fancied
we were talking about him STOP The Earl told me he comes tonight, though
to-morrow is the day when he will know about the Commission that he's
hoping for STOP I wonder he doesn't stay another day to hear the result, if
he's really so anxious about it as the Earl believes he is. STOP "He can have a telegram sent after him," I said: "but it's not very
soldier-like, running away from possible bad news! STOP "He's a very good fellow," said Arthur: "but I confess it would be good
news for me, if he got his Commission, and his Marching Orders, all at
once STOP I wish him all happiness--with one exception STOP Good night! STOP (We had
reached home by this time. STOP "I'm not good company to-night--better be
alone. STOP It was much the same, next day STOP Arthur declared he wasn't fit for
Society, and I had to set forth alone for an afternoon-stroll STOP I took
the road to the Station, and, at the point where the road from the
'Hall' joined it, I paused, seeing my friends in the distance, seemingly
bound for the same goal STOP "Will you join us? STOP the Earl said, after I had exchanged greetings with
him, and Lady Muriel, and Captain Lindon STOP "This restless young man is
expecting a telegram, and we are going to the Station to meet it. STOP "There is also a restless young woman in the case," Lady Muriel added STOP "That goes without saying, my child," said her father STOP "Women are always
restless! STOP "For generous appreciation of all one's best qualities," his daughter
impressively remarked, "there's nothing to compare with a father, is
there, Eric? STOP "Cousins are not 'in it,'" said Eric: and then somehow the conversation
lapsed into two duologues, the younger folk taking the lead, and the two
old men following with less eager steps STOP "And when are we to see your little friends again? STOP said the Earl STOP "They
are singularly attractive children. STOP "I shall be delighted to bring them, when I can," I said STOP "But I don't
know, myself, when I am likely to see them again. STOP "I'm not going to question you," said the Earl: "but there's no harm in
mentioning that Muriel is simply tormented with curiosity STOP We know most
of the people about here, and she has been vainly trying to guess what
house they can possibly be staying at. STOP "Some day I may be able to enlighten her: but just at present--"

"Thanks STOP She must bear it as best she can STOP I tell her it's a grand
opportunity for practising patience STOP But she hardly sees it from that
point of view STOP Why, there are the children! STOP So indeed they were: waiting (for us, apparently) at a stile, which they
could not have climbed over more than a few moments, as Lady Muriel and
her cousin had passed it without seeing them STOP On catching sight of us,
Bruno ran to meet us, and to exhibit to us, with much pride, the handle
of a clasp-knife--the blade having been broken off--which he had picked
up in the road STOP "And what shall you use it for, Bruno? STOP I said STOP "Don't know," Bruno carelessly replied: "must think. STOP "A child's first view of life," the Earl remarked, with that sweet
sad smile of his, "is that it is a period to be spent in accumulating
portable property STOP That view gets modified as the years glide away. STOP And
he held out his hand to Sylvie, who had placed herself by me, looking a
little shy of him STOP But the gentle old man was not one with whom any child, human or fairy,
could be shy for long; and she had very soon deserted my hand for
his--Bruno alone remaining faithful to his first friend STOP We overtook the
other couple just as they reached the Station, and both Lady Muriel and
Eric greeted the children as old friends--the latter with the words "So
you got to Babylon by candlelight, after all? STOP "Yes, and back again! STOP cried Bruno STOP Lady Muriel looked from one to the other in blank astonishment STOP "What,
you know them, Eric? STOP she exclaimed STOP "This mystery grows deeper every
day! STOP "Then we must be somewhere in the Third Act," said Eric STOP "You don't
expect the mystery to be cleared up till the Fifth Act, do you? STOP "But it's such a long drama! STOP was the plaintive reply STOP "We must have got
to the Fifth Act by this time! STOP "Third Act, I assure you," said the young soldier mercilessly STOP "Scene, a
railway-platform STOP Lights down STOP Enter Prince (in disguise, of course)
and faithful Attendant STOP This is the Prince--" (taking Bruno's hand)
"and here stands his humble Servant STOP What is your Royal Highness next
command? STOP And he made a most courtier-like low bow to his puzzled little
friend STOP "Oo're not a Servant! STOP Bruno scornfully exclaimed STOP "Oo're a Gemplun! STOP "Servant, I assure your Royal Highness! STOP Eric respectfully insisted STOP "Allow me to mention to your Royal Highness my various situations--past,
present, and future. STOP "What did oo begin wiz? STOP Bruno asked, beginning to enter into the jest STOP "Was oo a shoe-black? STOP "Lower than that, your Royal Highness STOP Years ago, I offered myself as
a Slave--as a 'Confidential Slave,' I think it's called? STOP he asked,
turning to Lady Muriel STOP But Lady Muriel heard him not: something had gone wrong with her glove,
which entirely engrossed her attention STOP "Did oo get the place? STOP said Bruno STOP "Sad to say, Your Royal Highness, I did not STOP So I had to take a
situation as--as Waiter, which I have now held for some years haven't
I? STOP He again glanced at Lady Muriel STOP "Sylvie dear, do help me to button this glove! STOP Lady Muriel whispered,
hastily stooping down, and failing to hear the question STOP "And what will oo be next? STOP said Bruno STOP "My next place will, I hope, be that of Groom STOP And after that--"

"Don't puzzle the child so! STOP Lady Muriel interrupted STOP "What nonsense you
talk! STOP "--after that," Eric persisted, "I hope to obtain the situation of
Housekeeper, which--Fourth Act! STOP he proclaimed, with a sudden change of
tone STOP "Lights turned up STOP Red lights STOP Green lights STOP Distant rumble heard STOP Enter a passenger-train! STOP And in another minute the train drew up alongside of the platform, and
a stream of passengers began to flow out from the booking office and
waiting-rooms STOP "Did you ever make real life into a drama? STOP said the Earl STOP "Now just
try STOP I've often amused myself that way STOP Consider this platform as
our stage STOP Good entrances and exits on both sides, you see STOP Capital
background scene: real engine moving up and down STOP All this bustle, and
people passing to and fro, must have been most carefully rehearsed STOP How
naturally they do it STOP With never a glance at the audience STOP And every
grouping is quite fresh, you see STOP No repetition! STOP It really was admirable, as soon as I began to enter into it from this
point of view STOP Even a porter passing, with a barrow piled with luggage,
seemed so realistic that one was tempted to applaud STOP He was followed
by an angry mother, with hot red face, dragging along two screaming
children, and calling, to some one behind, "John STOP Come on! STOP Enter John,
very meek, very silent, and loaded with parcels STOP And he was followed,
in his turn, by a frightened little nursemaid, carrying a fat baby, also
screaming STOP All the children screamed STOP "Capital byplay! STOP said the old man aside STOP "Did you notice the
nursemaid's look of terror STOP It was simply perfect! STOP "You have struck quite a new vein," I said STOP "To most of us Life and its
pleasures seem like a mine that is nearly worked out. STOP "Worked out! STOP exclaimed the Earl STOP "For any one with true dramatic
instincts, it is only the Overture that is ended STOP The real treat has yet
to begin STOP You go to a theatre, and pay your ten shillings for a stall,
and what do you get for your money STOP Perhaps it's a dialogue between a
couple of farmers--unnatural in their overdone caricature of farmers'
dress--more unnatural in their constrained attitudes and gestures--most
unnatural in their attempts at ease and geniality in their talk STOP Go
instead and take a seat in a third-class railway-carriage, and you'll
get the same dialogue done to the life STOP Front-seats--no orchestra to
block the view--and nothing to pay! STOP "Which reminds me," said Eric STOP "There is nothing to pay on receiving a
telegram STOP Shall we enquire for one? STOP And he and Lady Muriel strolled off
in the direction of the Telegraph-Office STOP "I wonder if Shakespeare had that thought in his mind," I said, "when he
wrote 'All the world's a stage'? STOP The old man sighed STOP "And so it is," he said, "look at it as you will STOP Life is indeed a drama; a drama with but few encores--and no bouquets! STOP he added dreamily STOP "We spend one half of it in regretting the things we
did in the other half! STOP "And the secret of enjoying it," he continued, resuming his cheerful
tone, "is intensity! STOP "But not in the modern aesthetic sense, I presume STOP Like the young lady,
in Punch, who begins a conversation with 'Are you intense?' STOP "By no means! STOP replied the Earl STOP "What I mean is intensity of thought--a
concentrated attention STOP We lose half the pleasure we might have in Life,
by not really attending STOP Take any instance you like: it doesn't matter
how trivial the pleasure may be--the principle is the same STOP Suppose
A and B are reading the same second-rate circulating-library novel STOP A
never troubles himself to master the relationships of the characters, on
which perhaps all the interest of the story depends: he 'skips' over all
the descriptions of scenery, and every passage that looks rather dull:
he doesn't half attend to the passages he does read: he goes on reading
merely from want of resolution to find another occupation--for hours
after he ought to have put the book aside: and reaches the 'FINIS' in a
state of utter weariness and depression STOP B puts his whole soul into the
thing--on the principle that 'whatever is worth doing is worth doing
well': he masters the genealogies: he calls up pictures before his
'mind's eye' as he reads about the scenery: best of all, he resolutely
shuts the book at the end of some chapter, while his interest is yet at
its keenest, and turns to other subjects; so that, when next he allows
himself an hour at it, it is like a hungry man sitting down to dinner:
and, when the book is finished, he returns to the work of his daily life
like 'a giant refreshed'! STOP "But suppose the book were really rubbish--nothing to repay attention? STOP "Well, suppose it," said the Earl STOP "My theory meets that case, I assure
you STOP A never finds out that it is rubbish, but maunders on to the end,
trying to believe he's enjoying himself STOP B quietly shuts the book, when
he's read a dozen pages, walks off to the Library, and changes it for
a better STOP I have yet another theory for adding to the enjoyment of
Life--that is, if I have not exhausted your patience STOP I'm afraid you
find me a very garrulous old man. STOP "No indeed! STOP I exclaimed earnestly STOP And indeed I felt as if one could
not easily tire of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice STOP "It is, that we should learn to take our pleasures quickly, and our
pains slowly. STOP "But why STOP I should have put it the other way, myself. STOP "By taking artificial pain--which can be as trivial as you
please--slowly, the result is that, when real pain comes, however
severe, all you need do is to let it go at its ordinary pace, and it's
over in a moment! STOP "Very true," I said, "but how about the pleasure? STOP "Why, by taking it quick, you can get so much more into life STOP It takes
you three hours and a half to hear and enjoy an opera STOP Suppose I can
take it in, and enjoy it, in half-an-hour STOP Why, I can enjoy seven
operas, while you are listening; to one! STOP "Always supposing you have an orchestra capable of playing them," I
said STOP "And that orchestra has yet to be found! STOP The old man smiled STOP "I have heard an 'air played," he said, "and by no
means a short one--played right through, variations and all, in three
seconds! STOP "When STOP And how? STOP I asked eagerly, with a half-notion that I was dreaming
again STOP "It was done by a little musical-box," he quietly replied STOP "After it had
been wound up, the regulator, or something, broke, and it ran down, as I
said, in about three seconds STOP But it must have played all the notes, you
know! STOP "Did you enjoy it STOP I asked, with all the severity of a cross-examining
barrister STOP "No, I didn't! STOP he candidly confessed STOP "But then, you know, I hadn't
been trained to that kind of music! STOP "I should much like to try your plan," I said, and, as Sylvie and Bruno
happened to run up to us at the moment, I left them to keep the Earl
company, and strolled along the platform, making each person and event
play its part in an extempore drama for my especial benefit STOP "What, is
the Earl tired of you already? STOP I said, as the children ran past me STOP "No! STOP Sylvie replied with great emphasis STOP "He wants the evening-paper STOP So Bruno's going to be a little news-boy! STOP "Mind you charge a good price for it! STOP I called after them STOP Returning up the platform, I came upon Sylvie alone STOP "Well, child,"
I said, "where's your little news-boy STOP Couldn't he get you an
evening-paper? STOP "He went to get one at the book-stall at the other side," said Sylvie;
"and he's coming across the line with it--oh, Bruno, you ought to cross
by the bridge! STOP for the distant thud, thud, of the Express was already
audible STOP Suddenly a look of horror came over her face STOP "Oh, he's fallen down on
the rails! STOP she cried, and darted past me at a speed that quite defied
the hasty effort I made to stop her STOP But the wheezy old Station-Master happened to be close behind me: he
wasn't good for much, poor old man, but he was good for this; and,
before I could turn round, he had the child clasped in his arms, saved
from the certain death she was rushing to STOP So intent was I in watching
this scene, that I hardly saw a flying figure in a light grey suit,
who shot across from the back of the platform, and was on the line in
another second STOP So far as one could take note of time in such a moment
of horror, he had about ten clear seconds, before the Express would be
upon him, in which to cross the rails and to pick up Bruno STOP Whether he
did so or not it was quite impossible to guess: the next thing one knew
was that the Express had passed, and that, whether for life or death,
all was over STOP When the cloud of dust had cleared away, and the line was
once more visible, we saw with thankful hearts that the child and his
deliverer were safe STOP "All right! STOP Eric called to us cheerfully, as he recrossed the line STOP "He's more frightened than hurt! STOP {Image...Crossing the line}

He lifted the little fellow up into Lady Muriel's arms, and mounted
the platform as gaily as if nothing had happened: but he was as pale as
death, and leaned heavily on the arm I hastily offered him, fearing he
was about to faint STOP "I'll just--sit down a moment--" he said dreamily:
"--where's Sylvie? STOP Sylvie ran to him, and flung her arms round his neck, sobbing as if her
heart would break STOP "Don't do that, my darling! STOP Eric murmured, with a
strange look in his eyes STOP "Nothing to cry about now, you know STOP But you
very nearly got yourself killed for nothing! STOP "For Bruno! STOP the little maiden sobbed STOP "And he would have done it for
me STOP Wouldn't you, Bruno? STOP "Course I would! STOP Bruno said, looking round with a bewildered air STOP Lady Muriel kissed him in silence as she put him down out of her arms STOP Then she beckoned Sylvie to come and take his hand, and signed to
the children to go back to where the Earl was seated STOP "Tell him," she
whispered with quivering lips, "tell him--all is well! STOP Then she turned
to the hero of the day STOP "I thought it was death," she said STOP "Thank God,
you are safe STOP Did you see how near it was? STOP "I saw there was just time," Eric said lightly STOP "A soldier must learn to carry his life in his hand, you know STOP I'm all
right now STOP Shall we go to the telegraph-office again STOP I daresay it's
come by this time. STOP I went to join the Earl and the children, and we waited--almost in
silence, for no one seemed inclined to talk, and Bruno was half-asleep
on Sylvie's lap--till the others joined us STOP No telegram had come STOP "I'll take a stroll with the children," I said, feeling that we were a
little de trop, "and I'll look in, in the course of the evening. STOP "We must go back into the wood, now," Sylvie said, as soon as we were
out of hearing STOP "We ca'n't stay this size any longer. STOP "Then you will be quite tiny Fairies again, next time we meet? STOP "Yes," said Sylvie: "but we'll be children again some day--if you'll let
us STOP Bruno's very anxious to see Lady Muriel again. STOP "She are welly nice," said Bruno STOP "I shall be very glad to take you to see her again," I said STOP "Hadn't I
better give you back the Professor's Watch STOP It'll be too large for you
to carry when you're Fairies, you know. STOP Bruno laughed merrily STOP I was glad to see he had quite recovered from the
terrible scene he had gone through STOP "Oh no, it won't! STOP he said STOP "When we
go small, it'll go small! STOP "And then it'll go straight to the Professor," Sylvie added, "and you
won't be able to use it anymore: so you'd better use it all you can,
now STOP We must go small when the sun sets STOP Good-bye! STOP "Good-bye! STOP cried Bruno STOP But their voices sounded very far away, and,
when I looked round, both children had disappeared STOP "And it wants only two hours to sunset! STOP I said as I strolled on STOP "I
must make the best of my time! STOP  STOP AN OUTLANDISH WATCH STOP As I entered the little town, I came upon two of the fishermen's wives
interchanging that last word "which never was the last": and it occurred
to me, as an experiment with the Magic Watch, to wait till the little
scene was over, and then to 'encore' it STOP "Well, good night t'ye STOP And ye winna forget to send us word when your
Martha writes? STOP "Nay, ah winna forget STOP An' if she isn't suited, she can but coom back STOP Good night t'ye! STOP A casual observer might have thought "and there ends the dialogue! STOP That
casual observer would have been mistaken STOP "Ah, she'll like 'em, I war'n' ye STOP They'll not treat her bad, yer may
depend STOP They're varry canny fowk STOP Good night! STOP "Ay, they are that STOP Good night! STOP "Good night STOP And ye'll send us word if she writes? STOP "Aye, ah will, yer may depend STOP Good night t'ye! STOP And at last they parted STOP I waited till they were some twenty yards
apart, and then put the Watch a minute back STOP The instantaneous change
was startling: the two figures seemed to flash back into their former
places.

 STOP --isn't suited, she can but coom back STOP Good night t'ye! STOP one of them
was saying: and so the whole dialogue was repeated, and, when they
had parted for the second time, I let them go their several ways, and
strolled on through the town STOP "But the real usefulness of this magic power," I thought, "would be to
undo some harm, some painful event, some accident--"

I had not long to wait for an opportunity of testing this property also
of the Magic Watch, for, even as the thought passed through my mind, the
accident I was imagining occurred STOP A light cart was standing at the
door of the 'Great Millinery Depot' of Elveston, laden with card-board
packing-cases, which the driver was carrying into the shop, one by one STOP One of the cases had fallen into the street, but it scarcely seemed
worth while to step forward and pick it up, as the man would be back
again in a moment STOP Yet, in that moment, a young man riding a bicycle
came sharp round the corner of the street and, in trying to avoid
running over the box, upset his machine, and was thrown headlong against
the wheel of the spring-cart STOP The driver ran out to his assistance, and
he and I together raised the unfortunate cyclist and carried him into
the shop STOP His head was cut and bleeding; and one knee seemed to be badly
injured; and it was speedily settled that he had better be conveyed at
once to the only Surgery in the place STOP I helped them in emptying the
cart, and placing in it some pillows for the wounded man to rest on; and
it was only when the driver had mounted to his place, and was starting
for the Surgery, that I bethought me of the strange power I possessed of
undoing all this harm STOP "Now is my time! STOP I said to myself, as I moved back the hand of the
Watch, and saw, almost without surprise this time, all things restored
to the places they had occupied at the critical moment when I had first
noticed the fallen packing-case STOP Instantly I stepped out into the street, picked up the box, and replaced
it in the cart: in the next moment the bicycle had spun round the
corner, passed the cart without let or hindrance, and soon vanished in
the distance, in a cloud of dust STOP "Delightful power of magic! STOP I thought STOP "How much of human suffering I
have--not only relieved, but actually annihilated! STOP And, in a glow of
conscious virtue, I stood watching the unloading of the cart, still
holding the Magic Watch open in my hand, as I was curious to see what
would happen when we again reached the exact time at which I had put
back the hand STOP The result was one that, if only I had considered the thing carefully,
I might have foreseen: as the hand of the Watch touched the mark, the
spring-cart--which had driven off, and was by this time half-way down
the street, was back again at the door, and in the act of starting,
while--oh woe for the golden dream of world-wide benevolence that had
dazzled my dreaming fancy!--the wounded youth was once more reclining
on the heap of pillows, his pale face set rigidly in the hard lines that
told of pain resolutely endured STOP "Oh mocking Magic Watch! STOP I said to myself, as I passed out of the
little town, and took the seaward road that led to my lodgings STOP "The
good I fancied I could do is vanished like a dream: the evil of this
troublesome world is the only abiding reality! STOP And now I must record an experience so strange, that I think it only
fair, before beginning to relate it, to release my much-enduring reader
from any obligation he may feel to believe this part of my story STOP I
would not have believed it, I freely confess, if I had not seen it
with my own eyes: then why should I expect it of my reader, who, quite
possibly, has never seen anything of the sort STOP I was passing a pretty little villa, which stood rather back from the
road, in its own grounds, with bright flower-beds in front---creepers
wandering over the walls and hanging in festoons about the
bow-windows--an easy-chair forgotten on the lawn, with a newspaper lying
near it--a small pug-dog "couchant" before it, resolved to guard the
treasure even at the sacrifice of life--and a front-door standing
invitingly half-open STOP "Here is my chance," I thought, "for testing the
reverse action of the Magic Watch! STOP I pressed the 'reversal-peg' and
walked in STOP In another house, the entrance of a stranger might cause
surprise--perhaps anger, even going so far as to expel the said stranger
with violence: but here, I knew, nothing of the sort could happen STOP The ordinary course of events first, to think nothing about me; then,
hearing my footsteps to look up and see me; and then to wonder what
business I had there--would be reversed by the action of my Watch STOP They
would first wonder who I was, then see me, then look down, and think no
more about me STOP And as to being expelled with violence, that event would
necessarily come first in this case STOP "So, if I can once get in," I said
to myself, "all risk of expulsion will be over! STOP {Image...'The pug-dog sat up'}

The pug-dog sat up, as a precautionary measure, as I passed; but, as I
took no notice of the treasure he was guarding, he let me go by without
even one remonstrant bark STOP "He that takes my life," he seemed to be
saying, wheezily, to himself, "takes trash: But he that takes the Daily
Telegraph--! STOP But this awful contingency I did not face STOP The party in the drawing-room--I had walked straight in, you understand,
without ringing the bell, or giving any notice of my approach--consisted
of four laughing rosy children, of ages from about fourteen down to ten,
who were, apparently, all coming towards the door (I found they were
really walking backwards), while their mother, seated by the fire with
some needlework on her lap, was saying, just as I entered the room,
"Now, girls, you may get your things on for a walk. STOP To my utter astonishment--for I was not yet accustomed to the action
of the Watch "all smiles ceased," (as Browning says) on the four pretty
faces, and they all got out pieces of needle-work, and sat down STOP No one
noticed me in the least, as I quietly took a chair and sat down to watch
them STOP When the needle-work had been unfolded, and they were all ready to
begin, their mother said "Come, that's done, at last STOP You may fold
up your work, girls. STOP But the children took no notice whatever of the
remark; on the contrary, they set to work at once sewing--if that is
the proper word to describe an operation such as I had never before
witnessed STOP Each of them threaded her needle with a short end of thread
attached to the work, which was instantly pulled by an invisible force
through the stuff, dragging the needle after it: the nimble fingers of
the little sempstress caught it at the other side, but only to lose it
again the next moment STOP And so the work went on, steadily undoing itself,
and the neatly-stitched little dresses, or whatever they were, steadily
falling to pieces STOP Now and then one of the children would pause, as the
recovered thread became inconveniently long, wind it on a bobbin, and
start again with another short end STOP At last all the work was picked to pieces and put away, and the lady
led the way into the next room, walking backwards, and making the insane
remark "Not yet, dear: we must get the sewing done first. STOP After which,
I was not surprised to see the children skipping backwards after her,
exclaiming "Oh, mother, it is such a lovely day for a walk! STOP In the dining-room, the table had only dirty plates and empty dishes
on it STOP However the party--with the addition of a gentleman, as
good-natured, and as rosy, as the children--seated themselves at it very
contentedly STOP You have seen people eating cherry-tart, and every now and then
cautiously conveying a cherry-stone from their lips to their plates STOP Well, something like that went on all through this ghastly--or shall we
say 'ghostly'?---banquet STOP An empty fork is raised to the lips: there
it receives a neatly-cut piece of mutton, and swiftly conveys it to the
plate, where it instantly attaches itself to the mutton already there STOP Soon one of the plates, furnished with a complete slice of mutton and
two potatoes, was handed up to the presiding gentleman, who quietly
replaced the slice on the joint, and the potatoes in the dish STOP Their conversation was, if possible, more bewildering than their mode of
dining STOP It began by the youngest girl suddenly, and without provocation,
addressing her eldest sister STOP "Oh, you wicked story-teller! STOP she said STOP I expected a sharp reply from the sister; but, instead of this, she
turned laughingly to her father, and said, in a very loud stage-whisper,
"To be a bride! STOP The father, in order to do his part in a conversation that seemed only
fit for lunatics, replied "Whisper it to me, dear. STOP But she didn't whisper (these children never did anything they were
told): she said, quite loud, "Of course not STOP Everybody knows what Dotty
wants! STOP And little Dolly shrugged her shoulders, and said, with a pretty
pettishness, "Now, Father, you're not to tease STOP You know I don't want to
be bride's-maid to anybody! STOP "And Dolly's to be the fourth," was her father's idiotic reply STOP Here Number Three put in her oar STOP "Oh, it is settled, Mother dear,
really and truly STOP Mary told us all about it STOP It's to be next
Tuesday four weeks--and three of her cousins are coming; to be
bride's-maids--and--"

"She doesn't forget it, Minnie! STOP the Mother laughingly replied STOP "I do
wish they'd get it settled STOP I don't like long engagements. STOP And Minnie wound up the conversation--if so chaotic a series of remarks
deserves the name--with "Only think STOP We passed the Cedars this morning,
just exactly as Mary Davenant was standing at the gate, wishing good-bye
to Mister---I forget his name STOP Of course we looked the other way. STOP By this time I was so hopelessly confused that I gave up listening, and
followed the dinner down into the kitchen STOP But to you, O hypercritical reader, resolute to believe no item of this
weird adventure, what need to tell how the mutton was placed on the
spit, and slowly unroasted--how the potatoes were wrapped in their
skins, and handed over to the gardener to be buried--how, when the
mutton had at length attained to rawness, the fire, which had gradually
changed from red-heat to a mere blaze, died down so suddenly that
the cook had only just time to catch its last flicker on the end of a
match--or how the maid, having taken the mutton off the spit, carried
it (backwards, of course) out of the house, to meet the butcher, who was
coming (also backwards) down the road STOP The longer I thought over this strange adventure, the more hopelessly
tangled the mystery became: and it was a real relief to meet Arthur in
the road, and get him to go with me up to the Hall, to learn what news
the telegraph had brought STOP I told him, as we went, what had happened at
the Station, but as to my further adventures I thought it best, for the
present, to say nothing STOP The Earl was sitting alone when we entered STOP "I am glad you are come in
to keep me company," he said STOP "Muriel is gone to bed--the excitement of
that terrible scene was too much for her--and Eric has gone to the hotel
to pack his things, to start for London by the early train. STOP "Then the telegram has come? STOP I said STOP "Did you not hear STOP Oh, I had forgotten: it came in after you left the
Station STOP Yes, it's all right: Eric has got his commission; and, now that
he has arranged matters with Muriel, he has business in town that must
be seen to at once. STOP "What arrangement do you mean? STOP I asked with a sinking heart, as the
thought of Arthur's crushed hopes came to my mind STOP "Do you mean that
they are engaged? STOP "They have been engaged--in a sense--for two years," the old man gently
replied: "that is, he has had my promise to consent to it, so soon as
he could secure a permanent and settled line in life STOP I could never
be happy with my child married to a man without an object to live
for--without even an object to die for! STOP "I hope they will be happy," a strange voice said STOP The speaker was
evidently in the room, but I had not heard the door open, and I looked
round in some astonishment STOP The Earl seemed to share my surprise STOP "Who
spoke? STOP he exclaimed STOP "It was I," said Arthur, looking at us with a worn, haggard face, and
eyes from which the light of life seemed suddenly to have faded STOP "And
let me wish you joy also, dear friend," he added, looking sadly at the
Earl, and speaking in the same hollow tones that had startled us so
much STOP "Thank you," the old man said, simply and heartily STOP A silence followed: then I rose, feeling sure that Arthur would wish to
be alone, and bade our gentle host 'Good night': Arthur took his hand,
but said nothing: nor did he speak again, as we went home till we were
in the house and had lit our bed-room candles STOP Then he said more to
himself than to me, "The heart knoweth its own bitterness STOP I never
understood those words till now. STOP The next few days passed wearily enough STOP I felt no inclination to call
by myself at the Hall; still less to propose that Arthur should go
with me: it seemed better to wait till Time--that gentle healer of our
bitterest sorrows should have helped him to recover from the first shock
of the disappointment that had blighted his life STOP Business however soon demanded my presence in town; and I had to
announce to Arthur that I must leave him for a while STOP "But I hope to run
down again in a month," I added STOP "I would stay now, if I could STOP I don't
think it's good for you to be alone. STOP "No, I ca'n't face solitude, here, for long," said Arthur STOP "But don't
think about me STOP I have made up my mind to accept a post in India, that
has been offered me STOP Out there, I suppose I shall find something to live
for; I ca'n't see anything at present STOP 'This life of mine I guard, as
God's high gift, from scathe and wrong, Not greatly care to lose!' STOP "Yes," I said: "your name-sake bore as heavy a blow, and lived through
it. STOP "A far heavier one than mine," said Arthur STOP "The woman he loved proved
false STOP There is no such cloud as that on my memory of--of--" He left the
name unuttered, and went on hurriedly STOP "But you will return, will you
not? STOP "Yes, I shall come back for a short time. STOP "Do," said Arthur: "and you shall write and tell me of our friends STOP I'll
send you my address when I'm settled down. STOP  STOP THE FROGS' BIRTHDAY-TREAT STOP And so it came to pass that, just a week after the day when my
Fairy-friends first appeared as Children, I found myself taking a
farewell-stroll through the wood, in the hope of meeting them once more STOP I had but to stretch myself on the smooth turf, and the 'eerie' feeling
was on me in a moment STOP "Put oor ear welly low down," said Bruno, "and I'll tell oo a secret STOP It's the Frogs' Birthday-Treat--and we've lost the Baby! STOP "What Baby? STOP I said, quite bewildered by this complicated piece of news STOP "The Queen's Baby, a course! STOP said Bruno STOP "Titania's Baby STOP And we's
welly sorry STOP Sylvie, she's--oh so sorry! STOP "How sorry is she? STOP I asked, mischievously STOP "Three-quarters of a yard," Bruno replied with perfect solemnity STOP "And
I'm a little sorry too," he added, shutting his eyes so as not to see
that he was smiling STOP "And what are you doing about the Baby? STOP "Well, the soldiers are all looking for it--up and down everywhere. STOP "The soldiers? STOP I exclaimed STOP "Yes, a course! STOP said Bruno STOP "When there's no fighting to be done, the
soldiers doos any little odd jobs, oo know. STOP I was amused at the idea of its being a 'little odd job' to find the
Royal Baby STOP "But how did you come to lose it? STOP I asked STOP "We put it in a flower," Sylvie, who had just joined us, explained with
her eyes full of tears STOP "Only we ca'n't remember which! STOP "She says us put it in a flower," Bruno interrupted, "'cause she doosn't
want I to get punished STOP But it were really me what put it there STOP Sylvie
were picking Dindledums. STOP {Image...The queen's baby}

"You shouldn't say 'us put it in a flower'," Sylvie very gravely
remarked STOP "Well, hus, then," said Bruno STOP "I never can remember those horrid H's! STOP "Let me help you to look for it," I said STOP So Sylvie and I made a 'voyage
of discovery' among all the flowers; but there was no Baby to be seen STOP "What's become of Bruno? STOP I said, when we had completed our tour STOP "He's down in the ditch there," said Sylvie, "amusing a young Frog. STOP I went down on my hands and knees to look for him, for I felt very
curious to know how young Frogs ought to be amused STOP After a minute's
search, I found him sitting at the edge of the ditch, by the side of the
little Frog, and looking rather disconsolate STOP "How are you getting on, Bruno? STOP I said, nodding to him as he looked up STOP "Ca'n't amuse it no more," Bruno answered, very dolefully, "'cause
it won't say what it would like to do next STOP I've showed it all
the duck-weeds--and a live caddis-worm----but it won't say nuffin STOP What--would oo like?' STOP he shouted into the ear of the Frog: but the
little creature sat quite still, and took no notice of him STOP "It's deaf,
I think! STOP Bruno said, turning away with a sigh STOP "And it's time to get
the Theatre ready. STOP "Who are the audience to be? STOP "Only but Frogs," said Bruno STOP "But they haven't comed yet STOP They wants to
be drove up, like sheep. STOP "Would it save time," I suggested, "if I were to walk round with Sylvie,
to drive up the Frogs, while you get the Theatre ready? STOP "That are a good plan! STOP cried Bruno STOP "But where are Sylvie? STOP "I'm here! STOP said Sylvie, peeping over the edge of the bank STOP "I was just
watching two Frogs that were having a race. STOP "Which won it? STOP Bruno eagerly inquired STOP Sylvie was puzzled STOP "He does ask such hard questions! STOP she confided to
me STOP "And what's to happen in the Theatre? STOP I asked STOP "First they have their Birthday-Feast," Sylvie said: "then Bruno does
some Bits of Shakespeare; then he tells them a Story. STOP "I should think the Frogs like the Feast best STOP Don't they? STOP "Well, there's generally very few of them that get any STOP They will keep
their mouths shut so tight STOP And it's just as well they do," she added,
"because Bruno likes to cook it himself: and he cooks very queerly STOP Now
they're all in STOP Would you just help me to put them with their heads the
right way? STOP We soon managed this part of the business, though the Frogs kept up a
most discontented croaking all the time STOP "What are they saying? STOP I asked Sylvie STOP "They're saying 'Fork STOP Fork! STOP It's very silly of them STOP You're not going
to have forks! STOP she announced with some severity STOP "Those that want any
Feast have just got to open their mouths, and Bruno 'll put some of it
in! STOP At this moment Bruno appeared, wearing a little white apron to show that
he was a Cook, and carrying a tureen full of very queer-looking soup STOP I watched very carefully as he moved about among the Frogs; but I could
not see that any of them opened their mouths to be fed--except one
very young one, and I'm nearly sure it did it accidentally, in yawning STOP However Bruno instantly put a large spoonful of soup into its mouth, and
the poor little thing coughed violently for some time STOP So Sylvie and I had to share the soup between us, and to pretend to
enjoy it, for it certainly was very queerly cooked STOP I only ventured to take one spoonful of it ("Sylvie's Summer-Soup,"
Bruno said it was), and must candidly confess that it was not at all
nice; and I could not feel surprised that so many of the guests had kept
their mouths shut up tight STOP "What's the soup made of, Bruno? STOP said Sylvie, who had put a spoonful of
it to her lips, and was making a wry face over it STOP And Bruno's answer was anything but encouraging STOP "Bits of things! STOP The entertainment was to conclude with "Bits of Shakespeare," as Sylvie
expressed it, which were all to be done by Bruno, Sylvie being fully
engaged in making the Frogs keep their heads towards the stage: after
which Bruno was to appear in his real character, and tell them a Story
of his own invention STOP "Will the Story have a Moral to it? STOP I asked Sylvie, while Bruno was
away behind the hedge, dressing for the first 'Bit. STOP "I think so," Sylvie replied doubtfully STOP "There generally is a Moral,
only he puts it in too soon. STOP "And will he say all the Bits of Shakespeare? STOP "No, he'll only act them," said Sylvie STOP "He knows hardly any of the
words STOP When I see what he's dressed like, I've to tell the Frogs what
character it is STOP They're always in such a hurry to guess STOP Don't you
hear them all saying 'What STOP What?' STOP And so indeed they were: it had only
sounded like croaking, till Sylvie explained it, but I could now make
out the "Wawt STOP Wawt? STOP quite distinctly STOP "But why do they try to guess it before they see it? STOP "I don't know," Sylvie said: "but they always do STOP Sometimes they begin
guessing weeks and weeks before the day! STOP (So now, when you hear the Frogs croaking in a particularly melancholy
way, you may be sure they're trying to guess Bruno's next Shakespeare
'Bit' STOP Isn't that interesting? STOP However, the chorus of guessing was cut short by Bruno, who suddenly
rushed on from behind the scenes, and took a flying leap down among the
Frogs, to re-arrange them STOP For the oldest and fattest Frog--who had never been properly arranged so
that he could see the stage, and so had no idea what was going on--was
getting restless, and had upset several of the Frogs, and turned others
round with their heads the wrong way STOP And it was no good at all, Bruno
said, to do a 'Bit' of Shakespeare when there was nobody to look at it
(you see he didn't count me as anybody) STOP So he set to work with a stick,
stirring them up, very much as you would stir up tea in a cup, till most
of them had at least one great stupid eye gazing at the stage STOP "Oo must come and sit among them, Sylvie," he said in despair, "I've
put these two side-by-side, with their noses the same way, ever so many
times, but they do squarrel so! STOP So Sylvie took her place as 'Mistress of the Ceremonies,' and Bruno
vanished again behind the scenes, to dress for the first 'Bit. STOP "Hamlet! STOP was suddenly proclaimed, in the clear sweet tones I knew so
well STOP The croaking all ceased in a moment, and I turned to the stage,
in some curiosity to see what Bruno's ideas were as to the behaviour of
Shakespeare's greatest Character STOP According to this eminent interpreter of the Drama, Hamlet wore a short
black cloak (which he chiefly used for muffling up his face, as if he
suffered a good deal from toothache), and turned out his toes very much
as he walked STOP "To be or not to be! STOP Hamlet remarked in a cheerful tone,
and then turned head-over-heels several times, his cloak dropping off in
the performance STOP I felt a little disappointed: Bruno's conception of the part seemed so
wanting in dignity STOP "Won't he say any more of the speech? STOP I whispered
to Sylvie STOP "I think not," Sylvie whispered in reply STOP "He generally turns
head-over-heels when he doesn't know any more words. STOP Bruno had meanwhile settled the question by disappearing from the stage;
and the Frogs instantly began inquiring the name of the next Character STOP "You'll know directly! STOP cried Sylvie, as she adjusted two or three young
Frogs that had struggled round with their backs to the stage STOP "Macbeth! STOP she added, as Bruno re-appeared STOP Macbeth had something twisted round him, that went over one shoulder and
under the other arm, and was meant, I believe, for a Scotch plaid STOP He
had a thorn in his hand, which he held out at arm's length, as if he
were a little afraid of it STOP "Is this a dagger? STOP Macbeth inquired, in a
puzzled sort of tone: and instantly a chorus of "Thorn STOP Thorn! STOP arose
from the Frogs (I had quite learned to understand their croaking by this
time) STOP "It's a dagger! STOP Sylvie proclaimed in a peremptory tone STOP "Hold your
tongues! STOP And the croaking ceased at once STOP Shakespeare has not told us, so far as I know, that Macbeth had any such
eccentric habit as turning head-over-heels in private life: but Bruno
evidently considered it quite an essential part of the character, and
left the stage in a series of somersaults STOP However, he was back again
in a few moments, having tucked under his chin the end of a tuft of
wool (probably left on the thorn by a wandering sheep), which made a
magnificent beard, that reached nearly down to his feet STOP "Shylock! STOP Sylvie proclaimed STOP "No, I beg your pardon! STOP she hastily
corrected herself, "King Lear STOP I hadn't noticed the crown. STOP (Bruno had
very cleverly provided one, which fitted him exactly, by cutting out the
centre of a dandelion to make room for his head. STOP King Lear folded his arms (to the imminent peril of his beard) and said,
in a mild explanatory tone, "Ay, every inch a king! STOP and then paused,
as if to consider how this could best be proved STOP And here, with all
possible deference to Bruno as a Shakespearian critic, I must express my
opinion that the poet did not mean his three great tragic heroes to be
so strangely alike in their personal habits; nor do I believe that he
would have accepted the faculty of turning head-over-heels as any proof
at all of royal descent STOP Yet it appeared that King Lear, after deep
meditation, could think of no other argument by which to prove his
kingship: and, as this was the last of the 'Bits' of Shakespeare ("We
never do more than three," Sylvie explained in a whisper), Bruno gave
the audience quite a long series of somersaults before he finally
retired, leaving the enraptured Frogs all crying out "More STOP More! STOP which
I suppose was their way of encoring a performance STOP But Bruno wouldn't
appear again, till the proper time came for telling the Story STOP {Image...The frogs' birthday-treat}

When he appeared at last in his real character, I noticed a remarkable
change in his behaviour STOP He tried no more somersaults STOP It was clearly his opinion that, however
suitable the habit of turning head-over-heels might be to such petty
individuals as Hamlet and King Lear, it would never do for Bruno to
sacrifice his dignity to such an extent STOP But it was equally clear that
he did not feel entirely at his ease, standing all alone on the stage,
with no costume to disguise him: and though he began, several times,
"There were a Mouse--," he kept glancing up and down, and on all sides,
as if in search of more comfortable quarters from which to tell the
Story STOP Standing on one side of the stage, and partly overshadowing it,
was a tall foxglove, which seemed, as the evening breeze gently swayed
it hither and thither, to offer exactly the sort of accommodation that
the orator desired STOP Having once decided on his quarters, it needed only
a second or two for him to run up the stem like a tiny squirrel, and
to seat himself astride on the topmost bend, where the fairy-bells
clustered most closely, and from whence he could look down on his
audience from such a height that all shyness vanished, and he began his
Story merrily STOP "Once there were a Mouse and a Crocodile and a Man and a Goat and a
Lion. STOP I had never heard the 'dramatis personae' tumbled into a story
with such profusion and in such reckless haste; and it fairly took my
breath away STOP Even Sylvie gave a little gasp, and allowed three of the
Frogs, who seemed to be getting tired of the entertainment, to hop away
into the ditch, without attempting to stop them STOP "And the Mouse found a Shoe, and it thought it were a Mouse-trap STOP So it
got right in, and it stayed in ever so long. STOP "Why did it stay in? STOP said Sylvie STOP Her function seemed to be much the
same as that of the Chorus in a Greek Play: she had to encourage the
orator, and draw him out, by a series of intelligent questions STOP "'Cause it thought it couldn't get out again," Bruno explained STOP "It were
a clever mouse STOP It knew it couldn't get out of traps! STOP "But why did it go in at all? STOP said Sylvie.

 STOP --and it jamp, and it jamp," Bruno proceeded, ignoring this question,
"and at last it got right out again STOP And it looked at the mark in the
Shoe STOP And the Man's name were in it STOP So it knew it wasn't its own Shoe. STOP "Had it thought it was? STOP said Sylvie STOP "Why, didn't I tell oo it thought it were a Mouse-trap? STOP the indignant
orator replied STOP "Please, Mister Sir, will oo make Sylvie attend? STOP Sylvie
was silenced, and was all attention: in fact, she and I were most of the
audience now, as the Frogs kept hopping away, and there were very few of
them left STOP "So the Mouse gave the Man his Shoe STOP And the Man were welly glad, cause
he hadn't got but one Shoe, and he were hopping to get the other. STOP Here I ventured on a question STOP "Do you mean 'hopping,' or 'hoping'? STOP "Bofe," said Bruno STOP "And the Man took the Goat out of the Sack. STOP ("We
haven't heard of the sack before," I said STOP "Nor you won't hear of it
again," said Bruno) STOP "And he said to the Goat, 'Oo will walk about here
till I comes back. STOP And he went and he tumbled into a deep hole STOP And the
Goat walked round and round STOP And it walked under the Tree STOP And it wug
its tail STOP And it looked up in the Tree STOP And it sang a sad little Song STOP Oo never heard such a sad little Song! STOP "Can you sing it, Bruno? STOP I asked STOP "Iss, I can," Bruno readily replied STOP "And I sa'n't STOP It would make Sylvie
cry--"

"It wouldn't!," Sylvie interrupted in great indignation STOP "And I don't
believe the Goat sang it at all! STOP "It did, though! STOP said Bruno STOP "It singed it right froo STOP I sawed it
singing with its long beard--"

"It couldn't sing with its beard," I said, hoping to puzzle the little
fellow: "a beard isn't a voice. STOP "Well then, oo couldn't walk with Sylvie! STOP Bruno cried triumphantly STOP "Sylvie isn't a foot! STOP I thought I had better follow Sylvie's example, and be silent for a
while STOP Bruno was too sharp for us STOP "And when it had singed all the Song, it ran away--for to get along to
look for the Man, oo know STOP And the Crocodile got along after it--for to
bite it, oo know STOP And the Mouse got along after the Crocodile. STOP "Wasn't the Crocodile running? STOP Sylvie enquired STOP She appealed to me STOP "Crocodiles do run, don't they? STOP I suggested "crawling" as the proper word STOP "He wasn't running," said Bruno, "and he wasn't crawling STOP He went
struggling along like a portmanteau STOP And he held his chin ever so high
in the air--"

"What did he do that for? STOP said Sylvie STOP "'cause he hadn't got a toofache! STOP said Bruno STOP "Ca'n't oo make out
nuffin wizout I 'splain it STOP Why, if he'd had a toofache, a course he'd
have held his head down--like this--and he'd have put a lot of warm
blankets round it! STOP "If he'd had any blankets," Sylvie argued STOP "Course he had blankets! STOP retorted her brother STOP "Doos oo think
Crocodiles goes walks wizout blankets STOP And he frowned with his eyebrows STOP And the Goat was welly flightened at his eyebrows! STOP "I'd never be afraid of eyebrows! STOP exclaimed Sylvie STOP "I should think oo would, though, if they'd got a Crocodile fastened to
them, like these had STOP And so the Man jamp, and he jamp, and at last he
got right out of the hole. STOP Sylvie gave another little gasp: this rapid dodging about among the
characters of the Story had taken away her breath STOP "And he runned away for to look for the Goat, oo know STOP And he heard the
Lion grunting---"

"Lions don't grunt," said Sylvie STOP "This one did," said Bruno STOP "And its mouth were like a large cupboard STOP And it had plenty of room in its mouth STOP And the Lion runned after the
Man for to eat him, oo know STOP And the Mouse runned after the Lion. STOP "But the Mouse was running after the Crocodile," I said: "he couldn't
run after both! STOP Bruno sighed over the density of his audience, but explained very
patiently STOP "He did runned after bofe: 'cause they went the same way STOP And
first he caught the Crocodile, and then he didn't catch the Lion STOP And
when he'd caught the Crocodile, what doos oo think he did--'cause he'd
got pincers in his pocket? STOP "I ca'n't guess," said Sylvie STOP {Image...'He wrenched out that crocodile's toof!' STOP "Nobody couldn't guess it! STOP Bruno cried in high glee STOP "Why, he wrenched
out that Crocodile's toof! STOP "Which tooth? STOP I ventured to ask STOP But Bruno was not to be puzzled STOP "The toof he were going to bite the
Goat with, a course! STOP "He couldn't be sure about that," I argued, "unless he wrenched out all
its teeth. STOP Bruno laughed merrily, and half sang, as he swung himself backwards and
forwards, "He did--wrenched--out--all its teef! STOP "Why did the Crocodile wait to have them wrenched out? STOP said Sylvie STOP "It had to wait," said Bruno STOP I ventured on another question STOP "But what became of the Man who said
'You may wait here till I come back'? STOP "He didn't say 'Oo may,'" Bruno explained STOP "He said, 'Oo will. STOP Just
like Sylvie says to me 'Oo will do oor lessons till twelve o'clock. STOP Oh,
I wiss," he added with a little sigh, "I wiss Sylvie would say 'Oo may
do oor lessons'! STOP This was a dangerous subject for discussion, Sylvie seemed to think STOP She
returned to the Story STOP "But what became of the Man? STOP "Well, the Lion springed at him STOP But it came so slow, it were three
weeks in the air--"

"Did the Man wait for it all that time? STOP I said STOP "Course he didn't! STOP Bruno replied, gliding head-first down the stem of
the fox-glove, for the Story was evidently close to its end STOP "He sold
his house, and he packed up his things, while the Lion were coming STOP And
he went and he lived in another town STOP So the Lion ate the wrong man. STOP This was evidently the Moral: so Sylvie made her final proclamation to
the Frogs STOP "The Story's finished STOP And whatever is to be learned from
it," she added, aside to me, "I'm sure I don't know! STOP I did not feel quite clear about it myself, so made no suggestion: but
the Frogs seemed quite content, Moral or no Moral, and merely raised a
husky chorus of "Off STOP Off! STOP as they hopped away STOP  STOP LOOKING EASTWARD STOP "It's just a week," I said, three days later, to Arthur, "since we heard
of Lady Muriel's engagement STOP I think I ought to call, at any rate, and
offer my congratulations STOP Won't you come with me? STOP A pained expression passed over his face STOP "When must you leave us? STOP he asked STOP "By the first train on Monday. STOP "Well--yes, I will come with you STOP It would seem strange and unfriendly
if I didn't STOP But this is only Friday STOP Give me till Sunday afternoon STOP I
shall be stronger then. STOP Shading his eyes with one hand, as if half-ashamed of the tears that
were coursing down his cheeks, he held the other out to me STOP It trembled
as I clasped it STOP I tried to frame some words of sympathy; but they seemed poor and cold,
and I left them unspoken STOP "Good night! STOP was all I said STOP "Good night, dear friend! STOP he replied STOP There was a manly vigour in his
tone that convinced me he was wrestling with, and triumphing over,
the great sorrow that had so nearly wrecked his life--and that, on the
stepping-stone of his dead self, he would surely rise to higher things STOP There was no chance, I was glad to think, as we set out on Sunday
afternoon, of meeting Eric at the Hall, as he had returned to town
the day after his engagement was announced STOP His presence might have
disturbed the calm--the almost unnatural calm--with which Arthur met
the woman who had won his heart, and murmured the few graceful words of
sympathy that the occasion demanded STOP Lady Muriel was perfectly radiant with happiness: sadness could not live
in the light of such a smile: and even Arthur brightened under it, and,
when she remarked "You see I'm watering my flowers, though it is the
Sabbath-Day," his voice had almost its old ring of cheerfulness as he
replied "Even on the Sabbath-Day works of mercy are allowed STOP But this
isn't the Sabbath-Day STOP The Sabbath-day has ceased to exist. STOP "I know it's not Saturday," Lady Muriel replied; "but isn't Sunday often
called 'the Christian Sabbath'? STOP "It is so called, I think, in recognition of the spirit of the Jewish
institution, that one day in seven should be a day of rest STOP But I hold
that Christians are freed from the literal observance of the Fourth
Commandment. STOP "Then where is our authority for Sunday observance? STOP "We have, first, the fact that the seventh day was 'sanctified', when
God rested from the work of Creation STOP That is binding on us as Theists STOP Secondly, we have the fact that 'the Lord's Day' is a Christian
institution STOP That is binding on us as Christians. STOP "And your practical rules would be--? STOP "First, as Theists, to keep it holy in some special way, and to make
it, so far as is reasonably possible, a day of rest STOP Secondly, as
Christians, to attend public worship. STOP "And what of amusements? STOP "I would say of them, as of all kinds of work, whatever is innocent on a
week-day, is innocent on Sunday, provided it does not interfere with the
duties of the day. STOP "Then you would allow children to play on Sunday? STOP "Certainly I should STOP Why make the day irksome to their restless
natures? STOP "I have a letter somewhere," said Lady Muriel, "from an old friend,
describing the way in which Sunday was kept in her younger days STOP I will
fetch it for you. STOP "I had a similar description, viva voce, years ago," Arthur said when
she had left us, "from a little girl STOP It was really touching to hear
the melancholy tone in which she said 'On Sunday I mustn't play with my
doll STOP On Sunday I mustn't run on the sands STOP On Sunday I mustn't dig
in the garden! STOP Poor child STOP She had indeed abundant cause for hating
Sunday! STOP "Here is the letter," said Lady Muriel, returning STOP "Let me read you a
piece of it. STOP "When, as a child, I first opened my eyes on a Sunday-morning, a feeling
of dismal anticipation, which began at least on the Friday, culminated STOP I knew what was before me, and my wish, if not my word, was 'Would
God it were evening! STOP It was no day of rest, but a day of texts,
of catechisms (Watts'), of tracts about converted swearers, godly
charwomen, and edifying deaths of sinners saved STOP "Up with the lark, hymns and portions of Scripture had to be learned by
heart till 8 o'clock, when there were family-prayers, then breakfast,
which I was never able to enjoy, partly from the fast already undergone,
and partly from the outlook I dreaded STOP "At 9 came Sunday-School; and it made me indignant to be put into
the class with the village-children, as well as alarmed lest, by some
mistake of mine, I should be put below them STOP "The Church-Service was a veritable Wilderness of Zin STOP I wandered in
it, pitching the tabernacle of my thoughts on the lining of the square
family-pew, the fidgets of my small brothers, and the horror of knowing
that, on the Monday, I should have to write out, from memory, jottings
of the rambling disconnected extempore sermon, which might have had any
text but its own, and to stand or fall by the result STOP "This was followed by a cold dinner at 1 (servants to have no work),
Sunday-School again from 2 to 4, and Evening-Service at 6 STOP The intervals
were perhaps the greatest trial of all, from the efforts I had to make,
to be less than usually sinful, by reading books and sermons as barren
as the Dead Sea STOP There was but one rosy spot, in the distance, all that
day: and that was 'bed-time,' which never could come too early! STOP "Such teaching was well meant, no doubt," said Arthur; "but it must
have driven many of its victims into deserting the Church-Services
altogether. STOP "I'm afraid I was a deserter this morning," she gravely said STOP "I had
to write to Eric STOP Would you--would you mind my telling you something he
said about prayer STOP It had never struck me in that light before. STOP "In what light? STOP said Arthur STOP "Why, that all Nature goes by fixed, regular laws--Science has proved
that STOP So that asking God to do anything (except of course praying for
spiritual blessings) is to expect a miracle: and we've no right to do
that STOP I've not put it as well as he did: but that was the outcome of
it, and it has confused me STOP Please tell me what you can say in answer to
it. STOP "I don't propose to discuss Captain Lindon's difficulties," Arthur
gravely replied; "specially as he is not present STOP But, if it is your
difficulty," (his voice unconsciously took a tenderer tone) "then I will
speak. STOP "It is my difficulty," she said anxiously STOP "Then I will begin by asking 'Why did you except spiritual blessings? STOP Is not your mind a part of Nature? STOP "Yes, but Free-Will comes in there--I can choose this or that; and God
can influence my choice. STOP "Then you are not a Fatalist? STOP "Oh, no! STOP she earnestly exclaimed STOP "Thank God! STOP Arthur said to himself, but in so low a whisper that only
I heard it STOP "You grant then that I can, by an act of free choice, move
this cup," suiting the action to the word, "this way or that way? STOP "Yes, I grant it. STOP "Well, let us see how far the result is produced by fixed laws STOP The cup
moves because certain mechanical forces are impressed on it by my hand STOP My hand moves because certain forces--electric, magnetic, or whatever
'nerve-force' may prove to be--are impressed on it by my brain STOP This
nerve-force, stored in the brain, would probably be traceable, if
Science were complete, to chemical forces supplied to the brain by
the blood, and ultimately derived from the food I eat and the air I
breathe. STOP "But would not that be Fatalism STOP Where would Free-Will come in? STOP "In choice of nerves," replied Arthur STOP "The nerve-force in the brain may
flow just as naturally down one nerve as down another STOP We need something
more than a fixed Law of Nature to settle which nerve shall carry it STOP That 'something' is Free-Will. STOP Her eyes sparkled STOP "I see what you mean! STOP she exclaimed STOP "Human
Free-Will is an exception to the system of fixed Law STOP Eric said
something like that STOP And then I think he pointed out that God can only
influence Nature by influencing Human Wills STOP So that we might reasonably
pray 'give us this day our daily bread,' because many of the causes that
produce bread are under Man's control STOP But to pray for rain, or fine
weather, would be as unreasonable as--" she checked herself, as if
fearful of saying something irreverent STOP In a hushed, low tone, that trembled with emotion, and with the
solemnity of one in the presence of death, Arthur slowly replied "Shalt
he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him STOP Shall we 'the swarm
that in the noontide beam were born,' feeling in ourselves the power to
direct, this way or that, the forces of Nature--of Nature, of which we
form so trivial a part--shall we, in our boundless arrogance, in our
pitiful conceit, deny that power to the Ancient of Days STOP Saying, to
our Creator, 'Thus far and no further STOP Thou madest, but thou canst not
rule!'? STOP Lady Muriel had covered her face in her hands, and did not look up STOP She
only murmured "Thanks, thanks! STOP again and again STOP We rose to go STOP Arthur said, with evident effort, "One word more STOP If you
would know the power of Prayer--in anything and everything that Man can
need try it STOP Ask, and it shall be given you STOP I--have tried it STOP I know
that God answers prayer! STOP Our walk home was a silent one, till we had nearly reached the
lodgings: then Arthur murmured--and it was almost an echo of my own
thoughts--"What knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
husband? STOP The subject was not touched on again STOP We sat on, talking, while hour
after hour, of this our last night together, glided away unnoticed STOP He
had much to tell me about India, and the new life he was going to, and
the work he hoped to do STOP And his great generous soul seemed so filled
with noble ambition as to have no space left for any vain regret or
selfish repining STOP "Come, it is nearly morning STOP Arthur said at last, rising and leading the
way upstairs STOP "The sun will be rising in a few minutes: and, though I have basely
defrauded you of your last chance of a night's rest here, I'm sure
you'll forgive me: for I really couldn't bring myself to say 'Good
night' sooner STOP And God knows whether you'll ever see me again, or hear
of me! STOP "Hear of you I am certain I shall! STOP I warmly responded, and quoted the
concluding lines of that strange poem 'Waring':--


    "Oh, never star
    Was lost here, but it rose afar
    Look East, where whole new thousands are STOP In Vishnu-land what Avatar? STOP "Aye, look Eastward! STOP Arthur eagerly replied, pausing at the stair-case
window, which commanded a fine view of the sea and the eastward horizon STOP "The West is the fitting tomb for all the sorrow and the sighing, all
the errors and the follies of the Past: for all its withered Hopes and
all its buried Loves STOP From the East comes new strength, new ambition,
new Hope, new Life, new Love STOP Look Eastward STOP Aye, look Eastward! STOP His last words were still ringing in my ears as I entered my room, and
undrew the window-curtains, just in time to see the sun burst in glory
from his ocean-prison, and clothe the world in the light of a new day STOP "So may it be for him, and me, and all of us! STOP I mused STOP "All that is
evil, and dead, and hopeless, fading with the Night that is past STOP All
that is good, and living, and hopeful, rising with the dawn of Day STOP "Fading, with the Night, the chilly mists, and the noxious vapours,
and the heavy shadows, and the wailing gusts, and the owl's melancholy
hootings: rising, with the Day, the darting shafts of light, and the
wholesome morning breeze, and the warmth of a dawning life, and the mad
music of the lark STOP Look Eastward STOP "Fading, with the Night, the clouds of ignorance, and the deadly blight
of sin, and the silent tears of sorrow: and ever rising, higher, higher,
with the Day, the radiant dawn of knowledge, and the sweet breath of
purity, and the throb of a world's ecstasy STOP Look Eastward STOP {Image...'Look eastward!' STOP "Fading, with the Night, the memory of a dead love, and the withered
leaves of a blighted hope, and the sickly repinings and moody regrets
that numb the best energies of the soul: and rising, broadening, rolling
upward like a living flood, the manly resolve, and the dauntless will,
and the heavenward gaze of faith--the substance of things hoped for, the
evidence of things not seen STOP "Look Eastward STOP Aye, look Eastward! STOP PREFACE STOP One little picture in this book, the Magic Locket, at p. 77, was drawn
by 'Miss Alice Havers. STOP I did not state this on the title-page, since
it seemed only due, to the artist of all these (to my mind) wonderful
pictures, that his name should stand there alone STOP The descriptions, at pp STOP 386, 387, of Sunday as spent by children of
the last generation, are quoted verbatim from a speech made to me by a
child-friend and a letter written to me by a lady-friend STOP The Chapters, headed 'Fairy Sylvie' and 'Bruno's Revenge,' are a
reprint, with a few alterations, of a little fairy-tale which I wrote in
the year 1867, at the request of the late Mrs. Gatty, for 'Aunt Judy's
Magazine,' which she was then editing STOP It was in 1874, I believe, that the idea first occurred to me of making
it the nucleus of a longer story STOP As the years went on, I jotted down,
at odd moments, all sorts of odd ideas, and fragments of dialogue, that
occurred to me--who knows how?--with a transitory suddenness that left
me no choice but either to record them then and there, or to abandon
them to oblivion STOP Sometimes one could trace to their source these random
flashes of thought--as being suggested by the book one was reading,
or struck out from the 'flint' of one's own mind by the 'steel' of
a friend's chance remark but they had also a way of their own, of
occurring, a propos of nothing--specimens of that hopelessly illogical
phenomenon, 'an effect without a cause. STOP Such, for example, was the last
line of 'The Hunting of the Snark,' which came into my head (as I have
already related in 'The Theatre' for April, 1887) quite suddenly, during
a solitary walk: and such, again, have been passages which occurred in
dreams, and which I cannot trace to any antecedent cause whatever STOP There
are at least two instances of such dream-suggestions in this book--one,
my Lady's remark, 'it often runs in families, just as a love for pastry
does', at p. 88; the other, Eric Lindon's badinage about having been
in domestic service, at p. 332 STOP And thus it came to pass that I found
myself at last in possession of a huge unwieldy mass of litterature--if
the reader will kindly excuse the spelling--which only needed stringing
together, upon the thread of a consecutive story, to constitute the book
I hoped to write STOP Only STOP The task, at first, seemed absolutely hopeless,
and gave me a far clearer idea, than I ever had before, of the meaning
of the word 'chaos': and I think it must have been ten years, or more,
before I had succeeded in classifying these odds-and-ends sufficiently
to see what sort of a story they indicated: for the story had to grow
out of the incidents, not the incidents out of the story I am telling
all this, in no spirit of egoism, but because I really believe that some
of my readers will be interested in these details of the 'genesis' of
a book, which looks so simple and straight-forward a matter, when
completed, that they might suppose it to have been written straight off,
page by page, as one would write a letter, beginning at the beginning;
and ending at the end STOP It is, no doubt, possible to write a story in that way: and, if it be
not vanity to say so, I believe that I could, myself,--if I were in the
unfortunate position (for I do hold it to be a real misfortune) of being
obliged to produce a given amount of fiction in a given time,--that I
could 'fulfil my task,' and produce my 'tale of bricks,' as other slaves
have done STOP One thing, at any rate, I could guarantee as to the story so
produced--that it should be utterly commonplace, should contain no new
ideas whatever, and should be very very weary reading STOP This species of literature has received the very appropriate name of
'padding' which might fitly be defined as 'that which all can write and
none can read. STOP That the present volume contains no such writing I dare
not avow: sometimes, in order to bring a picture into its proper place,
it has been necessary to eke out a page with two or three extra lines:
but I can honestly say I have put in no more than I was absolutely
compelled to do STOP My readers may perhaps like to amuse themselves by trying to detect, in
a given passage, the one piece of 'padding' it contains STOP While arranging
the 'slips' into pages, I found that the passage, whichnow extends
from the top of p. 35 to the middle of p. 38, was 3 lines too short STOP I supplied the deficiency, not by interpolating a word here and a word
there, but by writing in 3 consecutive lines STOP Now can my readers guess
which they are STOP A harder puzzle if a harder be desired would be to determine, as to the
Gardener's Song, in which cases (if any) the stanza was adapted to the
surrounding text, and in which (if any) the text was adapted to the
stanza STOP Perhaps the hardest thing in all literature--at least I have found it
so: by no voluntary effort can I accomplish it: I have to take it as it
come's is to write anything original STOP And perhaps the easiest is, when
once an original line has been struck out, to follow it up, and to write
any amount more to the same tune STOP I do not know if 'Alice in Wonderland'
was an original story--I was, at least, no conscious imitator in writing
it--but I do know that, since it came out, something like a dozen
story-books have appeared, on identically the same pattern STOP The path I
timidly explored believing myself to be 'the first that ever burst into
that silent sea'--is now a beaten high-road: all the way-side flowers
have long ago been trampled into the dust: and it would be courting
disaster for me to attempt that style again STOP Hence it is that, in 'Sylvie and Bruno,' I have striven with I know not
what success to strike out yet another new path: be it bad or good, it
is the best I can do STOP It is written, not for money, and not for fame,
but in the hope of supplying, for the children whom I love, some
thoughts that may suit those hours of innocent merriment which are the
very life of Childhood; and also in the hope of suggesting, to them and
to others, some thoughts that may prove, I would fain hope, not wholly
out of harmony with the graver cadences of Life STOP If I have not already exhausted the patience of my readers, I would like
to seize this opportunity perhaps the last I shall have of addressing so
many friends at once of putting on record some ideas that have occurred
to me, as to books desirable to be written--which I should much like to
attempt, but may not ever have the time or power to carry through--in
the hope that, if I should fail (and the years are gliding away very
fast) to finish the task I have set myself, other hands may take it up STOP First, a Child's Bible STOP The only real essentials of this would be,
carefully selected passages, suitable for a child's reading and
pictures STOP One principle of selection, which I would adopt, would be that
Religion should be put before a child as a revelation of love no need to
pain and puzzle the young mind with the history of crime and punishment STOP (On such a principle I should, for example, omit the history of the
Flood. STOP The supplying of the pictures would involve no great difficulty:
no new ones would be needed: hundreds of excellent pictures already
exist, the copyright of which has long ago expired, and which simply
need photo-zincography, or some similar process, for their successful
reproduction STOP The book should be handy in size with a pretty attractive
looking cover--in a clear legible type--and, above all, with abundance
of pictures, pictures, pictures STOP Secondly, a book of pieces selected from the Bible--not single texts,
but passages of from 10 to 20 verses each--to be committed to memory STOP Such passages would be found useful, to repeat to one's self and
to ponder over, on many occasions when reading is difficult, if
not impossible: for instance, when lying awake at night--on a
railway-journey--when taking a solitary walk-in old age, when eye-sight
is failing of wholly lost--and, best of all, when illness, while
incapacitating us for reading or any other occupation, condemns us to
lie awake through many weary silent hours: at such a time how keenly
one may realise the truth of David's rapturous cry 'O how sweet are thy
words unto my throat: yea, sweeter than honey unto my mouth! STOP I have said 'passages,' rather than single texts, because we have no
means of recalling single texts: memory needs links, and here are none:
one may have a hundred texts stored in the memory, and not be able
to recall, at will, more than half-a-dozen--and those by mere chance:
whereas, once get hold of any portion of a chapter that has been
committed to memory, and the whole can be recovered: all hangs together STOP Thirdly, a collection of passages, both prose and verse, from books
other than the Bible STOP There is not perhaps much, in what is called
'un-inspired' literature (a misnomer, I hold: if Shakespeare was not
inspired, one may well doubt if any man ever was), that will bear the
process of being pondered over, a hundred times: still there are such
passages--enough, I think, to make a goodly store for the memory STOP These two books of sacred, and secular, passages for memory--will serve
other good purposes besides merely occupying vacant hours: they
will help to keep at bay many anxious thoughts, worrying thoughts,
uncharitable thoughts, unholy thoughts STOP Let me say this, in better
words than my own, by copying a passage from that most interesting book,
Robertson's Lectures on the Epistles to the Corinthians, Lecture XLIX STOP "If a man finds himself haunted by evil desires and unholy images, which
will generally be at periodical hours, let him commit to memory passages
of Scripture, or passages from the best writers in verse or prose STOP Let
him store his mind with these, as safeguards to repeat when he lies
awake in some restless night, or when despairing imaginations, or
gloomy, suicidal thoughts, beset him STOP Let these be to him the sword,
turning everywhere to keep the way of the Garden of Life from the
intrusion of profaner footsteps. STOP Fourthly, a "Shakespeare" for girls: that is, an edition in which
everything, not suitable for the perusal of girls of (say) from 10
to 17, should be omitted STOP Few children under 10 would be likely to
understand or enjoy the greatest of poets: and those, who have passed
out of girlhood, may safely be left to read Shakespeare, in any edition,
'expurgated' or not, that they may prefer: but it seems a pity that
so many children, in the intermediate stage, should be debarred from
a great pleasure for want of an edition suitable to them STOP Neither
Bowdler's, Chambers's, Brandram's, nor Cundell's 'Boudoir' Shakespeare,
seems to me to meet the want: they are not sufficiently 'expurgated. STOP Bowdler's is the most extraordinary of all: looking through it, I am
filled with a deep sense of wonder, considering what he has left in,
that he should have cut anything out STOP Besides relentlessly erasing all
that is unsuitable on the score of reverence or decency, I should be
inclined to omit also all that seems too difficult, or not likely
to interest young readers STOP The resulting book might be slightly
fragmentary: but it would be a real treasure to all British maidens who
have any taste for poetry STOP If it be needful to apologize to any one for the new departure I have
taken in this story--by introducing, along with what will, I hope, prove
to be acceptable nonsense for children, some of the graver thoughts of
human life--it must be to one who has learned the Art of keeping such
thoughts wholly at a distance in hours of mirth and careless ease STOP To
him such a mixture will seem, no doubt, ill-judged and repulsive STOP And
that such an Art exists I do not dispute: with youth, good health, and
sufficient money, it seems quite possible to lead, for years together,
a life of unmixed gaiety--with the exception of one solemn fact, with
which we are liable to be confronted at any moment, even in the midst
of the most brilliant company or the most sparkling entertainment STOP A
man may fix his own times for admitting serious thought, for attending
public worship, for prayer, for reading the Bible: all such matters he
can defer to that 'convenient season', which is so apt never to occur
at all: but he cannot defer, for one single moment, the necessity of
attending to a message, which may come before he has finished reading
this page,' this night shalt thy soul be required of thee. STOP The ever-present sense of this grim possibility has been, in all ages,


     Note... At the moment, when I had written these words, there
     was a knock at the door, and a telegram was brought me,
     announcing the sudden death of a dear friend STOP an incubus that men have striven to shake off STOP Few more interesting
subjects of enquiry could be found, by a student of history, than the
various weapons that have been used against this shadowy foe STOP Saddest
of all must have been the thoughts of those who saw indeed an
existence beyond the grave, but an existence far more terrible than
annihilation--an existence as filmy, impalpable, all but invisible
spectres, drifting about, through endless ages, in a world of shadows,
with nothing to do, nothing to hope for, nothing to love STOP In the midst
of the gay verses of that genial 'bon vivant' Horace, there stands one
dreary word whose utter sadness goes to one's heart STOP It is the word
'exilium' in the well-known passage


    Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium
    Versatur urna serius ocius
    Sors exitura et nos in aeternum
    Exilium impositura cymbae STOP Yes, to him this present life--spite of all its weariness and all its
sorrow--was the only life worth having: all else was 'exile' STOP Does it
not seem almost incredible that one, holding such a creed, should ever
have smiled STOP And many in this day, I fear, even though believing in an existence
beyond the grave far more real than Horace ever dreamed of, yet regard
it as a sort of 'exile' from all the joys of life, and so adopt Horace's
theory, and say 'let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. STOP We go to entertainments, such as the theatre--I say 'we', for I also
go to the play, whenever I get a chance of seeing a really good one and
keep at arm's length, if possible, the thought that we may not return
alive STOP Yet how do you know--dear friend, whose patience has carried you
through this garrulous preface that it may not be your lot, when mirth
is fastest and most furious, to feel the sharp pang, or the deadly
faintness, which heralds the final crisis--to see, with vague wonder,
anxious friends bending over you to hear their troubled whispers perhaps
yourself to shape the question, with trembling lips, "Is it serious STOP ",
and to be told "Yes: the end is near" (and oh, how different all Life
will look when those words are said! STOP --how do you know, I say, that all
this may not happen to you, this night STOP And dare you, knowing this, say to yourself "Well, perhaps it is an
immoral play: perhaps the situations are a little too 'risky', the
dialogue a little too strong, the 'business' a little too suggestive STOP I
don't say that conscience is quite easy: but the piece is so clever, I
must see it this once STOP I'll begin a stricter life to-morrow. STOP To-morrow,
and to-morrow, and tomorrow STOP "Who sins in hope, who, sinning, says,
   'Sorrow for sin God's judgement stays! STOP Against God's Spirit he lies; quite stops
   Mercy with insult; dares, and drops,
   Like a scorch'd fly, that spins in vain
   Upon the axis of its pain,
   Then takes its doom, to limp and crawl,
   Blind and forgot, from fall to fall. STOP Let me pause for a moment to say that I believe this thought, of the
possibility of death--if calmly realised, and steadily faced would be
one of the best possible tests as to our going to any scene of amusement
being right or wrong STOP If the thought of sudden death acquires, for you,
a special horror when imagined as happening in a theatre, then be very
sure the theatre is harmful for you, however harmless it may be for
others; and that you are incurring a deadly peril in going STOP Be sure the
safest rule is that we should not dare to live in any scene in which we
dare not die STOP But, once realise what the true object is in life--that it is not
pleasure, not knowledge, not even fame itself, 'that last infirmity of
noble minds'--but that it is the development of character, the rising
to a higher, nobler, purer standard, the building-up of the perfect
Man--and then, so long as we feel that this is going on, and will (we
trust) go on for evermore, death has for us no terror; it is not a
shadow, but a light; not an end, but a beginning STOP One other matter may perhaps seem to call for apology--that I should
have treated with such entire want of sympathy the British passion for
'Sport', which no doubt has been in by-gone days, and is still, in
some forms of it, an excellent school for hardihood and for coolness in
moments of danger STOP But I am not entirely without sympathy for genuine
'Sport': I can heartily admire the courage of the man who, with severe
bodily toil, and at the risk of his life, hunts down some 'man-eating'
tiger: and I can heartily sympathize with him when he exults in the
glorious excitement of the chase and the hand-to-hand struggle with the
monster brought to bay STOP But I can but look with deep wonder and sorrow
on the hunter who, at his ease and in safety, can find pleasure in what
involves, for some defenceless creature, wild terror and a death of
agony: deeper, if the hunter be one who has pledged himself to preach
to men the Religion of universal Love: deepest of all, if it be one of
those 'tender and delicate' beings, whose very name serves as a
symbol of Love--'thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of
women'--whose mission here is surely to help and comfort all that are in
pain or sorrow STOP 'Farewell, farewell STOP but this I tell
   To thee, thou Wedding-Guest STOP He prayeth well, who loveth well
   Both man and bird and beast STOP He prayeth best, who loveth best
   All things both great and small;
   For the dear God who loveth us,
   He made and loveth all. STOP End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Sylvie and Bruno, by Lewis Carroll

that such an Art _exists_ I do not dispute: with youth, good health, and
sufficient money, it seems quite possible to lead, for years together, a
life of unmixed gaietywith the exception of one solemn fact, with which
we are liable to be confronted at _any_ moment, even in the midst of the
most brilliant company or the most sparkling entertainment STOP A man may
fix his own times for admitting serious thought, for attending public
worship, for prayer, for reading the Bible: all such matters he can
defer to that convenient season, which is so apt never to occur at
all: but he cannot defer, for one single moment, the necessity of
attending to a message, which may come before he has finished reading
this page, _this night shall thy soul be required of thee_ STOP The ever-present sense of this grim possibility has been, in all
ages,[1] an incubus that men have striven to shake off STOP Few more
interesting subjects of enquiry could be found, by a student of history,
than the various weapons that have been used against this shadowy foe STOP Saddest of all must have been the thoughts of those who saw indeed an
_existence_ beyond the grave, but an existence far more terrible than
annihilationan existence as filmy, impalpable, all but invisible
spectres, drifting about, through endless ages, in a world of shadows,
with nothing to do, nothing to hope for, nothing to love STOP In the midst
of the gay verses of that genial bon vivant Horace, there stands one
dreary word whose utter sadness goes to ones heart STOP It is the word
_exilium_ in the well-known passage

  Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium
  Versatur urna serius ocius
    Sors exitura et nos in ternum
      Exilium impositura cymb STOP Yes, to him this present lifespite of all its weariness and all its
sorrowwas the only life worth having: all else was exile STOP Does it not
seem almost incredible that one, holding such a creed, should ever have
smiled STOP And many in this day, I fear, even though believing in an existence
beyond the grave far more real than Horace ever dreamed of, yet regard
it as a sort of exile from all the joys of life, and so adopt Horaces
theory, and say let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die STOP We go to entertainments, such as the theatreI say we, for _I_ also go
to the play, whenever I get a chance of seeing a really good oneand
keep at arms length, if possible, the thought that we may not return
alive STOP Yet how do you knowdear friend, whose patience has carried you
through this garrulous prefacethat it may not be _your_ lot, when mirth
is fastest and most furious, to feel the sharp pang, or the deadly
faintness, which heralds the final crisisto see, with vague wonder,
anxious friends bending over youto hear their troubled whispersperhaps
yourself to shape the question, with trembling lips, Is it serious?,
and to be told Yes: the end is near (and oh, how different all Life
will look when those words are said STOP )how do you know, I say, that all
this may not happen to _you_, this night STOP And _dare_ you, knowing this, say to yourself Well, perhaps it _is_ an
immoral play: perhaps the situations _are_ a little too risky, the
dialogue a little too strong, the business a little too suggestive STOP I
dont say that conscience is _quite_ easy: but the piece is so clever, I
must see it this once STOP Ill begin a stricter life to-morrow STOP _To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow!_

  Who sins in hope, who, sinning, says,
  Sorrow for sin Gods judgement stays STOP Against Gods Spirit he lies; quite stops
  Mercy with insult; dares, and drops,
  Like a scorchd fly, that spins in vain
  Upon the axis of its pain,
  Then takes its doom, to limp and crawl,
  Blind and forgot, from fall to fall STOP Let me pause for a moment to say that I believe this thought, of the
possibility of deathif calmly realised, and steadily facedwould be one
of the best possible tests as to our going to any scene of amusement
being right or wrong STOP If the thought of sudden death acquires, for
_you_, a special horror when imagined as happening in a _theatre_, then
be very sure the theatre is harmful for _you_, however harmless it may
be for others; and that _you_ are incurring a deadly peril in going STOP Be
sure the safest rule is that we should not dare to _live_ in any scene
in which we dare not _die_ STOP But, once realise what the true object _is_ in lifethat it is _not_
pleasure, _not_ knowledge, _not_ even fame itself, that last infirmity
of noble mindsbut that it _is_ the development of _character_, the
rising to a higher, nobler, purer standard, the building-up of the
perfect _Man_and then, so long as we feel that this is going on, and
will (we trust) go on for evermore, death has for us no terror; it is
not a shadow, but a light; not an end, but a beginning STOP One other matter may perhaps seem to call for apologythat I should have
treated with such entire want of sympathy the British passion for
Sport, which no doubt has been in by-gone days, and is still, in some
forms of it, an excellent school for hardihood and for coolness in
moments of danger STOP But I am not entirely without sympathy for _genuine_
Sport: I can heartily admire the courage of the man who, with severe
bodily toil, and at the risk of his life, hunts down some man-eating
tiger: and I can heartily sympathize with him when he exults in the
glorious excitement of the chase and the hand-to-hand struggle with the
monster brought to bay STOP But I can but look with deep wonder and sorrow
on the hunter who, at his ease and in safety, can find pleasure in what
involves, for some defenceless creature, wild terror and a death of
agony: deeper, if the hunter be one who has pledged himself to preach to
men the Religion of universal Love: deepest of all, if it be one of
those _tender and delicate_ beings, whose very name serves as a symbol
of Love_thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of
women_whose mission here is surely to help and comfort all that are in
pain or sorrow STOP Farewell, farewell STOP but this I tell
    To thee, thou Wedding-Guest STOP He prayeth well, who loveth well
    Both man and bird and beast STOP He prayeth best, who loveth best
    All things both great and small;
  For the dear God who loveth us,
    He made and loveth all STOP CONTENTS STOP CHAPTER                                                            PAGE

                           SYLVIE AND BRUNO STOP  STOP LESS BREAD STOP MORE TAXES STOP and then all the people cheered again, and one man, who was more
excited than the rest, flung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as
well as I could make out) Who roar for the Sub-Warden STOP _Everybody_
roared, but whether it was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly
appear: some were shouting Bread STOP and some Taxes!, but no one seemed
to know what it was they really wanted STOP All this I saw from the open window of the Wardens breakfast-saloon,
looking across the shoulder of the Lord Chancellor, who had sprung to
his feet the moment the shouting began, almost as if he had been
expecting it, and had rushed to the window which commanded the best view
of the market-place STOP What _can_ it all mean STOP he kept repeating to himself, as, with his
hands clasped behind him, and his gown floating in the air, he paced
rapidly up and down the room STOP I never heard such shouting beforeand at
this time of the morning, too STOP And with such unanimity STOP Doesnt it
strike _you_ as very remarkable STOP I represented, modestly, that to _my_ ears it appeared that they were
shouting for different things, but the Chancellor would not listen to my
suggestion for a moment STOP They all shout the same words, I assure you STOP he said: then, leaning well out of the window, he whispered to a man who
was standing close underneath, Keep em together, cant you STOP The
Warden will be here directly STOP Give em the signal for the march up STOP All
this was evidently not meant for _my_ ears, but I could scarcely help
hearing it, considering that my chin was almost on the Chancellors
shoulder STOP [Illustration: THE MARCH-UP]

The march up was a very curious sight: a straggling procession of men,
marching two and two, began from the other side of the market-place, and
advanced in an irregular zig-zag fashion towards the Palace, wildly
tacking from side to side, like a sailing vessel making way against an
unfavourable windso that the head of the procession was often further
from us at the end of one tack than it had been at the end of the
previous one STOP Yet it was evident that all was being done under orders, for I noticed
that all eyes were fixed on the man who stood just under the window, and
to whom the Chancellor was continually whispering STOP This man held his hat
in one hand and a little green flag in the other: whenever he waved the
flag the procession advanced a little nearer, when he dipped it they
sidled a little farther off, and whenever he waved his hat they all
raised a hoarse cheer STOP Hoo-roah STOP they cried, carefully keeping time
with the hat as it bobbed up and down STOP Hoo-roah STOP Noo STOP Consti STOP Tooshun STOP Less STOP Bread STOP More STOP Taxes STOP Thatll do, thatll do STOP the Chancellor whispered STOP Let em rest a bit
till I give you the word STOP Hes not here yet STOP But at this moment the
great folding-doors of the saloon were flung open, and he turned with a
guilty start to receive His High Excellency STOP However it was only Bruno,
and the Chancellor gave a little gasp of relieved anxiety STOP Morning STOP said the little fellow, addressing the remark, in a general
sort of way, to the Chancellor and the waiters STOP Doos oo know where
Sylvie is STOP Is looking for Sylvie STOP Shes with the Warden, I believe, yreince STOP the Chancellor replied
with a low bow STOP There was, no doubt, a certain amount of absurdity in
applying this title (which, as of course you see without my telling you,
was nothing but your Royal Highness condensed into one syllable) to a
small creature whose father was merely the Warden of Outland: still,
large excuse must be made for a man who had passed several years at the
Court of Fairyland, and had there acquired the almost impossible art of
pronouncing five syllables as one STOP But the bow was lost upon Bruno, who had run out of the room, even while
the great feat of The Unpronounceable Monosyllable was being
triumphantly performed STOP Just then, a single voice in the distance was understood to shout A
speech from the Chancellor STOP Certainly, my friends STOP the Chancellor
replied with extraordinary promptitude STOP You shall have a speech STOP Here
one of the waiters, who had been for some minutes busy making a
queer-looking mixture of egg and sherry, respectfully presented it on a
large silver salver STOP The Chancellor took it haughtily, drank it off
thoughtfully, smiled benevolently on the happy waiter as he set down the
empty glass, and began STOP To the best of my recollection this is what he
said STOP Ahem STOP Ahem STOP Ahem STOP Fellow-sufferers, or rather suffering fellows
(Dont call em names STOP muttered the man under the window STOP I didnt
say _felons_ STOP the Chancellor explained. STOP You may be sure that I always
sympa (Ear, ear STOP shouted the crowd, so loudly as quite to drown
the orators thin squeaky voice) that I always sympa he repeated STOP (Dont simper quite so much STOP said the man under the window STOP It makes
yer look a hidiot STOP And, all this time, Ear, ear STOP went rumbling
round the market-place, like a peal of thunder. STOP That I always
_sympathise_ STOP yelled the Chancellor, the first moment there was
silence STOP But your _true_ friend is the _Sub-Warden_ STOP Day and night he
is brooding on your wrongsI should say your _rights_that is to say
your _wrongs_no, I mean your _rights_ (Dont talk no more STOP growled
the man under the window STOP Youre making a mess of it! STOP At this moment
the Sub-Warden entered the saloon STOP He was a thin man, with a mean and
crafty face, and a greenish-yellow complexion; and he crossed the room
very slowly, looking suspiciously about him as if he thought there might
be a savage dog hidden somewhere STOP Bravo STOP he cried, patting the
Chancellor on the back STOP You did that speech very well indeed STOP Why,
youre a born orator, man STOP Oh, thats nothing STOP the Chancellor replied, modestly, with downcast
eyes STOP Most orators are _born_, you know STOP The Sub-Warden thoughtfully rubbed his chin STOP Why, so they are STOP he
admitted STOP I never considered it in that light STOP Still, you did it very
well STOP A word in your ear STOP The rest of their conversation was all in whispers: so, as I could hear
no more, I thought I would go and find Bruno STOP I found the little fellow standing in the passage, and being addressed
by one of the men in livery, who stood before him, nearly bent double
from extreme respectfulness, with his hands hanging in front of him like
the fins of a fish STOP His High Excellency, this respectful man was
saying, is in his Study, yreince STOP (He didnt pronounce this quite so
well as the Chancellor. STOP Thither Bruno trotted, and I thought it well to
follow him STOP The Warden, a tall dignified man with a grave but very pleasant face,
was seated before a writing-table, which was covered with papers, and
holding on his knee one of the sweetest and loveliest little maidens it
has ever been my lot to see STOP She looked four or five years older than
Bruno, but she had the same rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes, and the same
wealth of curly brown hair STOP Her eager smiling face was turned upwards
towards her fathers, and it was a pretty sight to see the mutual love
with which the two facesone in the Spring of Life, the other in its
late Autumnwere gazing on each other STOP No, youve never seen him, the old man was saying: you couldnt, you
know, hes been away so longtraveling from land to land, and seeking
for health, more years than youve been alive, little Sylvie STOP Here Bruno climbed upon his other knee, and a good deal of kissing, on a
rather complicated system, was the result STOP He only came back last night, said the Warden, when the kissing was
over: hes been traveling post-haste, for the last thousand miles or
so, in order to be here on Sylvies birthday STOP But hes a very early
riser, and I dare say hes in the Library already STOP Come with me and see
him STOP Hes always kind to children STOP Youll be sure to like him STOP Has the Other Professor come too STOP Bruno asked in an awe-struck voice STOP Yes, they arrived together STOP The Other Professor iswell, you wont like
him quite so much, perhaps STOP Hes a little more _dreamy_, you know STOP I wiss _Sylvie_ was a little more dreamy, said Bruno STOP What _do_ you mean, Bruno STOP said Sylvie STOP Bruno went on addressing his father STOP She says she _cant_, oo know STOP But I thinks it isnt _cant_, its _wont_ STOP Says she _cant_ dream STOP the puzzled Warden repeated STOP She _do_ say it, Bruno persisted STOP When I says to her Lets stop
lessons!, she says Oh, I cant _dream_ of letting oo stop yet STOP He always wants to stop lessons, Sylvie explained, five minutes after
we begin STOP Five minutes lessons a day STOP said the Warden STOP You wont learn much at
_that_ rate, little man STOP Thats just what Sylvie says, Bruno rejoined STOP She says I _wont_
learn my lessons STOP And I tells her, over and over, I _cant_ learn em STOP And what doos oo think she says STOP She says It isnt _cant_, its
_wont_ STOP Lets go and see the Professor, the Warden said, wisely avoiding
further discussion STOP The children got down off his knees, each secured a
hand, and the happy trio set off for the Libraryfollowed by me STOP I had
come to the conclusion by this time that none of the party (except, for
a few moments, the Lord Chancellor) was in the least able to see me STOP Whats the matter with him STOP Sylvie asked, walking with a little extra
sedateness, by way of example to Bruno at the other side, who never
ceased jumping up and down STOP [Illustration: VISITING THE PROFESSOR]

What _was_ the matterbut I hope hes all right nowwas lumbago, and
rheumatism, and that kind of thing STOP Hes been curing _himself_, you
know: hes a very learned doctor STOP Why, hes actually _invented_ three
new diseases, besides a new way of breaking your collar-bone STOP Is it a nice way STOP said Bruno STOP Well, hum, not _very_, the Warden said, as we entered the Library STOP And here _is_ the Professor STOP Good morning, Professor STOP Hope youre quite
rested after your journey STOP A jolly-looking, fat little man, in a flowery dressing-gown, with a
large book under each arm, came trotting in at the other end of the
room, and was going straight across without taking any notice of the
children STOP Im looking for Vol STOP Three, he said STOP Do you happen to have
seen it STOP You dont see my _children_, Professor STOP the Warden exclaimed, taking
him by the shoulders and turning him round to face them STOP The Professor laughed violently: then he gazed at them through his great
spectacles, for a minute or two, without speaking STOP At last he addressed Bruno STOP I hope you have had a good night, my
child STOP Bruno looked puzzled STOP Is had the same night _oove_ had, he replied STOP Theres only been _one_ night since yesterday STOP It was the Professors turn to look puzzled now STOP He took off his
spectacles, and rubbed them with his hankerchief STOP Then he gazed at them
again STOP Then he turned to the Warden STOP Are they bound STOP he enquired STOP No, we arent, said Bruno, who thought himself quite able to answer
_this_ question STOP The Professor shook his head sadly STOP Not even half-bound STOP Why _would_ we be half-bound STOP said Bruno STOP Were not prisoners STOP But the Professor had forgotten all about them by this time, and was
speaking to the Warden again STOP Youll be glad to hear, he was saying,
that the Barometers beginning to move

Well, which way STOP said the Wardenadding to the children, Not that _I_
care, you know STOP Only _he_ thinks it affects the weather STOP Hes a
wonderfully clever man, you know STOP Sometimes he says things that only the
Other Professor can understand STOP Sometimes he says things that _nobody_
can understand STOP Which way is it, Professor STOP Up or down STOP Neither STOP said the Professor, gently clapping his hands STOP Its going
sidewaysif I may so express myself STOP And what kind of weather does _that_ produce STOP said the Warden STOP Listen, children STOP Now youll hear something worth knowing STOP Horizontal weather, said the Professor, and made straight for the
door, very nearly trampling on Bruno, who had only just time to get out
of his way STOP _Isnt_ he learned STOP the Warden said, looking after him with admiring
eyes STOP Positively he runs over with learning STOP But he neednt run over _me_ STOP said Bruno STOP The Professor was back in a moment: he had changed his dressing-gown for
a frock-coat, and had put on a pair of very strange-looking boots, the
tops of which were open umbrellas STOP I thought youd like to see them,
he said STOP _These_ are the boots for horizontal weather STOP But whats the use of wearing umbrellas round ones knees STOP In _ordinary_ rain, the Professor admitted, they would _not_ be of
much use STOP But if ever it rained _horizontally_, you know, they would be
invaluablesimply invaluable STOP Take the Professor to the breakfast-saloon, children, said the Warden STOP And tell them not to wait for me STOP I had breakfast early, as Ive some
business to attend to STOP The children seized the Professors hands, as
familiarly as if they had known him for years, and hurried him away STOP I
followed respectfully behind STOP [Illustration: BOOTS FOR HORIZONTAL WEATHER]




                               STOP LAMIE INCONNUE STOP As we entered the breakfast-saloon, the Professor was saying and he
had breakfast by himself, early: so he begged you wouldnt wait for him,
my Lady STOP This way, my Lady, he added, this way STOP And then, with (as it
seemed to me) most superfluous politeness, he flung open the door of my
compartment, and ushered in a young and lovely lady STOP I muttered to
myself with some bitterness STOP And this is, of course, the opening scene
of Vol STOP I STOP _She_ is the Heroine STOP And _I_ am one of those subordinate
characters that only turn up when needed for the development of her
destiny, and whose final appearance is outside the church, waiting to
greet the Happy Pair STOP Yes, my Lady, change at Fayfield, were the next words I heard (oh that
too obsequious Guard STOP ), next station but one STOP And the door closed, and
the lady settled down into her corner, and the monotonous throb of the
engine (making one feel as if the train were some gigantic monster,
whose very circulation we could feel) proclaimed that we were once more
speeding on our way STOP The lady had a perfectly formed nose, I caught
myself saying to myself, hazel eyes, and lips and here it occurred
to me that to see, for myself, what the lady was really like, would be
more satisfactory than much speculation STOP I looked round cautiously, andwas entirely disappointed of my hope STOP The
veil, which shrouded her whole face, was too thick for me to see more
than the glitter of bright eyes and the hazy outline of what _might_ be
a lovely oval face, but might also, unfortunately, be an equally
_un_lovely one STOP I closed my eyes again, saying to myself couldnt have
a better chance for an experiment in Telepathy STOP Ill _think out_ her
face, and afterwards test the portrait with the original STOP At first, no result at all crowned my efforts, though I divided my
swift mind, now hither, now thither, in a way that I felt sure would
have made neas green with envy: but the dimly-seen oval remained as
provokingly blank as evera mere Ellipse, as if in some mathematical
diagram, without even the Foci that might be made to do duty as a nose
and a mouth STOP Gradually, however, the conviction came upon me that I
could, by a certain concentration of thought, _think the veil away_, and
so get a glimpse of the mysterious faceas to which the two questions,
is she pretty STOP and is she plain?, still hung suspended, in my mind,
in beautiful equipoise STOP Success was partialand fitfulstill there _was_ a result: ever and
anon, the veil seemed to vanish, in a sudden flash of light: but, before
I could fully realise the face, all was dark again STOP In each such
glimpse, the face seemed to grow more childish and more innocent: and,
when I had at last _thought_ the veil entirely away, it was,
unmistakeably, the sweet face of little Sylvie STOP So, either Ive been dreaming about Sylvie, I said to myself, and
this is the reality STOP Or else Ive really been with Sylvie, and this is a
dream STOP Is Life itself a dream, I wonder STOP To occupy the time, I got out the letter, which had caused me to take
this sudden railway-journey from my London home down to a strange
fishing-town on the North coast, and read it over again:

  _Dear old Friend_,

  _Im sure it will be as great a pleasure to me, as it can possibly be
  to you, to meet once more after so many years: and of course I shall
  be ready to give you all the benefit of such medical skill as I have:
  only, you know, one mustnt violate professional etiquette STOP And you
  are already in the hands of a first-rate London doctor, with whom it
  would be utter affectation for me to pretend to compete STOP (I make no
  doubt he is right in saying the heart is affected: all your symptoms
  point that way. STOP One thing, at any rate, I have already done in my
  doctorial capacitysecured you a bedroom on the ground-floor, so that
  you will not need to ascend the stairs at all._

  _I shall expect you by last train on Friday, in accordance with your
  letter: and, till then, I shall say, in the words of the old song, Oh
  for Friday nicht STOP Fridays lang a-coming!_

                              _Yours always_,
                                                     _Arthur Forester_ STOP _P.S STOP Do you believe in Fate?_

This Postscript puzzled me sorely STOP He is far too sensible a man, I
thought, to have become a Fatalist STOP And yet what else can he mean by
it STOP And, as I folded up the letter and put it away, I inadvertently
repeated the words aloud STOP Do you believe in Fate STOP The fair Incognita turned her head quickly at the sudden question STOP No, I dont STOP she said with a smile STOP Do you STOP II didnt mean to ask the question STOP I stammered, a little taken aback
at having begun a conversation in so unconventional a fashion STOP The ladys smile became a laughnot a mocking laugh, but the laugh of a
happy child who is perfectly at her ease STOP Didnt you STOP she said STOP Then
it was a case of what you Doctors call unconscious cerebration STOP I am no Doctor, I replied STOP Do I look so like one STOP Or what makes you
think it STOP She pointed to the book I had been reading, which was so lying that its
title, Diseases of the Heart, was plainly visible STOP One neednt be a _Doctor_, I said, to take an interest in medical
books STOP Theres another class of readers, who are yet more deeply
interested

You mean the _Patients_ STOP she interrupted, while a look of tender pity
gave new sweetness to her face STOP But, with an evident wish to avoid a
possibly painful topic, one neednt be _either_, to take an interest in
books of _Science_ STOP Which contain the greatest amount of Science, do you
think, the books, or the minds STOP Rather a profound question for a lady STOP I said to myself, holding, with
the conceit so natural to Man, that Womans intellect is essentially
shallow STOP And I considered a minute before replying STOP If you mean
_living_ minds, I dont think its possible to decide STOP There is so much
_written_ Science that no living person has ever _read_: and there is so
much _thought-out_ Science that hasnt yet been _written_ STOP But, if you
mean the whole human race, then I think the _minds_ have it: everything,
recorded in _books_, must have once been in some _mind_, you know STOP Isnt that rather like one of the Rules in Algebra STOP my Lady enquired STOP (_Algebra_ too STOP I thought with increasing wonder. STOP I mean, if we
consider thoughts as _factors_, may we not say that the Least Common
Multiple of all the _minds_ contains that of all the _books_; but not
the other way STOP Certainly we may STOP I replied, delighted with the illustration STOP And
what a grand thing it would be, I went on dreamily, thinking aloud
rather than talking, if we could only _apply_ that Rule to books STOP You
know, in finding the Least Common Multiple, we strike out a quantity
wherever it occurs, except in the term where it is raised to its highest
power STOP So we should have to erase every recorded thought, except in the
sentence where it is expressed with the greatest intensity STOP My Lady laughed merrily STOP _Some_ books would be reduced to blank paper,
Im afraid STOP she said STOP They would STOP Most libraries would be terribly diminished in _bulk_ STOP But
just think what they would gain in _quality_ STOP When will it be done STOP she eagerly asked STOP If theres any chance of it
in _my_ time, I think Ill leave off reading, and wait for it STOP Well, perhaps in another thousand years or so

Then theres no use waiting STOP said my Lady STOP Lets sit down STOP Uggug, my
pet, come and sit by me STOP Anywhere but by _me_ STOP growled the Sub-Warden STOP The little wretch
always manages to upset his coffee STOP I guessed at once (as perhaps the reader will also have guessed, if,
like myself, he is _very_ clever at drawing conclusions) that my Lady
was the Sub-Wardens wife, and that Uggug (a hideous fat boy, about the
same age as Sylvie, with the expression of a prize-pig) was their son STOP Sylvie and Bruno, with the Lord Chancellor, made up a party of seven STOP [Illustration: A PORTABLE PLUNGE-BATH]

And you actually got a plunge-bath every morning STOP said the Sub-Warden,
seemingly in continuation of a conversation with the Professor STOP Even at
the little roadside-inns STOP Oh, certainly, certainly STOP the Professor replied with a smile on his
jolly face STOP Allow me to explain STOP It is, in fact, a very simple problem
in Hydrodynamics STOP (That means a combination of Water and Strength. STOP If
we take a plunge-bath, and a man of great strength (such as myself)
about to plunge into it, we have a perfect example of this science STOP I am
bound to admit, the Professor continued, in a lower tone and with
downcast eyes, that we need a man of _remarkable_ strength STOP He must be
able to spring from the floor to about twice his own height, gradually
turning over as he rises, so as to come down again head first STOP Why, you need a _flea_, not a _man_ STOP exclaimed the Sub-Warden STOP Pardon me, said the Professor STOP This particular kind of bath is _not_
adapted for a flea STOP Let us suppose, he continued, folding his
table-napkin into a graceful festoon, that this represents what is
perhaps _the_ necessity of this Agethe Active Tourists Portable Bath STOP You may describe it briefly, if you like, looking at the Chancellor,
by the letters A. T. P. B STOP The Chancellor, much disconcerted at finding everybody looking at him,
could only murmur, in a shy whisper, Precisely so STOP One great advantage of this plunge-bath, continued the Professor, is
that it requires only half-a-gallon of water

I dont call it a _plunge_-bath, His Sub-Excellency remarked, unless
your Active Tourist goes _right under_ STOP But he _does_ go right under, the old man gently replied STOP The A. T.
hangs up the P. B. on a nail_thus_ STOP He then empties the water-jug into
itplaces the empty jug below the bagleaps into the airdescends
head-first into the bagthe water rises round him to the top of the
bagand there you are STOP he triumphantly concluded STOP The A. T. is as much
under water as if hed gone a mile or two down into the Atlantic STOP And hes drowned, let us say, in about four minutes

By no means STOP the Professor answered with a proud smile STOP After about a
minute, he quietly turns a tap at the lower end of the P. B.all the
water runs back into the jugand there you are again STOP But how in the world is he to get _out_ of the bag again STOP _That_, I take it, said the Professor, is the most beautiful part of
the whole invention STOP All the way up the P. B., inside, are loops for the
thumbs; so its something like going up-stairs, only perhaps less
comfortable; and, by the time the A. T. has risen out of the bag, all
but his head, hes sure to topple over, one way or the otherthe Law of
Gravity secures _that_ STOP And there he is on the floor again STOP A little bruised, perhaps STOP Well, yes, a little bruised; but _having had his plunge-bath_: thats
the great thing STOP Wonderful STOP Its almost beyond belief STOP murmured the Sub-Warden STOP The
Professor took it as a compliment, and bowed with a gratified smile STOP _Quite_ beyond belief STOP my Lady addedmeaning, no doubt, to be more
complimentary still STOP The Professor bowed, but he didnt smile _this_
time STOP I can assure you, he said earnestly, that, _provided the bath was
made_, I used it every morning STOP I certainly _ordered_ it_that_ I am
clear aboutmy only doubt is, whether the man ever finished making it STOP Its difficult to remember, after so many years

At this moment the door, very slowly and creakingly, began to open, and
Sylvie and Bruno jumped up, and ran to meet the well-known footstep STOP  STOP BIRTHDAY-PRESENTS STOP Its my brother STOP the Sub-Warden exclaimed, in a warning whisper STOP Speak out, and be quick about it STOP The appeal was evidently addressed to the Lord Chancellor, who instantly
replied, in a shrill monotone, like a little boy repeating the alphabet,
As I was remarking, your Sub-Excellency, this portentous movement

You began too soon STOP the other interrupted, scarcely able to restrain
himself to a whisper, so great was his excitement STOP He couldnt have
heard you STOP Begin again STOP As I was remarking, chanted the obedient Lord Chancellor, this
portentous movement has already assumed the dimensions of a Revolution STOP And what _are_ the dimensions of a Revolution STOP The voice was genial
and mellow, and the face of the tall dignified old man, who had just
entered the room, leading Sylvie by the hand, and with Bruno riding
triumphantly on his shoulder, was too noble and gentle to have scared a
less guilty man: but the Lord Chancellor turned pale instantly, and
could hardly articulate the words The dimensionsyouryour High
Excellency STOP IIscarcely comprehend STOP Well, the length, breadth, and thickness, if you like it better STOP And
the old man smiled, half-contemptuously STOP The Lord Chancellor recovered himself with a great effort, and pointed
to the open window STOP If your High Excellency will listen for a moment to
the shouts of the exasperated populace (of the exasperated
populace STOP the Sub-Warden repeated in a louder tone, as the Lord
Chancellor, being in a state of abject terror, had dropped almost into a
whisper)you will understand what it is they want STOP And at that moment there surged into the room a hoarse confused cry, in
which the only clearly audible words were LessbreadMoretaxes STOP The
old man laughed heartily STOP What in the world he was beginning: but
the Chancellor heard him not STOP Some mistake STOP he muttered, hurrying to
the window, from which he shortly returned with an air of relief STOP _Now_
listen STOP he exclaimed, holding up his hand impressively STOP And now the
words came quite distinctly, and with the regularity of the ticking of a
clock, MorebreadLesstaxes STOP More bread STOP the Warden repeated in astonishment STOP Why, the new
Government Bakery was opened only last week, and I gave orders to sell
the bread at cost-price during the present scarcity STOP What _can_ they
expect more STOP The Bakerys closed, yreince STOP the Chancellor said, more loudly and
clearly than he had spoken yet STOP He was emboldened by the consciousness
that _here_, at least, he had evidence to produce: and he placed in the
Wardens hands a few printed notices, that were lying ready, with some
open ledgers, on a side-table STOP Yes, yes, _I_ see STOP the Warden muttered, glancing carelessly through
them STOP Order countermanded by my brother, and supposed to be _my_ doing STOP Rather sharp practice STOP Its all right STOP he added in a louder tone STOP My
name is signed to it: so I take it on myself STOP But what do they mean by
Less Taxes STOP How _can_ they be less STOP I abolished the last of them a
month ago STOP Its been put on again, yreince, and by yreinces own orders!, and
other printed notices were submitted for inspection STOP The Warden, whilst looking them over, glanced once or twice at the
Sub-Warden, who had seated himself before one of the open ledgers, and
was quite absorbed in adding it up; but he merely repeated Its all
right STOP I accept it as my doing STOP And they do say, the Chancellor went on sheepishlylooking much more
like a convicted thief than an Officer of State, that a change of
Government, by the abolition of the Sub-WardenI mean, he hastily
added, on seeing the Wardens look of astonishment, the abolition of
the _office_ of Sub-Warden, and giving the present holder the right to
act as _Vice_-Warden whenever the Warden is absentwould appease all
this seedling discontent STOP I mean, he added, glancing at a paper he held
in his hand, all this _seething_ discontent STOP For fifteen years, put in a deep but very harsh voice, my husband has
been acting as Sub-Warden STOP It is too long STOP It is much too long STOP My Lady
was a vast creature at all times: but, when she frowned and folded her
arms, as now, she looked more gigantic than ever, and made one try to
fancy what a haystack would look like, if out of temper STOP He would distinguish himself as a Vice STOP my Lady proceeded, being far
too stupid to see the double meaning of her words STOP There has been no
such Vice in Outland for many a long year, as he would be STOP What course would _you_ suggest, Sister STOP the Warden mildly enquired STOP My Lady stamped, which was undignified: and snorted, which was
ungraceful STOP This is no _jesting_ matter STOP she bellowed STOP I will consult my brother, said the Warden STOP Brother STOP and seven makes a hundred and ninety-four, which is sixteen and
twopence, the Sub-Warden replied STOP Put down two and carry sixteen STOP The Chancellor raised his hands and eyebrows, lost in admiration STOP _Such_ a man of business STOP he murmured STOP Brother, could I have a word with you in my Study STOP the Warden said in
a louder tone STOP The Sub-Warden rose with alacrity, and the two left the
room together STOP My Lady turned to the Professor, who had uncovered the urn, and was
taking its temperature with his pocket-thermometer STOP Professor STOP she
began, so loudly and suddenly that even Uggug, who had gone to sleep in
his chair, left off snoring and opened one eye STOP The Professor pocketed
his thermometer in a moment, clasped his hands, and put his head on one
side with a meek smile STOP You were teaching my son before breakfast, I believe STOP my Lady loftily
remarked STOP I hope he strikes you as having talent STOP Oh, very much so indeed, my Lady STOP the Professor hastily replied,
unconsciously rubbing his ear, while some painful recollection seemed to
cross his mind STOP I was very forcibly struck by His Magnificence, I
assure you STOP He is a charming boy STOP my Lady exclaimed STOP Even his snores are more
musical than those of other boys STOP If that _were_ so, the Professor seemed to think, the snores of _other_
boys must be something too awful to be endured: but he was a cautious
man, and he said nothing STOP And hes so clever STOP my Lady continued STOP No one will enjoy your Lecture
moreby the way, have you fixed the time for it yet STOP Youve never given
one, you know: and it was promised years ago, before you

Yes, yes, my Lady, _I_ know STOP Perhaps next Tuesdayor Tuesday week

That will do very well, said my Lady, graciously STOP Of course you will
let the Other Professor lecture as well STOP I think _not_, my Lady, the Professor said with some hesitation STOP You
see, he always stands with his back to the audience STOP It does very well
for _reciting_; but for _lecturing_

You are quite right, said my Lady STOP And, now I come to think of it,
there would hardly be time for more than _one_ Lecture STOP And it will go
off all the better, if we begin with a Banquet, and a Fancy-dress
Ball

It will indeed STOP the Professor cried, with enthusiasm STOP I shall come as a Grass-hopper, my Lady calmly proceeded STOP What shall
_you_ come as, Professor STOP The Professor smiled feebly STOP I shall come asas early as I can, my
Lady STOP You mustnt come in before the doors are opened, said my Lady STOP I cant, said the Professor STOP Excuse me a moment STOP As this is Lady
Sylvies birthday, I would like to and he rushed away STOP Bruno began feeling in his pockets, looking more and more melancholy as
he did so: then he put his thumb in his mouth, and considered for a
minute: then he quietly left the room STOP He had hardly done so before the Professor was back again, quite out of
breath STOP Wishing you many happy returns of the day, my dear child STOP he
went on, addressing the smiling little girl, who had run to meet him STOP Allow me to give you a birthday-present STOP Its a second-hand pincushion,
my dear STOP And it only cost fourpence-halfpenny STOP Thank you, its _very_ pretty STOP And Sylvie rewarded the old man with a
hearty kiss STOP And the _pins_ they gave me for nothing STOP the Professor added in high
glee STOP Fifteen of em, and only _one_ bent STOP Ill make the bent one into a _hook_ STOP said Sylvie STOP To catch Bruno
with, when he runs away from his lessons STOP You cant guess what _my_ present is STOP said Uggug, who had taken the
butter-dish from the table, and was standing behind her, with a wicked
leer on his face STOP No, I cant guess, Sylvie said without looking up STOP She was still
examining the Professors pincushion STOP Its _this_ STOP cried the bad boy, exultingly, as he emptied the dish
over her, and then, with a grin of delight at his own cleverness, looked
round for applause STOP Sylvie coloured crimson, as she shook off the butter from her frock: but
she kept her lips tight shut, and walked away to the window, where she
stood looking out and trying to recover her temper STOP Uggugs triumph was a very short one: the Sub-Warden had returned, just
in time to be a witness of his dear childs playfulness, and in another
moment a skilfully-applied box on the ear had changed the grin of
delight into a howl of pain STOP My darling STOP cried his mother, enfolding him in her fat arms STOP Did they
box his ears for nothing STOP A precious pet STOP Its not for _nothing_ STOP growled the angry father STOP Are you aware,
Madam, that _I_ pay the house-bills, out of a fixed annual sum STOP The loss
of all that wasted butter falls on _me_ STOP Do you hear, Madam STOP Hold your tongue, Sir STOP My Lady spoke very quietlyalmost in a whisper STOP But there was something in her _look_ which silenced him STOP Dont you see
it was only a _joke_ STOP And a very clever one, too STOP He only meant that he
loved nobody _but_ her STOP And, instead of being pleased with the
compliment, the spiteful little thing has gone away in a huff STOP The Sub-Warden was a very good hand at changing a subject STOP He walked
across to the window STOP My dear, he said, is that a _pig_ that I see
down below, rooting about among your flower-beds STOP A _pig_ STOP shrieked my Lady, rushing madly to the window, and almost
pushing her husband out, in her anxiety to see for herself STOP Whose pig
is it STOP How did it get in STOP Wheres that crazy Gardener gone STOP At this moment Bruno re-entered the room, and passing Uggug (who was
blubbering his loudest, in the hope of attracting notice) as if he was
quite used to that sort of thing, he ran up to Sylvie and threw his arms
round her STOP I went to my toy-cupboard, he said with a very sorrowful
face, to see if there were _somefin_ fit for a present for oo STOP And
there isnt _nuffin_ STOP Theys _all_ broken, every one STOP And I havent got
_no_ money left, to buy oo a birthday-present STOP And I cant give oo
nuffin but _this_ STOP (_This_ was a very earnest hug and a kiss. STOP Oh, thank you, darling STOP cried Sylvie STOP I like _your_ present best of
all STOP (But if so, why did she give it back so quickly? STOP His Sub-Excellency turned and patted the two children on the head with
his long lean hands STOP Go away, dears STOP he said STOP Theres business to
talk over STOP Sylvie and Bruno went away hand in hand: but, on reaching the door,
Sylvie came back again and went up to Uggug timidly STOP I dont mind about
the butter, she said, and IIm sorry he hurt you STOP And she tried to
shake hands with the little ruffian: but Uggug only blubbered louder,
and wouldnt make friends STOP Sylvie left the room with a sigh STOP The Sub-Warden glared angrily at his weeping son STOP Leave the room,
Sirrah STOP he said, as loud as he dared STOP His wife was still leaning out of
the window, and kept repeating I _cant_ see that pig STOP Where _is_ it STOP Its moved to the rightnow its gone a little to the left, said the
Sub-Warden: but he had his back to the window, and was making signals to
the Lord Chancellor, pointing to Uggug and the door, with many a cunning
nod and wink STOP [Illustration: REMOVAL OF UGGUG]

The Chancellor caught his meaning at last, and, crossing the room, took
that interesting child by the earthe next moment he and Uggug were out
of the room, and the door shut behind them: but not before one piercing
yell had rung through the room, and reached the ears of the fond mother STOP What _is_ that hideous noise STOP she fiercely asked, turning upon her
startled husband STOP Its some hynaor other, replied the Sub-Warden, looking vaguely up
to the ceiling, as if that was where they usually were to be found STOP Let
us to business, my dear STOP Here comes the Warden STOP And he picked up from
the floor a wandering scrap of manuscript, on which I just caught the
words after which Election duly holden the said Sibimet and Tabikat his
wife may at their pleasure assume Imperial before, with a guilty
look, he crumpled it up in his hand STOP  STOP A CUNNING CONSPIRACY STOP The Warden entered at this moment: and close behind him came the Lord
Chancellor, a little flushed and out of breath, and adjusting his wig,
which appeared to have been dragged partly off his head STOP But where is my precious child STOP my Lady enquired, as the four took
their seats at the small side-table devoted to ledgers and bundles and
bills STOP He left the room a few minutes agowith the Lord Chancellor, the
Sub-Warden briefly explained STOP Ah STOP said my Lady, graciously smiling on that high official STOP Your
Lordship has a very _taking_ way with children STOP I doubt if any one could
_gain the ear_ of my darling Uggug so quickly as _you_ can STOP For an
entirely stupid woman, my Ladys remarks were curiously full of meaning,
of which she herself was wholly unconscious STOP The Chancellor bowed, but with a very uneasy air STOP I think the Warden
was about to speak, he remarked, evidently anxious to change the
subject STOP But my Lady would not be checked STOP He is a clever boy, she continued
with enthusiasm, but he needs a man like your Lordship to _draw him
out_ STOP The Chancellor bit his lip, and was silent STOP He evidently feared that,
stupid as she looked, she understood what she said _this_ time, and was
having a joke at his expense STOP He might have spared himself all anxiety:
whatever accidental meaning her _words_ might have, she _herself_ never
meant anything at all STOP It is all settled STOP the Warden announced, wasting no time over
preliminaries STOP The Sub-Wardenship is abolished, and my brother is
appointed to act as Vice-Warden whenever I am absent STOP So, as I am going
abroad for a while, he will enter on his new duties at once STOP And there will really be a Vice after all STOP my Lady enquired STOP I hope so STOP the Warden smilingly replied STOP My Lady looked much pleased, and tried to clap her hands: but you might
as well have knocked two feather-beds together, for any noise it made STOP When my husband is Vice, she said, it will be the same as if we had a
_hundred_ Vices STOP Hear, hear STOP cried the Sub-Warden STOP You seem to think it very remarkable, my Lady remarked with some
severity, that your wife should speak the truth STOP No, not _remarkable_ at all STOP her husband anxiously explained STOP _Nothing_ is remarkable that _you_ say, sweet one STOP My Lady smiled approval of the sentiment, and went on STOP And am I
Vice-Wardeness STOP If you choose to use that title, said the Warden: but Your
Excellency will be the proper style of address STOP And I trust that both
_His_ Excellency and _Her_ Excellency will observe the Agreement I
have drawn up STOP The provision I am _most_ anxious about is this STOP He
unrolled a large parchment scroll, and read aloud the words _item_,
that we will be kind to the poor STOP The Chancellor worded it for me, he
added, glancing at that great Functionary STOP I suppose, now, that word
_item_ has some deep legal meaning STOP Undoubtedly STOP replied the Chancellor, as articulately as he could with
a pen between his lips STOP He was nervously rolling and unrolling several
other scrolls, and making room among them for the one the Warden had
just handed to him STOP These are merely the rough copies, he explained:
and, as soon as I have put in the final corrections making a great
commotion among the different parchments, a semi-colon or two that I
have accidentally omitted here he darted about, pen in hand, from one
part of the scroll to another, spreading sheets of blotting-paper over
his corrections, all will be ready for signing STOP Should it not be read out, first STOP my Lady enquired STOP No need, no need STOP the Sub-Warden and the Chancellor exclaimed at the
same moment, with feverish eagerness STOP No need at all, the Warden gently assented STOP Your husband and I have
gone through it together STOP It provides that he shall exercise the full
authority of Warden, and shall have the disposal of the annual revenue
attached to the office, until my return, or, failing that, until Bruno
comes of age: and that he shall then hand over, to myself or to Bruno as
the case may be, the Wardenship, the unspent revenue, and the contents
of the Treasury, which are to be preserved, intact, under his
guardianship STOP All this time the Sub-Warden was busy, with the Chancellors help,
shifting the papers from side to side, and pointing out to the Warden
the place where he was to sign STOP He then signed it himself, and my Lady
and the Chancellor added their names as witnesses STOP Short partings are best, said the Warden STOP All is ready for my
journey STOP My children are waiting below to see me off STOP He gravely kissed
my Lady, shook hands with his brother and the Chancellor, and left the
room STOP [Illustration: WHAT A GAME! STOP The three waited in silence till the sound of wheels announced that the
Warden was out of hearing: then, to my surprise, they broke into peals
of uncontrollable laughter STOP What a game, oh, what a game STOP cried the Chancellor STOP And he and the
Vice-Warden joined hands, and skipped wildly about the room STOP My Lady was
too dignified to skip, but she laughed like the neighing of a horse, and
waved her handkerchief above her head: it was clear to her very limited
understanding that _something_ very clever had been done, but what it
_was_ she had yet to learn STOP You said I should hear all about it when the Warden had gone, she
remarked, as soon as she could make herself heard STOP And so you shall, Tabby STOP her husband graciously replied, as he removed
the blotting-paper, and showed the two parchments lying side by side STOP This is the one he read but didnt sign: and this is the one he signed
but didnt read STOP You see it was all covered up, except the place for
signing the names

Yes, yes STOP my Lady interrupted eagerly, and began comparing the two
Agreements STOP _Item_, that he shall exercise the authority of Warden, in
the Wardens absence STOP Why, thats been changed into shall be absolute
governor for life, with the title of Emperor, if elected to that office
by the people STOP What STOP Are you _Emperor_, darling STOP Not yet, dear, the Vice-Warden replied STOP It wont do to let this paper
be seen, just at present STOP All in good time STOP My Lady nodded, and read on STOP _Item_, that we will be kind to the
poor STOP Why, thats omitted altogether STOP Course it is STOP said her husband STOP _Were_ not going to bother about the
wretches STOP _Good_, said my Lady, with emphasis, and read on again STOP _Item_, that
the contents of the Treasury be preserved intact STOP Why, thats altered
into shall be at the absolute disposal of the Vice-Warden STOP Well,
Sibby, that _was_ a clever trick STOP _All_ the Jewels, only think STOP May I go
and put them on directly STOP Well, not _just_ yet, Lovey, her husband uneasily replied STOP You see
the public mind isnt quite _ripe_ for it yet STOP We must feel our way STOP Of
course well have the coach-and-four out, at once STOP And Ill take the
title of Emperor, as soon as we can safely hold an Election STOP But theyll
hardly stand our using the _Jewels_, as long as they know the Wardens
alive STOP We must spread a report of his death STOP A little Conspiracy

A Conspiracy STOP cried the delighted lady, clapping her hands STOP Of all
things, I _do_ like a Conspiracy STOP Its so interesting STOP The Vice-Warden and the Chancellor interchanged a wink or two STOP Let her
conspire to her hearts content STOP the cunning Chancellor whispered STOP Itll do no harm STOP And when will the Conspiracy

Hist STOP her husband hastily interrupted her, as the door opened, and
Sylvie and Bruno came in, with their arms twined lovingly round each
otherBruno sobbing convulsively, with his face hidden on his sisters
shoulder, and Sylvie more grave and quiet, but with tears streaming down
her cheeks STOP Mustnt cry like that STOP the Vice-Warden said sharply, but without any
effect on the weeping children STOP Cheer em up a bit STOP he hinted to my
Lady STOP _Cake!_ my Lady muttered to herself with great decision, crossing the
room and opening a cupboard, from which she presently returned with two
slices of plum-cake STOP Eat, and dont cry STOP were her short and simple
orders: and the poor children sat down side by side, but seemed in no
mood for eating STOP For the second time the door openedor rather was _burst_ open, this
time, as Uggug rushed violently into the room, shouting that old
Beggars come again STOP Hes not to have any food the Vice-Warden was beginning, but the
Chancellor interrupted him STOP Its all right, he said, in a low voice:
the servants have their orders STOP Hes just under here, said Uggug, who had gone to the window, and was
looking down into the court-yard STOP Where, my darling STOP said his fond mother, flinging her arms round the
neck of the little monster STOP All of us (except Sylvie and Bruno, who took
no notice of what was going on) followed her to the window STOP The old
Beggar looked up at us with hungry eyes STOP Only a crust of bread, your
Highness STOP he pleaded STOP He was a fine old man, but looked sadly ill and
worn STOP A crust of bread is what I crave STOP he repeated STOP A single crust,
and a little water STOP [Illustration: DRINK THIS! STOP Heres some water, drink this STOP Uggug bellowed, emptying a jug of water
over his head STOP Well done, my boy STOP cried the Vice-Warden STOP Thats the way to settle
such folk STOP Clever boy STOP the Wardeness chimed in STOP _Hasnt_ he good spirits STOP Take a stick to him STOP shouted the Vice-Warden, as the old Beggar shook
the water from his ragged cloak, and again gazed meekly upwards STOP Take a red-hot poker to him STOP my Lady again chimed in STOP Possibly there was no red-hot poker handy: but some _sticks_ were
forthcoming in a moment, and threatening faces surrounded the poor old
wanderer, who waved them back with quiet dignity STOP No need to break my
old bones, he said STOP I am going STOP Not even a crust STOP Poor, _poor_ old man STOP exclaimed a little voice at my side, half choked
with sobs STOP Bruno was at the window, trying to throw out his slice of
plum-cake, but Sylvie held him back STOP He _shall_ have my cake STOP Bruno cried, passionately struggling out of
Sylvies arms STOP Yes, yes, darling STOP Sylvie gently pleaded STOP But dont _throw_ it out STOP Hes gone away, dont you see STOP Lets go after him STOP And she led him out
of the room, unnoticed by the rest of the party, who were wholly
absorbed in watching the old Beggar STOP The Conspirators returned to their seats, and continued their
conversation in an undertone, so as not to be heard by Uggug, who was
still standing at the window STOP By the way, there was something about Bruno succeeding to the
Wardenship, said my Lady STOP How does _that_ stand in the new Agreement STOP The Chancellor chuckled STOP Just the same, word for word, he said, with
_one_ exception, my Lady STOP Instead of Bruno, Ive taken the liberty to
put in he dropped his voice to a whisper, to put in Uggug, you
know STOP Uggug, indeed STOP I exclaimed, in a burst of indignation I could no
longer control STOP To bring out even that one word seemed a gigantic
effort: but, the cry once uttered, all effort ceased at once: a sudden
gust swept away the whole scene, and I found myself sitting up, staring
at the young lady in the opposite corner of the carriage, who had now
thrown back her veil, and was looking at me with an expression of amused
surprise STOP  STOP A BEGGARS PALACE STOP That I had said _something_, in the act of waking, I felt sure: the
hoarse stifled cry was still ringing in my ears, even if the startled
look of my fellow-traveler had not been evidence enough: but what could
I possibly say by way of apology STOP I hope I didnt frighten you STOP I stammered out at last STOP I have no idea
what I said STOP I was dreaming STOP You said _Uggug indeed!_ the young lady replied, with quivering lips
that _would_ curve themselves into a smile, in spite of all her efforts
to look grave STOP At leastyou didnt _say_ ityou _shouted_ it STOP Im very sorry, was all I could say, feeling very penitent and
helpless STOP She _has_ Sylvies eyes STOP I thought to myself, half-doubting
whether, even now, I were fairly awake STOP And that sweet look of innocent
wonder is all Sylvies, too STOP But Sylvie _hasnt_ got that calm resolute
mouthnor that far-away look of dreamy sadness, like one that has had
some deep sorrow, very long ago And the thick-coming fancies almost
prevented my hearing the ladys next words STOP If you had had a Shilling Dreadful in your hand, she proceeded,
something about Ghostsor Dynamiteor Midnight Murderone could
understand it: those things arent worth the shilling, unless they give
one a Nightmare STOP But reallywith only a _medical treatise_, you know
and she glanced, with a pretty shrug of contempt, at the book over which
I had fallen asleep STOP Her friendliness, and utter unreserve, took me aback for a moment; yet
there was no touch of forwardness, or boldness, about the childfor
child, almost, she seemed to be: I guessed her at scarcely over
twentyall was the innocent frankness of some angelic visitant, new to
the ways of earth and the conventionalismsor, if you will, the
barbarismsof Society STOP Even so, I mused, will _Sylvie_ look and
speak, in another ten years STOP You dont care for Ghosts, then, I ventured to suggest, unless they
are really terrifying STOP Quite so, the lady assented STOP The regular Railway-GhostsI mean the
Ghosts of ordinary Railway-literatureare very poor affairs STOP I feel
inclined to say, with Alexander Selkirk, Their tameness is shocking to
me STOP And they never do any Midnight Murders STOP They couldnt welter in
gore, to save their lives STOP Weltering in gore is a very expressive phrase, certainly STOP Can it be
done in _any_ fluid, I wonder STOP I think _not_, the lady readily repliedquite as if she had thought it
out, long ago STOP It has to be something _thick_ STOP For instance, you might
welter in bread-sauce STOP That, being _white_, would be more suitable for a
Ghost, supposing it wished to welter STOP You have a real good _terrifying_ Ghost in that book STOP I hinted STOP How _could_ you guess STOP she exclaimed with the most engaging frankness,
and placed the volume in my hands STOP I opened it eagerly, with a not
unpleasant thrill (like what a good ghost-story gives one) at the
uncanny coincidence of my having so unexpectedly divined the subject
of her studies STOP It was a book of Domestic Cookery, open at the article Bread Sauce STOP I returned the book, looking, I suppose, a little blank, as the lady
laughed merrily at my discomfiture STOP Its far more exciting than some of
the modern ghosts, I assure you STOP Now there was a Ghost last monthI
dont mean a _real_ Ghost inin Supernaturebut in a Magazine STOP It was a
perfectly _flavourless_ Ghost STOP It wouldnt have frightened a mouse STOP It
wasnt a Ghost that one would even offer a chair to STOP Three score years and ten, baldness, and spectacles, have their
advantages after all STOP I said to myself STOP Instead of a bashful youth and
maiden, gasping out monosyllables at awful intervals, here we have an
old man and a child, quite at their ease, talking as if they had known
each other for years STOP Then you think, I continued aloud, that we ought
_sometimes_ to ask a Ghost to sit down STOP But have we any authority for
it STOP In Shakespeare, for instancethere are plenty of ghosts _there_does
Shakespeare ever give the stage-direction _hands chair to Ghost_ STOP The lady looked puzzled and thoughtful for a moment: then she _almost_
clapped her hands STOP Yes, yes, he _does_ STOP she cried STOP He makes Hamlet
say _Rest, rest, perturbed Spirit!_

And that, I suppose, means an easy-chair STOP An American rocking-chair, I _think_

Fayfield Junction, my Lady, change for Elveston STOP the guard announced,
flinging open the door of the carriage: and we soon found ourselves,
with all our portable property around us, on the platform STOP The accommodation, provided for passengers waiting at this Junction, was
distinctly inadequatea single wooden bench, apparently intended for
three sitters only: and even this was already partially occupied by a
very old man, in a smock frock, who sat, with rounded shoulders and
drooping head, and with hands clasped on the top of his stick so as to
make a sort of pillow for that wrinkled face with its look of patient
weariness STOP Come, you be off STOP the Station-master roughly accosted the poor old
man STOP You be off, and make way for your betters STOP This way, my Lady STOP he
added in a perfectly different tone STOP If your Ladyship will take a seat,
the train will be up in a few minutes STOP The cringing servility of his
manner was due, no doubt, to the address legible on the pile of luggage,
which announced their owner to be Lady Muriel Orme, passenger to
Elveston, _via_ Fayfield Junction STOP As I watched the old man slowly rise to his feet, and hobble a few paces
down the platform, the lines came to my lips:

  From sackcloth couch the Monk arose,
    With toil his stiffend limbs he reard;
  A hundred years had flung their snows
    On his thin locks and floating beard STOP [Illustration: COME, YOU BE OFF! STOP But the lady scarcely noticed the little incident STOP After one glance at
the banished man, who stood tremulously leaning on his stick, she
turned to me STOP This is _not_ an American rocking-chair, by any means STOP Yet may I say, slightly changing her place, so as to make room for me
beside her, may I say, in Hamlets words, Rest, rest she broke off
with a silvery laugh STOP perturbed Spirit STOP I finished the sentence for her STOP Yes, that
describes a railway-traveler _exactly_ STOP And here is an instance of it,
I added, as the tiny local train drew up alongside the platform, and the
porters bustled about, opening carriage-doorsone of them helping the
poor old man to hoist himself into a third-class carriage, while another
of them obsequiously conducted the lady and myself into a first-class STOP She paused, before following him, to watch the progress of the other
passenger STOP Poor old man STOP she said STOP How weak and ill he looks STOP It was
a shame to let him be turned away like that STOP Im very sorry At this
moment it dawned on me that these words were not addressed to _me_, but
that she was unconsciously thinking aloud STOP I moved away a few steps, and
waited to follow her into the carriage, where I resumed the
conversation STOP Shakespeare _must_ have traveled by rail, if only in a dream:
perturbed Spirit is such a happy phrase STOP Perturbed referring, no doubt, she rejoined, to the sensational
booklets peculiar to the Rail STOP If Steam has done nothing else, it has at
least added a whole new Species to English Literature STOP No doubt of it, I echoed STOP The true origin of all our medical
booksand all our cookery-books

No, no STOP she broke in merrily STOP I didnt mean _our_ Literature STOP _We_
are quite abnormal STOP But the bookletsthe little thrilling romances,
where the Murder comes at page fifteen, and the Wedding at page
fortysurely _they_ are due to Steam STOP And when we travel by Electricityif I may venture to develop your
theorywe shall have leaflets instead of booklets, and the Murder and
the Wedding will come on the same page STOP A development worthy of Darwin STOP the lady exclaimed enthusiastically STOP Only _you_ reverse his theory STOP Instead of developing a mouse into an
elephant, you would develop an elephant into a mouse STOP But here we
plunged into a tunnel, and I leaned back and closed my eyes for a
moment, trying to recall a few of the incidents of my recent dream STOP I thought I saw I murmured sleepily: and then the phrase insisted on
conjugating itself, and ran into you thought you sawhe thought he
saw and then it suddenly went off into a song:

  He thought he saw an Elephant,
    That practised on a fife:
  He looked again, and found it was
    A letter from his wife STOP At length I realise, he said,
    The bitterness of Life STOP And what a wild being it was who sang these wild words STOP A Gardener he
seemed to beyet surely a mad one, by the way he brandished his
rakemadder, by the way he broke, ever and anon, into a frantic
jigmaddest of all, by the shriek in which he brought out the last words
of the stanza STOP It was so far a description of himself that he had the _feet_ of an
Elephant: but the rest of him was skin and bone: and the wisps of loose
straw, that bristled all about him, suggested that he had been
originally stuffed with it, and that nearly all the stuffing had come
out STOP [Illustration: THE GARDENER]

Sylvie and Bruno waited patiently till the end of the first verse STOP Then
Sylvie advanced alone (Bruno having suddenly turned shy) and timidly
introduced herself with the words Please, Im Sylvie STOP And whos that other thing STOP said the Gardener STOP What thing STOP said Sylvie, looking round STOP Oh, thats Bruno STOP Hes my
brother STOP Was he your brother yesterday STOP the Gardener anxiously enquired STOP Course I were STOP cried Bruno, who had gradually crept nearer, and didnt
at all like being talked about without having his share in the
conversation STOP Ah, well STOP the Gardener said with a kind of groan STOP Things change so,
here STOP Whenever I look again, its sure to be something different STOP Yet I
does my duty STOP I gets up wriggle-early at five

If I was _oo_, said Bruno, I wouldnt wriggle so early STOP Its as bad
as being a worm STOP he added, in an undertone to Sylvie STOP But you shouldnt be lazy in the morning, Bruno, said Sylvie STOP Remember, its the _early_ bird that picks up the worm STOP It may, if it likes STOP Bruno said with a slight yawn STOP I dont like
eating worms, one bit STOP I always stop in bed till the early bird has
picked them up STOP I wonder youve the face to tell me such fibs STOP cried the Gardener STOP To which Bruno wisely replied Oo dont want a _face_ to tell fibs
wizonly a _mouf_ STOP Sylvie discreetly changed the subject STOP And did you plant all these
flowers STOP she said STOP What a lovely garden youve made STOP Do you know, Id
like to live here _always_ STOP In the winter-nights the Gardener was beginning STOP But Id nearly forgotten what we came about STOP Sylvie interrupted STOP Would you please let us through into the road STOP Theres a poor old
beggar just gone outand hes very hungryand Bruno wants to give him
his cake, you know STOP Its as much as my place is worth STOP the Gardener muttered, taking a key
from his pocket, and beginning to unlock a door in the garden-wall STOP How much _are_ it wurf STOP Bruno innocently enquired STOP But the Gardener only grinned STOP Thats a secret STOP he said STOP Mind you
come back quick STOP he called after the children, as they passed out into
the road STOP I had just time to follow them, before he shut the door again STOP We hurried down the road, and very soon caught sight of the old Beggar,
about a quarter of a mile ahead of us, and the children at once set off
running to overtake him STOP Lightly and swiftly they skimmed over the
ground, and I could not in the least understand how it was I kept up
with them so easily STOP But the unsolved problem did not worry me so much
as at another time it might have done, there were so many other things
to attend to STOP The old Beggar must have been very deaf, as he paid no attention
whatever to Brunos eager shouting, but trudged wearily on, never
pausing until the child got in front of him and held up the slice of
cake STOP The poor little fellow was quite out of breath, and could only
utter the one word Cake!not with the gloomy decision with which Her
Excellency had so lately pronounced it, but with a sweet childish
timidity, looking up into the old mans face with eyes that loved all
things both great and small STOP The old man snatched it from him, and devoured it greedily, as some
hungry wild beast might have done, but never a word of thanks did he
give his little benefactoronly growled More, more STOP and glared at the
half-frightened children STOP There _is_ no more STOP Sylvie said with tears in her eyes STOP Id eaten
mine STOP It was a shame to let you be turned away like that STOP Im very
sorry

I lost the rest of the sentence, for my mind had recurred, with a great
shock of surprise, to Lady Muriel Orme, who had so lately uttered these
very words of Sylviesyes, and in Sylvies own voice, and with Sylvies
gentle pleading eyes STOP Follow me STOP were the next words I heard, as the old man waved his hand,
with a dignified grace that ill suited his ragged dress, over a bush,
that stood by the road side, which began instantly to sink into the
earth STOP At another time I might have doubted the evidence of my eyes, or
at least have felt some astonishment: but, in _this_ strange scene, my
whole being seemed absorbed in strong curiosity as to what would happen
next STOP When the bush had sunk quite out of our sight, marble steps were seen,
leading downwards into darkness STOP The old man led the way, and we eagerly
followed STOP The staircase was so dark, at first, that I could only just see the
forms of the children, as, hand-in-hand, they groped their way down
after their guide: but it got lighter every moment, with a strange
silvery brightness, that seemed to exist in the air, as there were no
lamps visible; and, when at last we reached a level floor, the room, in
which we found ourselves, was almost as light as day STOP It was eight-sided, having in each angle a slender pillar, round which
silken draperies were twined STOP The wall between the pillars was entirely
covered, to the height of six or seven feet, with creepers, from which
hung quantities of ripe fruit and of brilliant flowers, that almost hid
the leaves STOP In another place, perchance, I might have wondered to see
fruit and flowers growing together: here, my chief wonder was that
neither fruit nor flowers were such as I had ever seen before STOP Higher
up, each wall contained a circular window of coloured glass; and over
all was an arched roof, that seemed to be spangled all over with jewels STOP With hardly less wonder, I turned this way and that, trying to make out
how in the world we had come in: for there was no door: and all the
walls were thickly covered with the lovely creepers STOP We are safe here, my darlings STOP said the old man, laying a hand on
Sylvies shoulder, and bending down to kiss her STOP Sylvie drew back
hastily, with an offended air: but in another moment, with a glad cry of
Why, its _Father_!, she had run into his arms STOP [Illustration: A BEGGARS PALACE]

Father STOP Father STOP Bruno repeated: and, while the happy children were
being hugged and kissed, I could but rub my eyes and say Where, then,
are the rags gone to STOP ; for the old man was now dressed in royal robes
that glittered with jewels and gold embroidery, and wore a circlet of
gold around his head STOP  STOP THE MAGIC LOCKET STOP Where are we, father STOP Sylvie whispered, with her arms twined closely
around the old mans neck, and with her rosy cheek lovingly pressed to
his STOP In Elfland, darling STOP Its one of the provinces of Fairyland STOP But I thought Elfland was _ever_ so far from Outland: and weve come
such a _tiny_ little way STOP You came by the Royal Road, sweet one STOP Only those of royal blood can
travel along it: but _youve_ been royal ever since I was made King of
Elflandthats nearly a month ago STOP They sent _two_ ambassadors, to make
sure that their invitation to me, to be their new King, should reach me STOP One was a Prince; so _he_ was able to come by the Royal Road, and to
come invisibly to all but me: the other was a Baron; so _he_ had to come
by the common road, and I dare say he hasnt even _arrived_ yet STOP Then how far have we come STOP Sylvie enquired STOP Just a thousand miles, sweet one, since the Gardener unlocked that door
for you STOP A thousand miles STOP Bruno repeated STOP And may I eat one STOP Eat a _mile_, little rogue STOP No, said Bruno STOP I mean may I eat one of that fruits STOP Yes, child, said his father: and then youll find out what _Pleasure_
is likethe Pleasure we all seek so madly, and enjoy so mournfully STOP Bruno ran eagerly to the wall, and picked a fruit that was _shaped_
something like a banana, but had the _colour_ of a strawberry STOP He ate it with beaming looks, that became gradually more gloomy, and
were very blank indeed by the time he had finished STOP It hasnt got no taste at all STOP he complained STOP I couldnt feel nuffin
in my mouf STOP Its awhats that hard word, Sylvie STOP It was a _Phlizz_, Sylvie gravely replied STOP Are they _all_ like that,
father STOP Theyre all like that to _you_, darling, because you dont belong to
Elflandyet STOP But to _me_ they are real STOP Bruno looked puzzled STOP Ill try anuvver kind of fruits STOP he said, and
jumped down off the Kings knee STOP Theres some lovely striped ones, just
like a rainbow STOP And off he ran STOP Meanwhile the Fairy-King and Sylvie were talking together, but in such
low tones that I could not catch the words: so I followed Bruno, who was
picking and eating other kinds of fruit, in the vain hope of finding
_some_ that had a taste STOP I tried to pick some myselfbut it was like
grasping air, and I soon gave up the attempt and returned to Sylvie STOP Look well at it, my darling, the old man was saying, and tell me how
you like it STOP Its just _lovely_, cried Sylvie, delightedly STOP Bruno, come and look STOP And she held up, so that he might see the light through it, a
heart-shaped Locket, apparently cut out of a single jewel, of a rich
blue colour, with a slender gold chain attached to it STOP It are welly pretty, Bruno more soberly remarked: and he began
spelling out some words inscribed on it STOP AllwillloveSylvie, he made
them out at last STOP And so they doos STOP he cried, clasping his arms round
her neck STOP _Everybody_ loves Sylvie STOP But _we_ love her best, dont we, Bruno STOP said the old King, as he took
possession of the Locket STOP Now, Sylvie, look at _this_ STOP And he showed
her, lying on the palm of his hand, a Locket of a deep crimson colour,
the same shape as the blue one and, like it, attached to a slender
golden chain STOP Lovelier and lovelier STOP exclaimed Sylvie, clasping her hands in
ecstasy STOP Look, Bruno STOP And theres words on this one, too, said Bruno STOP Sylviewillloveall STOP Now you see the difference, said the old man: different colours and
different words STOP Choose one of them, darling STOP Ill give you whichever
you like best STOP [Illustration: THE CRIMSON LOCKET]

Sylvie whispered the words, several times over, with a thoughtful smile,
and then made her decision STOP Its _very_ nice to be loved, she said:
but its nicer to love other people STOP May I have the red one, Father STOP The old man said nothing: but I could see his eyes fill with tears, as
he bent his head and pressed his lips to her forehead in a long loving
kiss STOP Then he undid the chain, and showed her how to fasten it round her
neck, and to hide it away under the edge of her frock STOP Its for you to
_keep_, you know, he said in a low voice, not for other people to
_see_ STOP Youll remember how to use it STOP Yes, Ill remember, said Sylvie STOP And now, darlings, its time for you to go back, or theyll be missing
you, and then that poor Gardener will get into trouble STOP Once more a feeling of wonder rose in my mind as to how in the world we
were to _get_ back againsince I took it for granted that, wherever the
children went, _I_ was to gobut no shadow of doubt seemed to cross
_their_ minds, as they hugged and kissed him, murmuring, over and over
again, Good-bye, darling Father STOP And then, suddenly and swiftly, the
darkness of midnight seemed to close in upon us, and through the
darkness harshly rang a strange wild song:

  He thought he saw a Buffalo
    Upon the chimney-piece:
  He looked again, and found it was
    His Sisters Husbands Niece STOP Unless you leave this house, he said,
    Ill send for the Police STOP [Illustration: HE THOUGHT HE SAW A BUFFALO]

That was _me_ STOP he added, looking out at us, through the half-opened
door, as we stood waiting in the road STOP And thats what Id have doneas
sure as potatoes arent radishesif she hadnt have tooken herself off STOP But I always loves my _pay-rints_ like anything STOP Who are oor _pay-rints_ STOP said Bruno STOP Them as pay _rint_ for me, a course STOP the Gardener replied STOP You can
come in now, if you like STOP He flung the door open as he spoke, and we got out, a little dazzled and
stupefied (at least _I_ felt so) at the sudden transition from the
half-darkness of the railway-carriage to the brilliantly-lighted
platform of Elveston Station STOP A footman, in a handsome livery, came forwards and respectfully touched
his hat STOP The carriage is here, my Lady, he said, taking from her the
wraps and small articles she was carrying: and Lady Muriel, after
shaking hands and bidding me Good-night STOP with a pleasant smile,
followed him STOP It was with a somewhat blank and lonely feeling that I betook myself to
the van from which the luggage was being taken out: and, after giving
directions to have my boxes sent after me, I made my way on foot to
Arthurs lodgings, and soon lost my lonely feeling in the hearty welcome
my old friend gave me, and the cozy warmth and cheerful light of the
little sitting-room into which he led me STOP Little, as you see, but quite enough for us two STOP Now, take the
easy-chair, old fellow, and lets have another look at you STOP Well, you
_do_ look a bit pulled down STOP and he put on a solemn professional air STOP I prescribe Ozone, _quant STOP suff._ Social dissipation, _fiant pilul
quam plurim_: to be taken, feasting, three times a day STOP But, Doctor STOP I remonstrated STOP Society doesnt receive three times a
day STOP Thats all _you_ know about it STOP the young Doctor gaily replied STOP At
home, lawn-tennis, 3 P.M. At home, kettledrum, 5 P.M. At home, music
(Elveston doesnt give dinners), 8 P.M. Carriages at 10 STOP There you are STOP It sounded very pleasant, I was obliged to admit STOP And I know some of
the _lady_-society already, I added STOP One of them came in the same
carriage with me STOP What was she like STOP Then perhaps I can identify her STOP The _name_ was Lady Muriel Orme STOP As to what she was _like_well, _I_
thought her very beautiful STOP Do you know her STOP YesI do know her STOP And the grave Doctor coloured slightly as he added
Yes, I agree with you STOP She _is_ beautiful STOP _I_ quite lost my heart to her STOP I went on mischievously STOP We talked

Have some supper STOP Arthur interrupted with an air of relief, as the
maid entered with the tray STOP And he steadily resisted all my attempts to
return to the subject of Lady Muriel until the evening had almost worn
itself away STOP Then, as we sat gazing into the fire, and conversation was
lapsing into silence, he made a hurried confession STOP I hadnt meant to tell you anything about her, he said (naming no
names, as if there were only one she in the world! STOP till you had seen
more of her, and formed your own judgment of her: but somehow you
surprised it out of me STOP And Ive not breathed a word of it to any one
else STOP But I can trust _you_ with a secret, old friend STOP Yes STOP Its true of
_me_, what I suppose _you_ said in jest STOP In the merest jest, believe me STOP I said earnestly STOP Why, man, Im three
times her age STOP But if shes _your_ choice, then Im sure shes all that
is good and

and sweet, Arthur went on, and pure, and self-denying, and
true-hearted, and he broke off hastily, as if he could not trust
himself to say more on a subject so sacred and so precious STOP Silence
followed: and I leaned back drowsily in my easy-chair, filled with
bright and beautiful imaginings of Arthur and his lady-love, and of all
the peace and happiness in store for them STOP I pictured them to myself walking together, lingeringly and lovingly,
under arching trees, in a sweet garden of their own, and welcomed back
by their faithful gardener, on their return from some brief excursion STOP It seemed natural enough that the gardener should be filled with
exuberant delight at the return of so gracious a master and mistressand
how strangely childlike they looked STOP I could have taken them for Sylvie
and Brunoless natural that he should show it by such wild dances, such
crazy songs STOP He thought he saw a Rattlesnake
      That questioned him in Greek:
  He looked again, and found it was
      The Middle of Next Week STOP The one thing I regret, he said,
      Is that it cannot speak STOP least natural of all that the Vice-Warden and my Lady should be
standing close beside me, discussing an open letter, which had just been
handed to him by the Professor, who stood, meekly waiting, a few yards
off STOP If it were not for those two brats, I heard him mutter, glancing
savagely at Sylvie and Bruno, who were courteously listening to the
Gardeners song, there would be no difficulty whatever STOP Lets hear that bit of the letter again, said my Lady STOP And the
Vice-Warden read aloud:

and we therefore entreat you graciously to accept the Kingship, to
which you have been unanimously elected by the Council of Elfland: and
that you will allow your son Brunoof whose goodness, cleverness, and
beauty, reports have reached usto be regarded as Heir-Apparent STOP But whats the difficulty STOP said my Lady STOP Why, dont you see STOP The Ambassador, that brought this, is waiting in
the house: and hes sure to see Sylvie and Bruno: and then, when he sees
Uggug, and remembers all that about goodness, cleverness, and beauty,
why, hes sure to

And _where_ will you find a better boy than _Uggug_ STOP my Lady
indignantly interrupted STOP Or a wittier, or a lovelier STOP To all of which the Vice-Warden simply replied Dont you be a great
blethering goose STOP Our only chance is to keep those two brats out of
sight STOP If _you_ can manage _that_, you may leave the rest to _me_ STOP _Ill_ make him believe Uggug to be a model of cleverness and all that STOP We must change his name to Bruno, of course STOP said my Lady STOP The Vice-Warden rubbed his chin STOP Humph STOP No STOP he said musingly STOP Wouldnt do STOP The boys such an utter idiot, hed never learn to answer
to it STOP _Idiot_, indeed STOP cried my Lady STOP Hes no more an idiot than _I_ am STOP Youre right, my dear, the Vice-Warden soothingly replied STOP He isnt,
indeed STOP My Lady was appeased STOP Lets go in and receive the Ambassador, she
said, and beckoned to the Professor STOP Which room is he waiting in STOP she
inquired STOP In the Library, Madam STOP And _what_ did you say his name was STOP said the Vice-Warden STOP The Professor referred to a card he held in his hand STOP His Adiposity the
Baron Doppelgeist STOP Why does he come with such a funny name STOP said my Lady STOP He couldnt well change it on the journey, the Professor meekly
replied, because of the luggage STOP _You_ go and receive him, my Lady said to the Vice-Warden, and _Ill_
attend to the children STOP  STOP THE BARONS EMBASSY STOP I was following the Vice-Warden, but, on second thoughts, went after my
Lady, being curious to see how she would manage to keep the children out
of sight STOP I found her holding Sylvies hand, and with her other hand stroking
Brunos hair in a most tender and motherly fashion: both children were
looking bewildered and half-frightened STOP My own darlings, she was saying, Ive been planning a little treat
for you STOP The Professor shall take you a long walk into the woods this
beautiful evening: and you shall take a basket of food with you, and
have a little picnic down by the river STOP Bruno jumped, and clapped his hands STOP That _are_ nice STOP he cried STOP Arent it, Sylvie STOP Sylvie, who hadnt quite lost her surprised look, put up her mouth for a
kiss STOP Thank you _very_ much, she said earnestly STOP My Lady turned her head away to conceal the broad grin of triumph that
spread over her vast face, like a ripple on a lake STOP Little simpletons STOP she muttered to herself, as she marched up to the house STOP I followed her
in STOP Quite so, your Excellency, the Baron was saying as we entered the
Library STOP All the infantry were under _my_ command STOP He turned, and was
duly presented to my Lady STOP A _military_ hero STOP said my Lady STOP The fat little man simpered STOP Well,
yes, he replied, modestly casting down his eyes STOP My ancestors were all
famous for military genius STOP My Lady smiled graciously STOP It often runs in families, she remarked:
just as a love for pastry does STOP The Baron looked slightly offended, and the Vice-Warden discreetly
changed the subject STOP Dinner will soon be ready, he said STOP May I have
the honour of conducting your Adiposity to the guest-chamber STOP Certainly, certainly STOP the Baron eagerly assented STOP It would never do
to keep _dinner_ waiting STOP And he almost trotted out of the room after
the Vice-Warden STOP He was back again so speedily that the Vice-Warden had barely time to
explain to my Lady that her remark about a love for pastry was
unfortunate STOP You might have seen, with half an eye, he added, that
thats _his_ line STOP Military genius, indeed STOP Pooh STOP Dinner ready yet STOP the Baron enquired, as he hurried into the room STOP Will be in a few minutes, the Vice-Warden replied STOP Meanwhile, lets
take a turn in the garden STOP You were telling me, he continued, as the
trio left the house, something about a great battle in which you had
the command of the infantry

True, said the Baron STOP The enemy, as I was saying, far outnumbered us:
but I marched my men right into the middle ofwhats that STOP the Military
Hero exclaimed in agitated tones, drawing back behind the Vice-Warden,
as a strange creature rushed wildly upon them, brandishing a spade STOP Its only the Gardener STOP the Vice-Warden replied in an encouraging
tone STOP Quite harmless, I assure you STOP Hark, hes singing STOP Its his
favorite amusement STOP And once more those shrill discordant tones rang out:

  He thought he saw a Bankers Clerk
    Descending from the bus:
  He looked again, and found it was
    A Hippopotamus:
  If this should stay to dine, he said,
    There wont be much for us STOP Throwing away the spade, he broke into a frantic jig, snapping his
fingers, and repeating, again and again

  There wont be much for us STOP There wont be much for us STOP [Illustration: IT WAS A HIPPOPOTAMUS]

Once more the Baron looked slightly offended, but the Vice-Warden
hastily explained that the song had no allusion to _him_, and in fact
had no meaning at all STOP You didnt mean anything by it, now _did_ you STOP He appealed to the Gardener, who had finished his song, and stood,
balancing himself on one leg, and looking at them, with his mouth open STOP I never means nothing, said the Gardener: and Uggug luckily came up at
the moment, and gave the conversation a new turn STOP Allow me to present my son, said the Vice-Warden; adding, in a
whisper, one of the best and cleverest boys that ever lived STOP Ill
contrive for you to see some of his cleverness STOP He knows everything that
other boys _dont_ know; and in archery, in fishing, in painting, and in
music, his skill isbut you shall judge for yourself STOP You see that
target over there STOP He shall shoot an arrow at it STOP Dear boy, he went on
aloud, his Adiposity would like to see you shoot STOP Bring his Highness
bow and arrows STOP Uggug looked very sulky as he received the bow and arrow, and prepared
to shoot STOP Just as the arrow left the bow, the Vice-Warden trod heavily
on the toe of the Baron, who yelled with the pain STOP Ten thousand pardons STOP he exclaimed STOP I stepped back in my excitement STOP See STOP It is a bulls-eye STOP The Baron gazed in astonishment STOP He held the bow so awkwardly, it
seemed impossible STOP he muttered STOP But there was no room for doubt: there
was the arrow, right in the centre of the bulls-eye STOP The lake is close by, continued the Vice-Warden STOP Bring his Highness
fishing-rod STOP And Uggug most unwillingly held the rod, and dangled the
fly over the water STOP A beetle on your arm STOP cried my Lady, pinching the poor Barons arm
worse than if ten lobsters had seized it at once STOP _That_ kind is
poisonous, she explained STOP But _what_ a pity STOP You missed seeing the
fish pulled out STOP An enormous dead cod-fish was lying on the bank, with the hook in its
mouth STOP I had always fancied, the Baron faltered, that cod were _salt_-water
fish STOP Not in _this_ country, said the Vice-Warden STOP Shall we go in STOP Ask my
son some question on the way_any_ subject you like STOP And the sulky boy
was violently shoved forwards, to walk at the Barons side STOP Could your Highness tell me, the Baron cautiously began, how much
seven times nine would come to STOP Turn to the left STOP cried the Vice-Warden, hastily stepping forwards to
show the wayso hastily, that he ran against his unfortunate guest, who
fell heavily on his face STOP _So_ sorry STOP my Lady exclaimed, as she and her husband helped him to
his feet again STOP My son was in the act of saying sixty-three as you
fell STOP The Baron said nothing: he was covered with dust, and seemed much hurt,
both in body and mind STOP However, when they had got him into the house,
and given him a good brushing, matters looked a little better STOP Dinner was served in due course, and every fresh dish seemed to increase
the good-humour of the Baron: but all efforts, to get him to express his
opinion as to Uggugs cleverness, were in vain, until that interesting
youth had left the room, and was seen from the open window, prowling
about the lawn with a little basket, which he was filling with frogs STOP So fond of Natural History as he is, dear boy STOP said the doting mother STOP Now _do_ tell us, Baron, what you think of him STOP To be perfectly candid, said the cautious Baron, I would like a
_little_ more evidence STOP I think you mentioned his skill in

Music STOP said the Vice-Warden STOP Why, hes simply a prodigy STOP You shall
hear him play the piano STOP And he walked to the window STOP UgI mean my
boy STOP Come in for a minute, _and bring the music-master with you_ STOP To
turn over the music for him, he added as an explanation STOP Uggug, having filled his basket with frogs, had no objection to obey,
and soon appeared in the room, followed by a fierce-looking little man,
who asked the Vice-Warden Vot music vill you haf STOP The Sonata that His Highness plays so charmingly, said the
Vice-Warden STOP His Highness haf not the music-master began, but was sharply stopped
by the Vice-Warden STOP Silence, Sir STOP Go and turn over the music for his Highness STOP My dear,
(to the Wardeness) will you show him what to do STOP And meanwhile, Baron,
Ill just show you a most interesting map we haveof Outland, and
Fairyland, and that sort of thing STOP [Illustration: THE MAP OF FAIRYLAND]

By the time my Lady had returned, from explaining things to the
music-master, the map had been hung up, and the Baron was already much
bewildered by the Vice-Wardens habit of pointing to one place while he
shouted out the name of another STOP My Lady joining in, pointing out other places, and shouting other names,
only made matters worse; and at last the Baron, in despair, took to
pointing out places for himself, and feebly asked Is that great yellow
splotch _Fairyland_ STOP Yes, thats Fairyland, said the Vice-Warden: and you might as well
give him a hint, he muttered to my Lady, about going back to-morrow STOP He eats like a shark STOP It would hardly do for _me_ to mention it STOP His wife caught the idea, and at once began giving hints of the most
subtle and delicate kind STOP Just see what a short way it is back to
Fairyland STOP Why, if you started to-morrow morning, youd get there in
very little more than a week STOP The Baron looked incredulous STOP It took me a full month to _come_, he
said STOP But its ever so much shorter, going _back_, you know STOP The Baron looked appealingly to the Vice-Warden, who chimed in readily STOP You can go back _five_ times, in the time it took you to come here
_once_if you start to-morrow morning STOP All this time the Sonata was pealing through the room STOP The Baron could
not help admitting to himself that it was being magnificently played:
but he tried in vain to get a glimpse of the youthful performer STOP Every
time he had nearly succeeded in catching sight of him, either the
Vice-Warden or his wife was sure to get in the way, pointing out some
new place on the map, and deafening him with some new name STOP He gave in at last, wished a hasty good-night, and left the room, while
his host and hostess interchanged looks of triumph STOP Deftly done STOP cried the Vice-Warden STOP Craftily contrived STOP But what
means all that tramping on the stairs STOP He half-opened the door, looked
out, and added in a tone of dismay, The Barons boxes are being carried
down STOP And what means all that rumbling of wheels STOP cried my Lady STOP She peeped
through the window curtains STOP The Barons carriage has come round STOP she
groaned STOP At this moment the door opened: a fat, furious face looked in: a voice,
hoarse with passion, thundered out the words My room is full of frogsI
leave you STOP : and the door closed again STOP And still the noble Sonata went pealing through the room: but it was
_Arthurs_ masterly touch that roused the echoes, and thrilled my very
soul with the tender music of the immortal Sonata Pathetique: and it
was not till the last note had died away that the tired but happy
traveler could bring himself to utter the words good-night STOP and to
seek his much-needed pillow STOP  STOP A RIDE ON A LION STOP The next day glided away, pleasantly enough, partly in settling myself
in my new quarters, and partly in strolling round the neighbourhood,
under Arthurs guidance, and trying to form a general idea of Elveston
and its inhabitants STOP When five oclock arrived, Arthur proposedwithout
any embarrassment this timeto take me with him up to the Hall, in
order that I might make acquaintance with the Earl of Ainslie, who had
taken it for the season, and renew acquaintance with his daughter Lady
Muriel STOP My first impressions of the gentle, dignified, and yet genial old man
were entirely favourable: and the _real_ satisfaction that showed itself
on his daughters face, as she met me with the words this is indeed an
unlooked-for pleasure!, was very soothing for whatever remains of
personal vanity the failures and disappointments of many long years, and
much buffeting with a rough world, had left in me STOP Yet I noted, and was glad to note, evidence of a far deeper feeling than
mere friendly regard, in her meeting with Arthurthough this was, as I
gathered, an almost daily occurrenceand the conversation between them,
in which the Earl and I were only occasional sharers, had an ease and a
spontaneity rarely met with except between _very_ old friends: and, as I
knew that they had not known each other for a longer period than the
summer which was now rounding into autumn, I felt certain that Love,
and Love alone, could explain the phenomenon STOP How convenient it would be, Lady Muriel laughingly remarked, _a
propos_ of my having insisted on saving her the trouble of carrying a
cup of tea across the room to the Earl, if cups of tea had no weight at
all STOP Then perhaps ladies would _sometimes_ be permitted to carry them
for short distances STOP One can easily imagine a situation, said Arthur, where things would
_necessarily_ have no weight, relatively to each other, though each
would have its usual weight, looked at by itself STOP Some desperate paradox STOP said the Earl STOP Tell us how it could be STOP We
shall never guess it STOP Well, suppose this house, just as it is, placed a few billion miles
above a planet, and with nothing else near enough to disturb it: of
course it falls _to_ the planet STOP The Earl nodded STOP Of coursethough it might take some centuries to do
it STOP And is five-oclock-tea to be going on all the while STOP said Lady
Muriel STOP That, and other things, said Arthur STOP The inhabitants would live their
lives, grow up and die, and still the house would be falling, falling,
falling STOP But now as to the relative weight of things STOP Nothing can be
_heavy_, you know, except by _trying_ to fall, and being prevented from
doing so STOP You all grant that STOP We all granted that STOP Well, now, if I take this book, and hold it out at arms length, of
course I feel its _weight_ STOP It is trying to fall, and I prevent it STOP And,
if I let go, it falls to the floor STOP But, if we were all falling
together, it couldnt be _trying_ to fall any quicker, you know: for, if
I let go, what more could it do than fall STOP And, as my hand would be
falling tooat the same rateit would never leave it, for that would be
to get ahead of it in the race STOP And it could never overtake the falling
floor STOP I see it clearly, said Lady Muriel STOP But it makes one dizzy to think
of such things STOP How _can_ you make us do it STOP There is a more curious idea yet, I ventured to say STOP Suppose a cord
fastened to the house, from below, and pulled down by some one on the
planet STOP Then of course the _house_ goes faster than its natural rate of
falling: but the furniturewith our noble selveswould go on falling at
their old pace, and would therefore be left behind STOP Practically, we should rise to the ceiling, said the Earl STOP The
inevitable result of which would be concussion of brain STOP To avoid that, said Arthur, let us have the furniture fixed to the
floor, and ourselves tied down to the furniture STOP Then the
five-oclock-tea could go on in peace STOP With one little drawback STOP Lady Muriel gaily interrupted STOP We should
take the _cups_ down with us: but what about the _tea_ STOP I had forgotten the _tea_, Arthur confessed STOP _That_, no doubt, would
rise to the ceilingunless you chose to drink it on the way STOP Which, I think, is _quite_ nonsense enough for one while STOP said the
Earl STOP What news does this gentleman bring us from the great world of
London STOP This drew _me_ into the conversation, which now took a more conventional
tone STOP After a while, Arthur gave the signal for our departure, and in
the cool of the evening we strolled down to the beach, enjoying the
silence, broken only by the murmur of the sea and the far-away music of
some fishermens song, almost as much as our late pleasant talk STOP We sat down among the rocks, by a little pool, so rich in animal,
vegetable, and zoophyticor whatever is the right wordlife, that I
became entranced in the study of it, and, when Arthur proposed returning
to our lodgings, I begged to be left there for a while, to watch and
muse alone STOP The fishermens song grew ever nearer and clearer, as their boat stood
in for the beach; and I would have gone down to see them land their
cargo of fish, had not the microcosm at my feet stirred my curiosity yet
more keenly STOP One ancient crab, that was for ever shuffling frantically from side to
side of the pool, had particularly fascinated me: there was a vacancy in
its stare, and an aimless violence in its behaviour, that irresistibly
recalled the Gardener who had befriended Sylvie and Bruno: and, as I
gazed, I caught the concluding notes of the tune of his crazy song STOP The silence that followed was broken by the sweet voice of Sylvie STOP Would you please let us out into the road STOP What STOP After that old beggar again STOP the Gardener yelled, and began
singing:

  He thought he saw a Kangaroo
    That worked a coffee-mill:
  He looked again, and found it was
    A Vegetable-Pill STOP Were I to swallow this, he said,
    I should be very ill STOP We dont want him to swallow _anything_, Sylvie explained STOP Hes not
hungry STOP But we want to see him STOP So will you please

[Illustration: HE THOUGHT HE SAW A KANGAROO]

Certainly STOP the Gardener promptly replied STOP I _always_ please STOP Never
displeases nobody STOP There you are STOP And he flung the door open, and let
us out upon the dusty high-road STOP We soon found our way to the bush, which had so mysteriously sunk into
the ground: and here Sylvie drew the Magic Locket from its hiding-place,
turned it over with a thoughtful air, and at last appealed to Bruno in a
rather helpless way STOP What _was_ it we had to do with it, Bruno STOP Its
all gone out of my head STOP Kiss it STOP was Brunos invariable recipe in cases of doubt and
difficulty STOP Sylvie kissed it, but no result followed STOP Rub it the wrong way, was Brunos next suggestion STOP Which _is_ the wrong way STOP Sylvie most reasonably enquired STOP The obvious
plan was to try _both_ ways STOP Rubbing from left to right had no visible effect whatever STOP From right to leftOh, stop, Sylvie STOP Bruno cried in sudden alarm STOP Whatever _is_ going to happen STOP For a number of trees, on the neighbouring hillside, were moving slowly
upwards, in solemn procession: while a mild little brook, that had been
rippling at our feet a moment before, began to swell, and foam, and
hiss, and bubble, in a truly alarming fashion STOP [Illustration: THE MOUSE-LION]

Rub it some other way STOP cried Bruno STOP Try up-and-down STOP Quick STOP It was a happy thought STOP Up-and-down did it: and the landscape, which had
been showing signs of mental aberration in various directions, returned
to its normal condition of sobrietywith the exception of a small
yellowish-brown mouse, which continued to run wildly up and down the
road, lashing its tail like a little lion STOP Lets follow it, said Sylvie: and this also turned out a happy
thought STOP The mouse at once settled down into a business-like jog-trot,
with which we could easily keep pace STOP The only phenomenon, that gave me
any uneasiness, was the rapid increase in the _size_ of the little
creature we were following, which became every moment more and more like
a real lion STOP Soon the transformation was complete: and a noble lion stood patiently
waiting for us to come up with it STOP No thought of fear seemed to occur to
the children, who patted and stroked it as if it had been a
Shetland-pony STOP Help me up STOP cried Bruno STOP And in another moment Sylvie had lifted him
upon the broad back of the gentle beast, and seated herself behind him,
pillion-fashion STOP Bruno took a good handful of mane in each hand, and
made believe to guide this new kind of steed STOP Gee-up STOP seemed quite
sufficient by way of _verbal_ direction: the lion at once broke into an
easy canter, and we soon found ourselves in the depths of the forest STOP I
say _we_, for I am certain that _I_ accompanied themthough _how_ I
managed to keep up with a cantering lion I am wholly unable to explain STOP But I was certainly one of the party when we came upon an old beggar-man
cutting sticks, at whose feet the lion made a profound obeisance, Sylvie
and Bruno at the same moment dismounting, and leaping into the arms of
their father STOP From bad to worse STOP the old man said to himself, dreamily, when the
children had finished their rather confused account of the Ambassadors
visit, gathered no doubt from general report, as they had not seen him
themselves STOP From bad to worse STOP That is their destiny STOP I see it, but I
cannot alter it STOP The selfishness of a mean and crafty manthe
selfishness of an ambitious and silly womanthe selfishness of a
spiteful and loveless childall tend one way, from bad to worse STOP And
you, my darlings, must suffer it awhile, I fear STOP Yet, when things are at
their worst, you can come to me STOP I can do but little as yet

Gathering up a handful of dust and scattering it in the air, he slowly
and solemnly pronounced some words that sounded like a charm, the
children looking on in awe-struck silence:

  Let craft, ambition, spite,
  Be quenched in Reasons night,
  Till weakness turn to might,
  Till what is dark be light,
  Till what is wrong be right STOP The cloud of dust spread itself out through the air, as if it were
alive, forming curious shapes that were for ever changing into others STOP It makes letters STOP It makes words STOP Bruno whispered, as he clung,
half-frightened, to Sylvie STOP Only I _cant_ make them out STOP Read them,
Sylvie STOP Ill try, Sylvie gravely replied STOP Wait a minuteif only I could see
that word

I should be very ill STOP a discordant voice yelled in our ears STOP Were I to swallow this, he said,
    I should be very ill STOP  STOP A JESTER AND A BEAR STOP Yes, we were in the garden once more: and, to escape that horrid
discordant voice, we hurried indoors, and found ourselves in the
libraryUggug blubbering, the Professor standing by with a bewildered
air, and my Lady, with her arms clasped round her sons neck, repeating,
over and over again, and _did_ they give him nasty lessons to learn STOP My
own pretty pet STOP Whats all this noise about STOP the Vice-Warden angrily enquired, as he
strode into the room STOP And who put the hat-stand here STOP And he hung his
hat up on Bruno, who was standing in the middle of the room, too much
astonished by the sudden change of scene to make any attempt at removing
it, though it came down to his shoulders, making him look something like
a small candle with a large extinguisher over it STOP The Professor mildly explained that His Highness had been graciously
pleased to say he wouldnt do his lessons STOP Do your lessons this instant, you young cub STOP thundered the
Vice-Warden STOP And take _this_ STOP and a resounding box on the ear made the
unfortunate Professor reel across the room STOP Save me STOP faltered the poor old man, as he sank, half-fainting, at my
Ladys feet STOP Shave you STOP Of course I will STOP my Lady replied, as she lifted him into a
chair, and pinned an anti-macassar round his neck STOP Wheres the razor STOP The Vice-Warden meanwhile had got hold of Uggug, and was belabouring him
with his umbrella STOP Who left this loose nail in the floor STOP he shouted STOP Hammer it in, I say STOP Hammer it in STOP Blow after blow fell on the
writhing Uggug, till he dropped howling to the floor STOP [Illustration: HAMMER IT IN! STOP Then his father turned to the shaving scene which was being enacted,
and roared with laughter STOP Excuse me, dear, I cant help it STOP he said
as soon as he could speak STOP You _are_ such an utter donkey STOP Kiss me,
Tabby STOP And he flung his arms round the neck of the terrified Professor, who
raised a wild shriek, but whether he received the threatened kiss or not
I was unable to see, as Bruno, who had by this time released himself
from his extinguisher, rushed headlong out of the room, followed by
Sylvie; and I was so fearful of being left alone among all these crazy
creatures that I hurried after them STOP We must go to Father STOP Sylvie panted, as they ran down the garden STOP Im
_sure_ things are at their worst STOP Ill ask the Gardener to let us out
again STOP But we cant _walk_ all the way STOP Bruno whimpered STOP How I _wiss_ we
had a coach-and-four, like Uncle STOP And, shrill and wild, rang through the air the familiar voice:

  He thought he saw a Coach-and-Four
    That stood beside his bed:
  He looked again, and found it was
    A Bear without a Head STOP Poor thing, he said, poor silly thing STOP Its waiting to be fed STOP [Illustration: A BEAR WITHOUT A HEAD]

No, I cant let you out again STOP he said, before the children could
speak STOP The Vice-Warden gave it me, he did, for letting you out last
time STOP So be off with you STOP And, turning away from them, he began digging
frantically in the middle of a gravel-walk, singing, over and over
again,

  Poor thing, he said, poor silly thing STOP Its waiting to be fed STOP but in a more musical tone than the shrill screech in which he had
begun STOP The music grew fuller and richer at every moment: other manly voices
joined in the refrain: and soon I heard the heavy thud that told me the
boat had touched the beach, and the harsh grating of the shingle as the
men dragged it up STOP I roused myself, and, after lending them a hand in
hauling up their boat, I lingered yet awhile to watch them disembark a
goodly assortment of the hard-won treasures of the deep STOP When at last I reached our lodgings I was tired and sleepy, and glad
enough to settle down again into the easy-chair, while Arthur hospitably
went to his cupboard, to get me out some cake and wine, without which,
he declared, he could not, as a doctor, permit my going to bed STOP And how that cupboard-door _did_ creak STOP It surely could not be _Arthur_,
who was opening and shutting it so often, moving so restlessly about,
and muttering like the soliloquy of a tragedy-queen STOP No, it was a _female_ voice STOP Also the figurehalf-hidden by the
cupboard-doorwas a _female_ figure, massive, and in flowing robes STOP Could it be the landlady STOP The door opened, and a strange man entered the
room STOP What _is_ that donkey doing STOP he said to himself, pausing, aghast, on
the threshold STOP The lady, thus rudely referred to, was his wife STOP She had got one of the
cupboards open, and stood with her back to him, smoothing down a sheet
of brown paper on one of the shelves, and whispering to herself So, so STOP Deftly done STOP Craftily contrived STOP Her loving husband stole behind her on tiptoe, and tapped her on the
head STOP Boh STOP he playfully shouted at her ear STOP Never tell me again I
cant say boh to a goose STOP My Lady wrung her hands STOP Discovered STOP she groaned STOP Yet nohe is one of
us STOP Reveal it not, oh Man STOP Let it bide its time STOP Reveal _what_ not STOP her husband testily replied, dragging out the sheet
of brown paper STOP What are you hiding here, my Lady STOP I insist upon
knowing STOP My Lady cast down her eyes, and spoke in the littlest of little voices STOP Dont make fun of it, Benjamin STOP she pleaded STOP Itsitsdont you
understand STOP Its a DAGGER STOP And whats _that_ for STOP sneered His Excellency STOP Weve only got to make
people _think_ hes dead STOP We havent got to _kill_ him STOP And made of tin,
too STOP he snarled, contemptuously bending the blade round his thumb STOP Now, Madam, youll be good enough to explain STOP First, what do you call
me _Benjamin_ for STOP Its part of the Conspiracy, Love STOP One _must_ have an alias, you
know

Oh, an _alias_, is it STOP Well STOP And next, what did you get this dagger
for STOP Come, no evasions STOP You cant deceive _me_ STOP I got it forforfor the detected Conspirator stammered, trying her
best to put on the assassin-expression that she had been practising at
the looking-glass STOP For

For _what_, Madam STOP Well, for eighteenpence, if you _must_ know, dearest STOP Thats what I got
it for, on my

Now _dont_ say your Word and Honour STOP groaned the other Conspirator STOP Why, they arent worth half the money, put together STOP On my _birthday_, my Lady concluded in a meek whisper STOP One _must_
have a dagger, you know STOP Its part of the

Oh, dont talk of Conspiracies STOP her husband savagely interrupted, as
he tossed the dagger into the cupboard STOP You know about as much how to
manage a Conspiracy as if you were a chicken STOP Why, the first thing is to
get a disguise STOP Now, just look at this STOP And with pardonable pride he fitted on the cap and bells, and the rest
of the Fools dress, and winked at her, and put his tongue in his cheek STOP Is _that_ the sort of thing, now STOP he demanded STOP My Ladys eyes flashed with all a Conspirators enthusiasm STOP The very
thing STOP she exclaimed, clapping her hands STOP You do look, oh, such a
_perfect_ Fool STOP The Fool smiled a doubtful smile STOP He was not quite clear whether it was
a compliment or not, to express it so plainly STOP You mean a Jester STOP Yes,
thats what I intended STOP And what do you think _your_ disguise is to be STOP And he proceeded to unfold the parcel, the lady watching him in rapture STOP Oh, how lovely STOP she cried, when at last the dress was unfolded STOP What
a _splendid_ disguise STOP An Esquimaux peasant-woman STOP An Esquimaux peasant, indeed STOP growled the other STOP Here, put it on, and
look at yourself in the glass STOP Why, its a _Bear_, cant you use your
eyes STOP He checked himself suddenly, as a harsh voice yelled through the
room

  He looked again, and found it was
    A Bear without a Head STOP But it was only the Gardener, singing under the open window STOP The
Vice-Warden stole on tip-toe to the window, and closed it noiselessly,
before he ventured to go on STOP Yes, Lovey, a _Bear_: but not without a
_head_, I hope STOP Youre the Bear, and me the Keeper STOP And if any one knows
us, theyll have sharp eyes, thats all STOP I shall have to practise the steps a bit, my Lady said, looking out
through the Bears mouth: one cant help being rather human just at
first, you know STOP And of course youll say Come up, Bruin!, wont you STOP Yes, of course, replied the Keeper, laying hold of the chain, that
hung from the Bears collar, with one hand, while with the other he
cracked a little whip STOP Now go round the room in a sort of a dancing
attitude STOP Very good, my dear, very good STOP Come up, Bruin STOP Come up, I
say STOP [Illustration: COME UP, BRUIN! STOP He roared out the last words for the benefit of Uggug, who had just come
into the room, and was now standing, with his hands spread out, and eyes
and mouth wide open, the very picture of stupid amazement STOP Oh, my STOP was
all he could gasp out STOP The Keeper pretended to be adjusting the bears collar, which gave him
an opportunity of whispering, unheard by Uggug, _my_ fault, Im afraid STOP Quite forgot to fasten the door STOP Plots ruined if _he_ finds it out STOP Keep it up a minute or two longer STOP Be savage STOP Then, while seeming to
pull it back with all his strength, he let it advance upon the scared
boy: my Lady, with admirable presence of mind, kept up what she no doubt
intended for a savage growl, though it was more like the purring of a
cat: and Uggug backed out of the room with such haste that he tripped
over the mat, and was heard to fall heavily outsidean accident to which
even his doting mother paid no heed, in the excitement of the moment STOP The Vice-Warden shut and bolted the door STOP Off with the disguises STOP he
panted STOP Theres not a moment to lose STOP Hes sure to fetch the Professor,
and we couldnt take _him_ in, you know STOP And in another minute the
disguises were stowed away in the cupboard, the door unbolted, and the
two Conspirators seated lovingly side-by-side on the sofa, earnestly
discussing a book the Vice-Warden had hastily snatched off the table,
which proved to be the City-Directory of the capital of Outland STOP The door opened, very slowly and cautiously, and the Professor peeped
in, Uggugs stupid face being just visible behind him STOP It is a beautiful arrangement STOP the Vice-Warden was saying with
enthusiasm STOP You see, my precious one, that there are fifteen houses in
Green Street, _before_ you turn into West Street STOP _Fifteen_ houses STOP Is it _possible_ STOP my Lady replied STOP I thought it was
fourteen STOP And, so intent were they on this interesting question, that
neither of them even looked up till the Professor, leading Uggug by the
hand, stood close before them STOP My Lady was the first to notice their approach STOP Why, heres the
Professor STOP she exclaimed in her blandest tones STOP And my precious child
too STOP Are lessons over STOP A strange thing has happened STOP the Professor began in a trembling tone STOP His Exalted Fatness (this was one of Uggugs many titles) tells me he
has just seen, in this very room, a Dancing-Bear and a Court-Jester STOP The Vice-Warden and his wife shook with well-acted merriment STOP Not in _this_ room, darling STOP said the fond mother STOP Weve been sitting
here this hour or more, reading, here she referred to the book lying
on her lap, reading thethe City-Directory STOP Let me feel your pulse, my boy STOP said the anxious father STOP Now put out
your tongue STOP Ah, I thought so STOP Hes a little feverish, Professor, and
has had a bad dream STOP Put him to bed at once, and give him a cooling
draught STOP I aint been dreaming STOP his Exalted Fatness remonstrated, as the
Professor led him away STOP Bad grammar, Sir STOP his father remarked with some sternness STOP Kindly
attend to _that_ little matter, Professor, as soon as you have corrected
the feverishness STOP And, by the way, Professor STOP (The Professor left his
distinguished pupil standing at the door, and meekly returned. STOP There
is a rumour afloat, that the people wish to elect anin point of fact,
anyou understand that I mean an

Not _another Professor_ STOP the poor old man exclaimed in horror STOP No STOP Certainly not STOP the Vice-Warden eagerly explained STOP Merely an
_Emperor_, you understand STOP An _Emperor_ STOP cried the astonished Professor, holding his head between
his hands, as if he expected it to come to pieces with the shock STOP What
will the Warden

Why, the _Warden_ will most likely _be_ the new Emperor STOP my Lady
explained STOP Where could we find a better STOP Unless, perhaps she glanced
at her husband STOP Where indeed STOP the Professor fervently responded, quite failing to take
the hint STOP The Vice-Warden resumed the thread of his discourse STOP The reason I
mentioned it, Professor, was to ask _you_ to be so kind as to preside at
the Election STOP You see it would make the thing _respectable_no suspicion
of anything underhand

I fear I cant, your Excellency STOP the old man faltered STOP What will the
Warden

True, true STOP the Vice-Warden interrupted STOP Your position, as
Court-Professor, makes it awkward, I admit STOP Well, well STOP Then the
Election shall be held without you STOP Better so, than if it were held _within_ me STOP the Professor murmured
with a bewildered air, as if he hardly knew what he was saying STOP Bed, I
think your Highness said, and a cooling-draught STOP And he wandered
dreamily back to where Uggug sulkily awaited him STOP I followed them out of the room, and down the passage, the Professor
murmuring to himself, all the time, as a kind of aid to his feeble
memory, C, C, C; Couch, Cooling-Draught, Correct-Grammar, till, in
turning a corner, he met Sylvie and Bruno, so suddenly that the startled
Professor let go of his fat pupil, who instantly took to his heels STOP  STOP THE OTHER PROFESSOR STOP We were looking for you STOP cried Sylvie, in a tone of great relief STOP We
_do_ want you so much, you cant think STOP What is it, dear children STOP the Professor asked, beaming on them with a
very different look from what Uggug ever got from him STOP We want you to speak to the Gardener for us, Sylvie said, as she and
Bruno took the old mans hands and led him into the hall STOP Hes ever so unkind STOP Bruno mournfully added STOP Theys _all_ unkind to
us, now that Fathers gone STOP The Lion were _much_ nicer STOP But you must explain to me, please, the Professor said with an anxious
look, _which_ is the Lion, and _which_ is the Gardener STOP Its _most_
important not to get two such animals confused together STOP And ones very
liable to do it in their caseboth having mouths, you know

Doos oo _always_ confuses two animals together STOP Bruno asked STOP Pretty often, Im afraid, the Professor candidly confessed STOP Now, for
instance, theres the rabbit-hutch and the hall-clock STOP The Professor
pointed them out STOP One gets a little confused with _them_both having
doors, you know STOP Now, only yesterdaywould you believe it?I put some
lettuces into the clock, and tried to wind up the rabbit STOP Did the rabbit _go_, after oo wounded it up STOP said Bruno STOP The Professor clasped his hands on the top of his head, and groaned STOP Go STOP I should think it _did_ go STOP Why, its _gone_ STOP And where ever its
gone tothats what I _cant_ find out STOP Ive done my bestIve read all
the article Rabbit in the great dictionary Come in STOP Only the tailor, Sir, with your little bill, said a meek voice outside
the door STOP Ah, well, I can soon settle _his_ business, the Professor said to the
children, if youll just wait a minute STOP How much is it, this year, my
man STOP The tailor had come in while he was speaking STOP Well, its been a doubling so many years, you see, the tailor replied,
a little gruffly, and I think Id like the money now STOP Its two thousand
pound, it is STOP Oh, thats nothing STOP the Professor carelessly remarked, feeling in his
pocket, as if he always carried at least _that_ amount about with him STOP But wouldnt you like to wait just another year, and make it _four_
thousand STOP Just think how rich youd be STOP Why, you might be a _King_, if
you liked STOP I dont know as Id care about being a _King_, the man said
thoughtfully STOP But it _dew_ sound a powerful sight o money STOP Well, I
think Ill wait

Of course you will STOP said the Professor STOP Theres good sense in _you_,
I see STOP Good-day to you, my man STOP Will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds STOP Sylvie asked
as the door closed on the departing creditor STOP _Never_, my child STOP the Professor replied emphatically STOP Hell go on
doubling it, till he dies STOP You see its _always_ worth while waiting
another year, to get twice as much money STOP And now what would you like to
do, my little friends STOP Shall I take you to see the Other Professor STOP This
would be an excellent opportunity for a visit, he said to himself,
glancing at his watch: he generally takes a short restof fourteen
minutes and a halfabout this time STOP Bruno hastily went round to Sylvie, who was standing at the other side
of the Professor, and put his hand into hers STOP I _thinks_ wed like to
go, he said doubtfully: only please lets go all together STOP Its best
to be on the safe side, oo know STOP Why, you talk as if you were _Sylvie_ STOP exclaimed the Professor STOP I know I did, Bruno replied very humbly STOP I quite forgotted I wasnt
Sylvie STOP Only I fought he might be rarver fierce STOP The Professor laughed a jolly laugh STOP Oh, hes quite tame STOP he said STOP He
never bites STOP Hes only a littlea little _dreamy_, you know STOP He took
hold of Brunos other hand, and led the children down a long passage I
had never noticed beforenot that there was anything remarkable in
_that_: I was constantly coming on new rooms and passages in that
mysterious Palace, and very seldom succeeded in finding the old ones
again STOP Near the end of the passage the Professor stopped STOP This is his room,
he said, pointing to the solid wall STOP We cant get in through _there_ STOP Bruno exclaimed STOP Sylvie said nothing, till she had carefully examined whether the wall
opened anywhere STOP Then she laughed merrily: Youre playing us a trick,
you dear old thing STOP she said STOP Theres no _door_ here STOP There isnt any door to the room, said the Professor STOP We shall have
to climb in at the window STOP [Illustration: THE OTHER PROFESSOR]

So we went into the garden, and soon found the window of the Other
Professors room STOP It was a ground-floor window, and stood invitingly
open: the Professor first lifted the two children in, and then he and I
climbed in after them STOP The Other Professor was seated at a table, with a large book open before
him, on which his forehead was resting: he had clasped his arms round
the book, and was snoring heavily STOP He usually reads like that, the
Professor remarked, when the books very interesting: and then
sometimes its very difficult to get him to attend STOP This seemed to be one of the difficult times: the Professor lifted him
up, once or twice, and shook him violently: but he always returned to
his book the moment he was let go of, and showed by his heavy breathing
that the book was as interesting as ever STOP How dreamy he is STOP the Professor exclaimed STOP He must have got to a
_very_ interesting part of the book STOP And he rained quite a shower of
thumps on the Other Professors back, shouting Hoy STOP Hoy STOP all the time STOP Isnt it _wonderful_ that he should be so dreamy STOP he said to Bruno STOP If hes always as _sleepy_ as that, Bruno remarked, a _course_ hes
dreamy STOP But what are we to _do_ STOP said the Professor STOP You see hes quite
wrapped up in the book STOP Suppose oo _shuts_ the book STOP Bruno suggested STOP Thats it STOP cried the delighted Professor STOP Of course thatll do it STOP And he shut up the book so quickly that he caught the Other Professors
nose between the leaves, and gave it a severe pinch STOP The Other Professor instantly rose to his feet, and carried the book
away to the end of the room, where he put it back in its place in the
book-case STOP Ive been reading for eighteen hours and three-quarters, he
said, and now I shall rest for fourteen minutes and a half STOP Is the
Lecture all ready STOP Very nearly, the Professor humbly replied STOP I shall ask you to give me
a hint or twothere will be a few little difficulties

And a Banquet, I think you said STOP Oh, yes STOP The Banquet comes _first_, of course STOP People never enjoy
Abstract Science, you know, when theyre ravenous with hunger STOP And then
theres the Fancy-Dress-Ball STOP Oh, therell be lots of entertainment STOP Where will the Ball come in STOP said the Other Professor STOP I _think_ it had better come at the beginning of the Banquetit brings
people together so nicely, you know STOP Yes, thats the right order STOP First the Meeting: then the Eating: then
the Treatingfor Im sure any Lecture _you_ give us will be a treat STOP said the Other Professor, who had been standing with his back to us all
this time, occupying himself in taking the books out, one by one, and
turning them upside-down STOP An easel, with a black board on it, stood near
him: and, every time that he turned a book upside-down, he made a mark
on the board with a piece of chalk STOP And as to the Pig-Talewhich _you_ have so kindly promised to give
us the Professor went on, thoughtfully rubbing his chin STOP I think that
had better come at the _end_ of the Banquet: then people can listen to
it quietly STOP Shall I _sing_ it STOP the Other Professor asked, with a smile of delight STOP If you _can_, the Professor replied, cautiously STOP Let me try, said the Other Professor, seating himself at the
pianoforte STOP For the sake of argument, let us assume that it begins on A
flat STOP And he struck the note in question STOP La, la, la STOP I think thats
within an octave of it STOP He struck the note again, and appealed to
Bruno, who was standing at his side STOP Did I sing it like _that_, my
child STOP No, oo didnt, Bruno replied with great decision STOP It were more like a
duck STOP Single notes are apt to have that effect, the Other Professor said
with a sigh STOP Let me try a whole verse STOP There was a Pig, that sat alone,
    Beside a ruined Pump STOP By day and night he made his moan:
  It would have stirred a heart of stone
  To see him wring his hoofs and groan,
    Because he could not jump STOP Would you call that a tune, Professor STOP he asked, when he had finished STOP The Professor considered a little STOP Well, he said at last, some of the
notes are the same as othersand some are differentbut I should hardly
call it a _tune_ STOP Let me try it a bit by myself, said the Other Professor STOP And he began
touching the notes here and there, and humming to himself like an angry
bluebottle STOP How do you like his singing STOP the Professor asked the children in a low
voice STOP It isnt very _beautiful_, Sylvie said, hesitatingly STOP Its very extremely _ugly_ STOP Bruno said, without any hesitation at all STOP All extremes are bad, the Professor said, very gravely STOP For instance,
Sobriety is a very good thing, when practised _in moderation_: but even
Sobriety, when carried to an _extreme_, has its disadvantages STOP What are its disadvantages STOP was the question that rose in my mindand,
as usual, Bruno asked it for me STOP What _are_ its lizard bandages STOP Well, this is _one_ of them, said the Professor STOP When a mans tipsy
(thats one extreme, you know), he sees one thing as two STOP But, when hes
_extremely_ sober (thats the other extreme), he sees two things as one STOP Its equally inconvenient, whichever happens STOP What does illconvenient mean STOP Bruno whispered to Sylvie STOP The difference between convenient and inconvenient is best
explained by an example, said the Other Professor, who had overheard
the question STOP If youll just think over any Poem that contains the two
wordssuch as

The Professor put his hands over his ears, with a look of dismay STOP If
you once let him begin a _Poem_, he said to Sylvie, hell never leave
off again STOP He never does STOP Did he ever begin a Poem and not leave off again STOP Sylvie enquired STOP Three times, said the Professor STOP Bruno raised himself on tiptoe, till his lips were on a level with
Sylvies ear STOP What became of them three Poems STOP he whispered STOP Is he
saying them all, now STOP Hush STOP said Sylvie STOP The Other Professor is speaking STOP Ill say it very quick, murmured the Other Professor, with downcast
eyes, and melancholy voice, which contrasted oddly with his face, as he
had forgotten to leave off smiling STOP (At least it wasnt exactly a
_smile_, as Sylvie said afterwards: it looked as if his mouth was made
that shape. STOP Go on then, said the Professor STOP _What must be must be._

Remember that STOP Sylvie whispered to Bruno, Its a very good rule for
whenever you hurt yourself STOP And its a very good rule for whenever I make a noise, said the saucy
little fellow STOP So _you_ remember it too, Miss STOP Whatever _do_ you mean STOP said Sylvie, trying to frown, a thing she
never managed particularly well STOP Oftens and oftens, said Bruno, havent oo told me There mustnt be
so much noise, Bruno STOP when Ive tolded oo There _must_ STOP Why, there
isnt no rules at all about There mustnt STOP But oo never believes
_me_ STOP As if any one _could_ believe _you_, you wicked wicked boy STOP said
Sylvie STOP The _words_ were severe enough, but I am of opinion that, when
you are really _anxious_ to impress a criminal with a sense of his
guilt, you ought not to pronounce the sentence with your lips _quite_
close to his cheeksince a kiss at the end of it, however accidental,
weakens the effect terribly STOP  STOP PETER AND PAUL STOP As I was saying, the Other Professor resumed, if youll just think
over any Poem, that contains the wordssuch as

  Peter is poor, said noble Paul,
    And I have always been his friend:
  And, though my means to give are small,
    At least I can afford to _lend._
  How few, in this cold age of greed,
    Do good, except on selfish grounds STOP But I can feel for Peters need,
    And _I will lend him fifty pounds_ STOP How great was Peters joy to find
    His friend in such a genial vein STOP How cheerfully the bond he signed,
    To pay the money back again STOP We cant, said Paul, be too precise:
    Tis best to fix the very day:
  So, by a learned friends advice,
    Ive made it Noon, the Fourth of May STOP [Illustration: HOW CHEERFULLY THE BOND HE SIGNED! STOP But this is April STOP Peter said STOP The First of April, as I think STOP Five little weeks will soon be fled:
    One scarcely will have time to wink STOP Give me a year to speculate
    To buy and sellto drive a trade
  Said Paul I cannot change the date STOP On May the Fourth it must be paid STOP Well, well STOP said Peter, with a sigh STOP Hand me the cash, and I will go STOP Ill form a Joint-Stock Company,
    And turn an honest pound or so STOP Im grieved, said Paul, to seem unkind:
    The money shall of course be lent:
  But, for a week or two, I find
    It will not be convenient STOP So, week by week, poor Peter came
    And turned in heaviness away;
  For still the answer was the same,
    I cannot manage it to-day STOP And now the April showers were dry
    The five short weeks were nearly spent
  Yet still he got the old reply,
    It is not quite convenient STOP The Fourth arrived, and punctual Paul
    Came, with his legal friend, at noon STOP I thought it best, said he, to call:
    One cannot settle things too soon STOP Poor Peter shuddered in despair:
    His flowing locks he wildly tore:
  And very soon his yellow hair
    Was lying all about the floor STOP The legal friend was standing by,
    With sudden pity half unmanned:
  The tear-drop trembled in his eye,
    The signed agreement in his hand:
  But when at length the legal soul
    Resumed its customary force,
  The Law, he said, we cant control:
    Pay, or the Law must take its course STOP Said Paul, How bitterly I rue
    That fatal morning when I called STOP Consider, Peter, what you do STOP You wont be richer when youre bald STOP Think you, by rending curls away,
    To make your difficulties less STOP Forbear this violence, I pray:
    You do but add to my distress STOP [Illustration: POOR PETER SHUDDERED IN DESPAIR]

  Not willingly would I inflict,
    Said Peter, on that noble heart
  One needless pang STOP Yet why so strict STOP Is _this_ to act a friendly part STOP However legal it may be
    To pay what never has been lent,
  This style of business seems to me
    Extremely inconvenient STOP No Nobleness of soul have I,
    Like _some_ that in this Age are found STOP (Paul blushed in sheer humility,
    And cast his eyes upon the ground. STOP This debt will simply swallow all,
    And make my life a life of woe STOP Nay, nay, my Peter STOP answered Paul STOP You must not rail on Fortune so STOP You have enough to eat and drink:
    You are respected in the world:
  And at the barbers, as I think,
    You often get your whiskers curled STOP Though Nobleness you cant attain
    To any very great extent
  The path of Honesty is plain,
    However inconvenient STOP Tis true, said Peter, Im alive:
    I keep my station in the world:
  Once in the week I just contrive
    To get my whiskers oiled and curled STOP But my assets are very low:
    My little incomes overspent:
  To trench on capital, you know,
    Is always inconvenient STOP But pay your debts STOP cried honest Paul STOP My gentle Peter, pay your debts STOP What matter if it swallows all
    That you describe as your assets STOP Already youre an hour behind:
    Yet Generosity is best STOP It pinches mebut never mind STOP _I will not charge you interest!_

  How good STOP How great STOP poor Peter cried STOP Yet I must sell my Sunday wig
  The scarf-pin that has been my pride
    My grand pianoand my pig STOP Full soon his property took wings:
    And daily, as each treasure went,
  He sighed to find the state of things
    Grow less and less convenient STOP Weeks grew to months, and months to years:
    Peter was worn to skin and bone:
  And once he even said, with tears,
    Remember, Paul, that promised Loan STOP Said Paul Ill lend you, when I can,
    All the spare money I have got
  Ah, Peter, youre a happy man STOP Yours is an enviable lot STOP [Illustration: SUCH BOOTS AS THESE YOU SELDOM SEE]

  Im getting stout, as you may see:
    It is but seldom I am well:
  I cannot feel my ancient glee
    In listening to the dinner-bell:
  But you, you gambol like a boy,
    Your figure is so spare and light:
  The dinner-bells a note of joy
    To such a healthy appetite STOP Said Peter I am well aware
    Mine is a state of happiness:
  And yet how gladly could I spare
    Some of the comforts I possess STOP What _you_ call healthy appetite
    _I_ feel as Hungers savage tooth:
  And, when no dinner is in sight,
    The dinner-bells a sound of ruth STOP No scare-crow would accept this coat:
    Such boots as these you seldom see STOP Ah, Paul, a single five-pound-note
    Would make another man of me STOP Said Paul It fills me with surprise
    To hear you talk in such a tone:
  I fear you scarcely realise
    The blessings that are all your own STOP Youre safe from being overfed:
    Youre sweetly picturesque in rags:
  You never know the aching head
    That comes along with money-bags:
  And you have time to cultivate
    That best of qualities, Content
  For which youll find your present state
    Remarkably convenient STOP Said Peter Though I cannot sound
    The depths of such a man as you,
  Yet in your character Ive found
    An inconsistency or two STOP You seem to have long years to spare
    When theres a promise to fulfil:
  And yet how punctual you were
    In calling with that little bill STOP One cant be too deliberate,
    Said Paul, in parting with ones pelf STOP With bills, as you correctly state,
    Im punctuality itself STOP A man may surely claim his dues:
    But, when theres money to be _lent_,
  A man must be allowed to choose
    Such times as are convenient STOP It chanced one day, as Peter sat
    Gnawing a crusthis usual meal
  Paul bustled in to have a chat,
    And grasped his hand with friendly zeal STOP I knew, said he, your frugal ways:
    So, that I might not wound your pride
  By bringing strangers in to gaze,
    Ive left my legal friend outside STOP You well remember, I am sure,
    When first your wealth began to go,
  And people sneered at one so poor,
    _I_ never used my Peter so STOP And when youd lost your little all,
    And found yourself a thing despised,
  I need not ask you to recall
    How tenderly I sympathised STOP Then the advice Ive poured on you,
    So full of wisdom and of wit:
  All given gratis, though tis true
    I might have fairly charged for it STOP But I refrain from mentioning
    Full many a deed I might relate
  For boasting is a kind of thing
  That I particularly hate STOP [Illustration: I WILL LEND YOU FIFTY MORE! STOP How vast the total sum appears
    Of all the kindnesses Ive done,
  From Childhoods half-forgotten years
    Down to that Loan of April One STOP That Fifty Pounds STOP You little guessed
    How deep it drained my slender store:
  But theres a heart within this breast,
    And _I will lend you fifty more_ STOP Not so, was Peters mild reply,
    His cheeks all wet with grateful tears:
  No man recalls, so well as I,
    Your services in bygone years:
  And this new offer, I admit,
    Is very very kindly meant
  Still, to avail myself of it
    Would not be quite convenient STOP Youll see in a moment what the difference is between convenient and
inconvenient STOP You quite understand it now, dont you STOP he added,
looking kindly at Bruno, who was sitting, at Sylvies side, on the
floor STOP Yes, said Bruno, very quietly STOP Such a short speech was very unusual,
for him: but just then he seemed, I fancied, a little exhausted STOP In
fact, he climbed up into Sylvies lap as he spoke, and rested his head
against her shoulder STOP What a many verses it was STOP he whispered STOP  STOP A MUSICAL GARDENER STOP The Other Professor regarded him with some anxiety STOP The smaller animal
ought to go to bed _at once_, he said with an air of authority STOP Why _at once_ STOP said the Professor STOP Because he cant go at twice, said the Other Professor STOP The Professor gently clapped his hands STOP Isnt he _wonderful_ STOP he said
to Sylvie STOP Nobody else could have thought of the reason, so quick STOP Why,
_of course_ he cant go at twice STOP It would hurt him to be divided STOP This remark woke up Bruno, suddenly and completely STOP I dont want to be
_divided_, he said decisively STOP It does very well on a _diagram_, said the Other Professor STOP I could
show it you in a minute, only the chalks a little blunt STOP Take care STOP Sylvie anxiously exclaimed, as he began, rather clumsily,
to point it STOP Youll cut your finger off, if you hold the knife so STOP If oo cuts it off, will oo give it to _me_, please STOP Bruno thoughtfully
added STOP Its like this, said the Other Professor, hastily drawing a long line
upon the black board, and marking the letters _A_, _B_, at the two
ends, and _C_ in the middle: let me explain it to you STOP If _AB_ were
to be divided into two parts at _C_

It would be drownded, Bruno pronounced confidently STOP The Other Professor gasped STOP _What_ would be drownded STOP Why the bumble-bee, of course STOP said Bruno STOP And the two bits would
sink down in the sea STOP Here the Professor interfered, as the Other Professor was evidently too
much puzzled to go on with his diagram STOP When I said it would _hurt_ him, I was merely referring to the action
of the nerves

The Other Professor brightened up in a moment STOP The action of the
nerves, he began eagerly, is curiously slow in some people STOP I had a
friend, once, that, if you burnt him with a red-hot poker, it would take
years and years before he felt it STOP And if you only _pinched_ him STOP queried Sylvie STOP Then it would take ever so much longer, of course STOP In fact, I doubt if
the man _himself_ would ever feel it, at all STOP His grandchildren might STOP I wouldnt like to be the grandchild of a pinched grandfather, would
_you_, Mister Sir STOP Bruno whispered STOP It might come just when you wanted
to be happy STOP That would be awkward, I admitted, taking it quite as a matter of course
that he had so suddenly caught sight of me STOP But dont you _always_ want
to be happy, Bruno STOP Not _always_, Bruno said thoughtfully STOP Sometimes, when Is _too_
happy, I wants to be a little miserable STOP Then I just tell Sylvie about
it, oo know, and Sylvie sets me some lessons STOP Then its all right STOP Im sorry you dont like lessons, I said STOP You should copy Sylvie STOP _Shes_ always as busy as the day is long STOP Well, so am _I_ STOP said Bruno STOP No, no STOP Sylvie corrected him STOP _Youre_ as busy as the day is
_short_ STOP Well, whats the difference STOP Bruno asked STOP Mister Sir, isnt the day
as short as its long STOP I mean, isnt it the _same_ length STOP Never having considered the question in this light, I suggested that
they had better ask the Professor; and they ran off in a moment to
appeal to their old friend STOP The Professor left off polishing his
spectacles to consider STOP My dears, he said after a minute, the day is
the same length as anything that is the same length as _it_ STOP And he
resumed his neverending task of polishing STOP The children returned, slowly and thoughtfully, to report his answer STOP _Isnt_ he wise STOP Sylvie asked in an awestruck whisper STOP If _I_ was as
wise as _that_, I should have a head-ache all day long STOP I _know_ I
should STOP You appear to be talking to somebodythat isnt here, the Professor
said, turning round to the children STOP Who is it STOP Bruno looked puzzled STOP I never talks to nobody when he isnt here STOP he
replied STOP It isnt good manners STOP Oo should always wait till he comes,
before oo talks to him STOP The Professor looked anxiously in my direction, and seemed to look
through and through me without seeing me STOP Then who are you talking to STOP he said STOP There isnt anybody here, you know, except the Other
Professorand _he_ isnt here STOP he added wildly, turning round and round
like a teetotum STOP Children STOP Help to look for him STOP Quick STOP Hes got lost
again STOP The children were on their feet in a moment STOP Where shall we look STOP said Sylvie STOP Anywhere STOP shouted the excited Professor STOP Only be quick about it STOP And
he began trotting round and round the room, lifting up the chairs, and
shaking them STOP Bruno took a very small book out of the bookcase, opened it, and shook
it in imitation of the Professor STOP He isnt _here_, he said STOP He _cant_ be there, Bruno STOP Sylvie said indignantly STOP Course he cant STOP said Bruno STOP I should have shooked him out, if hed
been in there STOP Has he ever been lost before STOP Sylvie enquired, turning up a corner of
the hearth-rug, and peeping under it STOP Once before, said the Professor: he once lost himself in a wood

And couldnt he find his-self again STOP said Bruno STOP Why didnt he shout STOP Hed be sure to hear his-self, cause he couldnt be far off, oo know STOP Lets try shouting, said the Professor STOP What shall we shout STOP said Sylvie STOP On second thoughts, _dont_ shout, the Professor replied STOP The
Vice-Warden might hear you STOP Hes getting awfully strict STOP This reminded the poor children of all the troubles, about which they
had come to their old friend STOP Bruno sat down on the floor and began
crying STOP He _is_ so cruel STOP he sobbed STOP And he lets Uggug take away
_all_ my toys STOP And such horrid meals STOP What did you have for dinner to-day STOP said the Professor STOP A little piece of a dead crow, was Brunos mournful reply STOP He means rook-pie, Sylvie explained STOP It _were_ a dead crow, Bruno persisted STOP And there were a
apple-puddingand Uggug ate it alland I got nuffin but a crust STOP And I
asked for a orangeanddidnt get it STOP And the poor little fellow buried
his face in Sylvies lap, who kept gently stroking his hair, as she went
on STOP Its all true, Professor dear STOP They _do_ treat my darling Bruno
very badly STOP And theyre not kind to _me_ either, she added in a lower
tone, as if _that_ were a thing of much less importance STOP The Professor got out a large red silk handkerchief, and wiped his eyes STOP I wish I could help you, dear children STOP he said STOP But what _can_ I
do STOP We know the way to Fairylandwhere Fathers gonequite well, said
Sylvie: if only the Gardener would let us out STOP Wont he open the door for you STOP said the Professor STOP Not for _us_, said Sylvie: but Im sure he would for _you_ STOP Do come
and ask him, Professor dear STOP Ill come this minute STOP said the Professor STOP Bruno sat up and dried his eyes STOP _Isnt_ he kind, Mister Sir STOP He is _indeed_, said I STOP But the Professor took no notice of my remark STOP He had put on a beautiful cap with a long tassel, and was selecting one
of the Other Professors walking-sticks, from a stand in the corner of
the room STOP A thick stick in ones hand makes people respectful, he was
saying to himself STOP Come along, dear children STOP And we all went out into
the garden together STOP I shall address him, first of all, the Professor explained as we went
along, with a few playful remarks on the weather STOP I shall then question
him about the Other Professor STOP This will have a double advantage STOP First,
it will open the conversation (you cant even drink a bottle of wine
without opening it first): and secondly, if hes seen the Other
Professor, we shall find him that way: and, if he hasnt, we shant STOP On our way, we passed the target, at which Uggug had been made to shoot
during the Ambassadors visit STOP See STOP said the Professor, pointing out a hole in the middle of the
bulls-eye STOP His Imperial Fatness had only _one_ shot at it; and he went
in just _here_ STOP Bruno carefully examined the hole STOP Couldnt go in _there_, he
whispered to me STOP He are too _fat_ STOP We had no sort of difficulty in _finding_ the Gardener STOP Though he was
hidden from us by some trees, that harsh voice of his served to direct
us; and, as we drew nearer, the words of his song became more and more
plainly audible:

  He thought he saw an Albatross
    That fluttered round the lamp:
  He looked again, and found it was
    A Penny-Postage-Stamp STOP Youd best be getting home, he said:
    The nights are very damp STOP [Illustration: HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ALBATROSS]

Would it be afraid of catching cold STOP said Bruno STOP If it got _very_ damp, Sylvie suggested, it might stick to something,
you know STOP And _that_ somefin would have to go by the post, whatever it was STOP Bruno eagerly exclaimed STOP Suppose it was a cow STOP Wouldnt it be
_dreadful_ for the other things STOP And all these things happened to _him_, said the Professor STOP Thats
what makes the song so interesting STOP He must have had a very curious life, said Sylvie STOP You may say that STOP the Professor heartily rejoined STOP Of course she may STOP cried Bruno STOP By this time we had come up to the Gardener, who was standing on one
leg, as usual, and busily employed in watering a bed of flowers with an
empty watering-can STOP It hasnt got no water in it STOP Bruno explained to him, pulling his
sleeve to attract his attention STOP Its lighter to hold, said the Gardener STOP A lot of water in it makes
ones arms ache STOP And he went on with his work, singing softly to
himself

  The nights are very damp STOP In digging things out of the groundwhich you probably do now and
then, the Professor began in a loud voice; in making things into
heapswhich no doubt you often do; and in kicking things about with one
heelwhich you seem never to leave off doing; have you ever happened to
notice another Professor, something like me, but different STOP Never STOP shouted the Gardener, so loudly and violently that we all drew
back in alarm STOP There aint such a thing STOP We will try a less exciting topic, the Professor mildly remarked to
the children STOP You were asking

We asked him to let us through the garden-door, said Sylvie: but he
wouldnt: but perhaps he would for _you_ STOP The Professor put the request, very humbly and courteously STOP I wouldnt mind letting _you_ out, said the Gardener STOP But I mustnt
open the door for _children_ STOP Dyou think Id disobey the _Rules_ STOP Not
for one-and-sixpence STOP The Professor cautiously produced a couple of shillings STOP Thatll do it STOP the Gardener shouted, as he hurled the watering-can
across the flower-bed, and produced a handful of keysone large one, and
a number of small ones STOP But look here, Professor dear STOP whispered Sylvie STOP He neednt open the
door for _us_, at all STOP We can go out with _you_ STOP True, dear child STOP the Professor thankfully replied, as he replaced the
coins in his pocket STOP That saves two shillings STOP And he took the
childrens hands, that they might all go out together when the door was
opened STOP This, however, did not seem a very likely event, though the
Gardener patiently tried all the small keys, over and over again STOP At last the Professor ventured on a gentle suggestion STOP Why not try the
_large_ one STOP I have often observed that a door unlocks _much_ more
nicely with its _own_ key STOP The very first trial of the large key proved a success: the Gardener
opened the door, and held out his hand for the money STOP The Professor shook his head STOP You are acting by _Rule_, he explained,
in opening the door for _me_ STOP And now its open, we are going out by
_Rule_the Rule of _Three_ STOP The Gardener looked puzzled, and let us go out; but, as he locked the
door behind us, we heard him singing thoughtfully to himself

  He thought he saw a Garden-Door
    That opened with a key:
  He looked again, and found it was
    A Double Rule of Three:
  And all its mystery, he said,
    Is clear as day to me STOP I shall now return, said the Professor, when we had walked a few
yards: you see, its impossible to read _here_, for all my books are in
the house STOP But the children still kept fast hold of his hands STOP _Do_ come with us STOP Sylvie entreated with tears in her eyes STOP Well, well STOP said the good-natured old man STOP Perhaps Ill come after
you, some day soon STOP But I _must_ go back _now_ STOP You see I left off at a
comma, and its so awkward not knowing how the sentence finishes STOP Besides, youve got to go through Dogland first, and Im always a little
nervous about dogs STOP But itll be quite easy to come, as soon as Ive
completed my new inventionfor carrying ones-_self_, you know STOP It wants
just a _little_ more working-out STOP Wont that be very tiring, to carry _yourself_ STOP Sylvie enquired STOP Well, no, my child STOP You see, whatever fatigue one incurs by _carrying_,
one saves by _being carried_ STOP Good-bye, dears STOP Good-bye, Sir STOP he added
to my intense surprise, giving my hand an affectionate squeeze STOP Good-bye, Professor STOP I replied: but my voice sounded strange and far
away, and the children took not the slightest notice of our farewell STOP Evidently they neither saw me nor heard me, as, with their arms lovingly
twined round each other, they marched boldly on STOP  STOP A VISIT TO DOGLAND STOP Theres a house, away there to the left, said Sylvie, after we had
walked what seemed to me about fifty miles STOP Lets go and ask for a
nights lodging STOP It looks a very comfable house, Bruno said, as we turned into the road
leading up to it STOP I doos hope the Dogs will be kind to us, I _is_ so
tired and hungry STOP A Mastiff, dressed in a scarlet collar, and carrying a musket, was
pacing up and down, like a sentinel, in front of the entrance STOP He
started, on catching sight of the children, and came forwards to meet
them, keeping his musket pointed straight at Bruno, who stood quite
still, though he turned pale and kept tight hold of Sylvies hand, while
the Sentinel walked solemnly round and round them, and looked at them
from all points of view STOP [Illustration: THE MASTIFF-SENTINEL]

Oobooh, hooh boohooyah STOP He growled at last STOP Woobah yahwah oobooh STOP Bow
wahbah woobooyah STOP Bow wow STOP he asked Bruno, severely STOP Of course _Bruno_ understood all this, easily enough STOP All Fairies
understand Doggeethat is, Dog-language STOP But, as _you_ may find it a
little difficult, just at first, I had better put it into English for
you STOP Humans, I verily believe STOP A couple of stray Humans STOP What Dog do
you belong to STOP What do you want STOP We dont belong to a _Dog_ STOP Bruno began, in Doggee STOP (Peoples _never_
belongs to Dogs STOP he whispered to Sylvie. STOP But Sylvie hastily checked him, for fear of hurting the Mastiffs
feelings STOP Please, we want a little food, and a nights lodgingif
theres room in the house, she added timidly STOP Sylvie spoke Doggee very
prettily: but I think its almost better, for _you_, to give the
conversation in English STOP The _house_, indeed STOP growled the Sentinel STOP Have you never seen a
_Palace_ in your life STOP Come along with me STOP His Majesty must settle
whats to be done with you STOP They followed him through the entrance-hall, down a long passage, and
into a magnificent Saloon, around which were grouped dogs of all sorts
and sizes STOP Two splendid Blood-hounds were solemnly sitting up, one on
each side of the crown-bearer STOP Two or three Bull-dogswhom I guessed to
be the Body-Guard of the Kingwere waiting in grim silence: in fact the
only voices at all plainly audible were those of two little dogs, who
had mounted a settee, and were holding a lively discussion that looked
very like a quarrel STOP Lords and Ladies in Waiting, and various Court Officials, our guide
gruffly remarked, as he led us in STOP Of _me_ the Courtiers took no notice
whatever: but Sylvie and Bruno were the subject of many inquisitive
looks, and many whispered remarks, of which I only distinctly caught
_one_made by a sly-looking Dachshund to his friendBah wooh wahyah
hoobah Oobooh, _hah_ bah STOP (Shes not such a bad-looking Human, _is_
she? STOP Leaving the new arrivals in the centre of the Saloon, the Sentinel
advanced to a door, at the further end of it, which bore an inscription,
painted on it in Doggee, Royal KennelScratch and Yell STOP Before doing this, the Sentinel turned to the children, and said Give
me your names STOP Wed rather not STOP Bruno exclaimed, pulling Sylvie away from the door STOP We want them ourselves STOP Come back, Sylvie STOP Come quick STOP Nonsense STOP said Sylvie very decidedly: and gave their names in Doggee STOP Then the Sentinel scratched violently at the door, and gave a yell that
made Bruno shiver from head to foot STOP Hooyah wah STOP said a deep voice inside STOP (Thats Doggee for Come in! STOP Its the King himself STOP the Mastiff whispered in an awestruck tone STOP Take off your wigs, and lay them humbly at his paws STOP (What _we_ should
call at his _feet_. STOP Sylvie was just going to explain, very politely, that really they
_couldnt_ perform _that_ ceremony, because their wigs wouldnt come
off, when the door of the Royal Kennel opened, and an enormous
Newfoundland Dog put his head out STOP Bow wow STOP was his first question STOP When His Majesty speaks to you, the Sentinel hastily whispered to
Bruno, you should prick up your ears STOP Bruno looked doubtfully at Sylvie STOP Id rather not, please, he said STOP It would hurt STOP [Illustration: THE DOG-KING]

It doesnt hurt a bit STOP the Sentinel said with some indignation STOP Look STOP Its like this STOP And he pricked up his ears like two railway signals STOP Sylvie gently explained matters STOP Im afraid we cant manage it, she
said in a low voice STOP Im very sorry: but our ears havent got the
right she wanted to say machinery in Doggee: but she had forgotten
the word, and could only think of steam-engine STOP The Sentinel repeated Sylvies explanation to the King STOP Cant prick up their ears without a steam-engine STOP His Majesty
exclaimed STOP They _must_ be curious creatures STOP I must have a look at
them STOP And he came out of his Kennel, and walked solemnly up to the
children STOP What was the amazementnot to say the horrorof the whole assembly, when
Sylvie actually _patted His Majesty on the head_, while Bruno seized his
long ears and pretended to tie them together under his chin STOP The Sentinel groaned aloud: a beautiful Greyhoundwho appeared to be one
of the Ladies in Waitingfainted away: and all the other Courtiers
hastily drew back, and left plenty of room for the huge Newfoundland to
spring upon the audacious strangers, and tear them limb from limb STOP Onlyhe didnt STOP On the contrary his Majesty actually _smiled_so far as
a Dog _can_ smileand (the other Dogs couldnt believe their eyes, but
it was true, all the same) his Majesty _wagged his tail_ STOP Yah STOP Hooh hahwooh STOP (that is Well STOP I never! STOP was the universal cry STOP His Majesty looked round him severely, and gave a slight growl, which
produced instant silence STOP Conduct _my friends_ to the banqueting-hall STOP he said, laying such an emphasis on _my friends_ that several of the
dogs rolled over helplessly on their backs and began to lick Brunos
feet STOP A procession was formed, but I only ventured to follow as far as the
_door_ of the banqueting-hall, so furious was the uproar of barking dogs
within STOP So I sat down by the King, who seemed to have gone to sleep, and
waited till the children returned to say good-night, when His Majesty
got up and shook himself STOP Time for bed STOP he said with a sleepy yawn STOP The attendants will show
you your room, he added, aside, to Sylvie and Bruno STOP Bring lights STOP And, with a dignified air, he held out his paw for them to kiss STOP But the children were evidently not well practised in Court-manners STOP Sylvie simply stroked the great paw: Bruno hugged it: the Master of the
Ceremonies looked shocked STOP All this time Dog-waiters, in splendid livery, were running up with
lighted candles: but, as fast as they put them upon the table, other
waiters ran away with them, so that there never seemed to be one for
_me_, though the Master kept nudging me with his elbow, and repeating I
cant let you sleep _here_ STOP Youre not in _bed_, you know STOP I made a great effort, and just succeeded in getting out the words I
know Im not STOP Im in an arm-chair STOP Well, forty winks will do you no harm, the Master said, and left me STOP I
could scarcely hear his words: and no wonder: he was leaning over the
side of a ship, that was miles away from the pier on which I stood STOP The
ship passed over the horizon, and I sank back into the arm-chair STOP The next thing I remember is that it was morning: breakfast was just
over: Sylvie was lifting Bruno down from a high chair, and saying to a
Spaniel, who was regarding them with a most benevolent smile, Yes,
thank you, weve had a _very_ nice breakfast STOP Havent we, Bruno STOP There was too many bones in the Bruno began, but Sylvie frowned at
him, and laid her finger on her lips, for, at this moment, the travelers
were waited on by a very dignified officer, the Head-Growler, whose duty
it was, first to conduct them to the King to bid him farewell, and then
to escort them to the boundary of Dogland STOP The great Newfoundland
received them most affably, but, instead of saying good-bye, he
startled the Head-Growler into giving three savage growls, by announcing
that he would escort them himself STOP It is a most unusual proceeding, your Majesty STOP the Head-Growler
exclaimed, almost choking with vexation at being set aside, for he had
put on his best Court-suit, made entirely of cat-skins, for the
occasion STOP I shall escort them myself, his Majesty repeated, gently but firmly,
laying aside the Royal robes, and changing his crown for a small
coronet, and you may stay at home STOP I _are_ glad STOP Bruno whispered to Sylvie, when they had got well out of
hearing STOP He were so _welly_ cross STOP And he not only patted their Royal
escort, but even hugged him round the neck in the exuberance of his
delight STOP His Majesty calmly wagged the Royal tail STOP Its quite a relief, he
said, getting away from that Palace now and then STOP Royal Dogs have a
dull life of it, I can tell you STOP Would you mind (this to Sylvie, in a
low voice, and looking a little shy and embarrassed) would you mind the
trouble of just throwing that stick for me to fetch STOP Sylvie was too much astonished to do anything for a moment: it sounded
such a monstrous impossibility that a _King_ should wish to run after a
stick STOP But _Bruno_ was equal to the occasion, and with a glad shout of
Hi then STOP Fetch it, good Doggie STOP he hurled it over a clump of bushes STOP The next moment the Monarch of Dogland had bounded over the bushes, and
picked up the stick, and came galloping back to the children with it in
his mouth STOP Bruno took it from him with great decision STOP Beg for it STOP he
insisted; and His Majesty begged STOP Paw STOP commanded Sylvie; and His
Majesty gave his paw STOP In short, the solemn ceremony of escorting the
travelers to the boundaries of Dogland became one long uproarious game
of play STOP But business is business STOP the Dog-King said at last STOP And I must go
back to mine STOP I couldnt come any further, he added, consulting a
dog-watch, which hung on a chain round his neck, not even if there were
a _Cat_ in sight STOP They took an affectionate farewell of His Majesty, and trudged on STOP That _were_ a dear dog STOP Bruno exclaimed STOP Has we to go far, Sylvie STOP Is tired STOP Not much further, darling STOP Sylvie gently replied STOP Do you see that
shining, just beyond those trees STOP Im almost _sure_ its the gate of
Fairyland STOP I know its all goldenFather told me soand so bright, so
bright STOP she went on dreamily STOP It dazzles STOP said Bruno, shading his eyes with one little hand, while
the other clung tightly to Sylvies hand, as if he were half-alarmed at
her strange manner STOP For the child moved on as if walking in her sleep, her large eyes gazing
into the far distance, and her breath coming and going in quick pantings
of eager delight STOP I knew, by some mysterious mental light, that a great
change was taking place in my sweet little friend (for such I loved to
think her) and that she was passing from the condition of a mere Outland
Sprite into the true Fairy-nature STOP Upon Bruno the change came later: but it was completed in both before
they reached the golden gate, through which I knew it would be
impossible for _me_ to follow STOP I could but stand outside, and take a
last look at the two sweet children, ere they disappeared within, and
the golden gate closed with a bang STOP And with _such_ a bang STOP It never _will_ shut like any other
cupboard-door, Arthur explained STOP Theres something wrong with the
hinge STOP However, heres the cake and wine STOP And youve had your forty
winks STOP So you really _must_ get off to bed, old man STOP Youre fit for
nothing else STOP Witness my hand, Arthur Forester, M.D STOP By this time I was wide-awake again STOP Not _quite_ yet STOP I pleaded STOP Really Im not sleepy now STOP And it isnt midnight yet STOP Well, I did want to say another word to you, Arthur replied in a
relenting tone, as he supplied me with the supper he had prescribed STOP Only I thought you were too sleepy for it to-night STOP We took our midnight meal almost in silence; for an unusual nervousness
seemed to have seized on my old friend STOP What kind of a night is it STOP he asked, rising and undrawing the
window-curtains, apparently to change the subject for a minute STOP I
followed him to the window, and we stood together, looking out, in
silence STOP When I first spoke to you about Arthur began, after a long and
embarrassing silence, that is, when we first talked about herfor I
think it was _you_ that introduced the subjectmy own position in life
forbade me to do more than worship her from a distance: and I was
turning over plans for leaving this place finally, and settling
somewhere out of all chance of meeting her again STOP That seemed to be my
only chance of usefulness in life STOP Would that have been wise STOP I said STOP To leave yourself no hope at all STOP There _was_ no hope to leave, Arthur firmly replied, though his eyes
glittered with tears as he gazed upwards into the midnight sky, from
which one solitary star, the glorious Vega, blazed out in fitful
splendour through the driving clouds STOP She was like that star to
mebright, beautiful, and pure, but out of reach, out of reach STOP He drew the curtains again, and we returned to our places by the
fireside STOP What I wanted to tell you was this, he resumed STOP I heard this evening
from my solicitor STOP I cant go into the details of the business, but the
upshot is that my worldly wealth is much more than I thought, and I am
(or shall soon be) in a position to offer marriage, without imprudence,
to any lady, even if she brought nothing STOP I doubt if there would be
anything on _her_ side: the Earl is poor, I believe STOP But I should have
enough for both, even if health failed STOP I wish you all happiness in your married life STOP I cried STOP Shall you
speak to the Earl to-morrow STOP Not yet awhile, said Arthur STOP He is very friendly, but I dare not
think he means more than that, as yet STOP And as foras for Lady Muriel,
try as I may, I _cannot_ read her feelings towards me STOP If there _is_
love, she is hiding it STOP No, I must wait, I must wait STOP I did not like to press any further advice on my friend, whose judgment,
I felt, was so much more sober and thoughtful than my own; and we parted
without more words on the subject that had now absorbed his thoughts,
nay, his very life STOP The next morning a letter from _my_ solicitor arrived, summoning me to
town on important business STOP  STOP FAIRY-SYLVIE STOP For a full month the business, for which I had returned to London,
detained me there: and even then it was only the urgent advice of my
physician that induced me to leave it unfinished and pay another visit
to Elveston STOP Arthur had written once or twice during the month; but in none of his
letters was there any mention of Lady Muriel STOP Still, I did not augur ill
from his silence: to me it looked like the natural action of a lover,
who, even while his heart was singing She is mine!, would fear to
paint his happiness in the cold phrases of a written letter, but would
wait to tell it by word of mouth STOP Yes, I thought, I am to hear his
song of triumph from his own lips STOP The night I arrived we had much to say on other matters: and, tired with
the journey, I went to bed early, leaving the happy secret still untold STOP Next day, however, as we chatted on over the remains of luncheon, I
ventured to put the momentous question STOP Well, old friend, you have told
me nothing of Lady Murielnor when the happy day is to be STOP The happy day, Arthur said, looking unexpectedly grave, is yet in the
dim future STOP We need to knowor, rather, _she_ needs to know _me_ better STOP I know _her_ sweet nature, thoroughly, by this time STOP But I dare not
speak till I am sure that my love is returned STOP Dont wait too long STOP I said gaily STOP Faint heart never won fair lady STOP It _is_ faint heart, perhaps STOP But really I _dare_ not speak just
yet STOP But meanwhile, I pleaded, you are running a risk that perhaps you
have not thought of STOP Some other man

No, said Arthur firmly STOP She is heart-whole: I am sure of that STOP Yet,
if she loves another better than me, so be it STOP I will not spoil her
happiness STOP The secret shall die with me STOP But she is my firstand my
_only_ love STOP That is all very beautiful _sentiment_, I said, but it is not
_practical_ STOP It is not like _you_ STOP He either fears his fate too much,
    Or his desert is small,
  Who dares not put it to the touch,
    To win or lose it all STOP I _dare_ not ask the question whether there is another STOP he said
passionately STOP It would break my heart to know it STOP Yet is it wise to leave it unasked STOP You must not waste your life upon
an if STOP I tell you I _dare_ not STOP May _I_ find it out for you STOP I asked, with the freedom of an old
friend STOP No, no STOP he replied with a pained look STOP I entreat you to say nothing STOP Let it wait STOP As you please, I said: and judged it best to say no more just then STOP But this evening, I thought, I will call on the Earl STOP I may be able
to _see_ how the land lies, without so much as saying a word STOP It was a very hot afternoontoo hot to go for a walk or do anythingor
else it wouldnt have happened, I believe STOP In the first place, I want to knowdear Child who reads this!why
Fairies should always be teaching _us_ to do our duty, and lecturing
_us_ when we go wrong, and we should never teach _them_ anything STOP You
cant mean to say that Fairies are never greedy, or selfish, or cross,
or deceitful, because that would be nonsense, you know STOP Well then, dont
you think they might be all the better for a little lecturing and
punishing now and then STOP I really dont see why it shouldnt be tried, and Im almost sure that,
if you could only catch a Fairy, and put it in the corner, and give it
nothing but bread and water for a day or two, youd find it quite an
improved characterit would take down its conceit a little, at all
events STOP The next question is, what is the best time for seeing Fairies STOP I
believe I can tell you all about that STOP The first rule is, that it must be a _very_ hot daythat we may consider
as settled: and you must be just a _little_ sleepybut not too sleepy to
keep your eyes open, mind STOP Well, and you ought to feel a littlewhat one
may call fairyishthe Scotch call it eerie, and perhaps thats a
prettier word; if you dont know what it means, Im afraid I can hardly
explain it; you must wait till you meet a Fairy, and then youll know STOP And the last rule is, that the crickets should not be chirping STOP I cant
stop to explain that: you must take it on trust for the present STOP So, if all these things happen together, you have a good chance of
seeing a Fairyor at least a much better chance than if they didnt STOP The first thing I noticed, as I went lazily along through an open place
in the wood, was a large Beetle lying struggling on its back, and I went
down upon one knee to help the poor thing to its feet again STOP In some
things, you know, you cant be quite sure what an insect would like: for
instance, I never could quite settle, supposing I were a moth, whether I
would rather be kept out of the candle, or be allowed to fly straight in
and get burntor again, supposing I were a spider, Im not sure if I
should be _quite_ pleased to have my web torn down, and the fly let
loosebut I feel quite certain that, if I were a beetle and had rolled
over on my back, I should always be glad to be helped up again STOP So, as I was saying, I had gone down upon one knee, and was just
reaching out a little stick to turn the Beetle over, when I saw a sight
that made me draw back hastily and hold my breath, for fear of making
any noise and frightening the little creature away STOP Not that she looked as if she would be easily frightened: she seemed so
good and gentle that Im sure she would never expect that any one could
wish to hurt her STOP She was only a few inches high, and was dressed in
green, so that you really would hardly have noticed her among the long
grass; and she was so delicate and graceful that she quite seemed to
belong to the place, almost as if she were one of the flowers STOP I may
tell you, besides, that she had no wings (I dont believe in Fairies
with wings), and that she had quantities of long brown hair and large
earnest brown eyes, and then I shall have done all I can to give you an
idea of her STOP [Illustration: FAIRY-SYLVIE]

Sylvie (I found out her name afterwards) had knelt down, just as I was
doing, to help the Beetle; but it needed more than a little stick for
_her_ to get it on its legs again; it was as much as she could do, with
both arms, to roll the heavy thing over; and all the while she was
talking to it, half scolding and half comforting, as a nurse might do
with a child that had fallen down STOP There, there STOP You neednt cry so much about it STOP Youre not killed
yetthough if you were, you couldnt cry, you know, and so its a
general rule against crying, my dear STOP And how did you come to tumble
over STOP But I can see well enough how it wasI neednt ask you
thatwalking over sand-pits with your chin in the air, as usual STOP Of
course if you go among sand-pits like that, you must expect to tumble STOP You should look STOP The Beetle murmured something that sounded like I _did_ look, and
Sylvie went on again STOP But I know you didnt STOP You never do STOP You always walk with your chin
upyoure so dreadfully conceited STOP Well, lets see how many legs are
broken this time STOP Why, none of them, I declare STOP And whats the good of
having six legs, my dear, if you can only kick them all about in the air
when you tumble STOP Legs are meant to walk with, you know STOP Now dont begin
putting out your wings yet; Ive more to say STOP Go to the frog that lives
behind that buttercupgive him my complimentsSylvies complimentscan
you say compliments STOP The Beetle tried and, I suppose, succeeded STOP Yes, thats right STOP And tell him hes to give you some of that salve I
left with him yesterday STOP And youd better get him to rub it in for you STOP Hes got rather cold hands, but you mustnt mind that STOP I think the Beetle must have shuddered at this idea, for Sylvie went on
in a graver tone STOP Now you neednt pretend to be so particular as all
that, as if you were too grand to be rubbed by a frog STOP The fact is, you
ought to be very much obliged to him STOP Suppose you could get nobody but a
toad to do it, how would you like _that_ STOP There was a little pause, and then Sylvie added Now you may go STOP Be a
good beetle, and dont keep your chin in the air STOP And then began one of
those performances of humming, and whizzing, and restless banging about,
such as a beetle indulges in when it has decided on flying, but hasnt
quite made up its mind which way to go STOP At last, in one of its awkward
zig-zags, it managed to fly right into my face, and, by the time I had
recovered from the shock, the little Fairy was gone STOP I looked about in all directions for the little creature, but there was
no trace of herand my eerie feeling was quite gone off, and the
crickets were chirping again merrilyso I knew she was really gone STOP And now Ive got time to tell you the rule about the crickets STOP They
always leave off chirping when a Fairy goes bybecause a Fairys a kind
of queen over them, I supposeat all events its a much grander thing
than a cricketso whenever youre walking out, and the crickets suddenly
leave off chirping, you may be sure that they see a Fairy STOP I walked on sadly enough, you may be sure STOP However, I comforted myself
with thinking Its been a very wonderful afternoon, so far STOP Ill just
go quietly on and look about me, and I shouldnt wonder if I were to
come across another Fairy somewhere STOP Peering about in this way, I happened to notice a plant with rounded
leaves, and with queer little holes cut in the middle of several of
them STOP Ah, the leafcutter bee STOP I carelessly remarkedyou know I am very
learned in Natural History (for instance, I can always tell kittens from
chickens at one glance)and I was passing on, when a sudden thought made
me stoop down and examine the leaves STOP Then a little thrill of delight ran through mefor I noticed that the
holes were all arranged so as to form letters; there were three leaves
side by side, with B, R, and U marked on them, and after some
search I found two more, which contained an N and an O STOP And then, all in a moment, a flash of inner light seemed to illumine a
part of my life that had all but faded into oblivionthe strange visions
I had experienced during my journey to Elveston: and with a thrill of
delight I thought Those visions are destined to be linked with my
waking life STOP By this time the eerie feeling had come back again, and I suddenly
observed that no crickets were chirping; so I felt quite sure that
Bruno was somewhere very near STOP And so indeed he wasso near that I had very nearly walked over him
without seeing him; which would have been dreadful, always supposing
that Fairies _can_ be walked overmy own belief is that they are
something of the nature of Will-o-the-Wisps: and theres no walking
over _them_ STOP Think of any pretty little boy you know, with rosy cheeks, large dark
eyes, and tangled brown hair, and then fancy him made small enough to go
comfortably into a coffee-cup, and youll have a very fair idea of him STOP Whats your name, little one STOP I began, in as soft a voice as I could
manage STOP And, by the way, why is it we always begin by asking little
children their names STOP Is it because we fancy a name will help to make
them a little bigger STOP You never thought of asking a real large man his
name, now, did you STOP But, however that may be, I felt it quite necessary
to know _his_ name; so, as he didnt answer my question, I asked it
again a little louder STOP Whats your name, my little man STOP Whats oors STOP he said, without looking up STOP I told him my name quite gently, for he was much too small to be angry
with STOP Duke of Anything STOP he asked, just looking at me for a moment, and then
going on with his work STOP Not Duke at all, I said, a little ashamed of having to confess it STOP Oore big enough to be two Dukes, said the little creature STOP I suppose
oore Sir Something, then STOP No, I said, feeling more and more ashamed STOP I havent got any title STOP The Fairy seemed to think that in that case I really wasnt worth the
trouble of talking to, for he quietly went on digging, and tearing the
flowers to pieces STOP After a few minutes I tried again STOP _Please_ tell me what your name is STOP Bruno, the little fellow answered, very readily STOP Why didnt oo say
please before STOP Thats something like what we used to be taught in the nursery, I
thought to myself, looking back through the long years (about a hundred
of them, since you ask the question), to the time when I was a little
child STOP And here an idea came into my head, and I asked him Arent you
one of the Fairies that teach children to be good STOP Well, we have to do that sometimes, said Bruno, and a dreadful bother
it is STOP As he said this, he savagely tore a heartsease in two, and
trampled on the pieces STOP What _are_ you doing there, Bruno STOP I said STOP Spoiling Sylvies garden, was all the answer Bruno would give at
first STOP But, as he went on tearing up the flowers, he muttered to himself
The nasty cross thingwouldnt let me go and play this morning,said I
must finish my lessons firstlessons, indeed STOP Ill vex her finely,
though STOP Oh, Bruno, you shouldnt do that STOP I cried STOP Dont you know thats
revenge STOP And revenge is a wicked, cruel, dangerous thing STOP River-edge STOP said Bruno STOP What a funny word STOP I suppose oo call it cruel
and dangerous cause, if oo wented too far and tumbleded in, ood get
drownded STOP No, not river-edge, I explained: re-venge (saying the word very
slowly) STOP But I couldnt help thinking that Brunos explanation did very
well for either word STOP Oh STOP said Bruno, opening his eyes very wide, but without trying to
repeat the word STOP Come STOP Try and pronounce it, Bruno STOP I said, cheerfully STOP Re-venge,
re-venge STOP But Bruno only tossed his little head, and said he couldnt; that his
mouth wasnt the right shape for words of that kind STOP And the more I
laughed, the more sulky the little fellow got about it STOP Well, never mind, my little man STOP I said STOP Shall I help you with that
job STOP Yes, please, Bruno said, quite pacified STOP Only I wiss I could think of
somefin to vex her more than this STOP Oo dont know how hard it is to make
her angry STOP Now listen to me, Bruno, and Ill teach you quite a splendid kind of
revenge STOP Somefin thatll vex her finely STOP he asked with gleaming eyes STOP Something that will vex her finely STOP First, well get up all the weeds
in her garden STOP See, there are a good many at this endquite hiding the
flowers STOP But _that_ wont vex her STOP said Bruno STOP After that, I said, without noticing the remark, well water this
highest bedup here STOP You see its getting quite dry and dusty STOP Bruno looked at me inquisitively, but he said nothing this time STOP Then after that, I went on, the walks want sweeping a bit; and I
think you might cut down that tall nettleits so close to the garden
that its quite in the way

What _is_ oo talking about STOP Bruno impatiently interrupted me STOP All
that wont vex her a bit STOP Wont it STOP I said, innocently STOP Then, after that, suppose we put in
some of these coloured pebblesjust to mark the divisions between the
different kinds of flowers, you know STOP Thatll have a very pretty
effect STOP Bruno turned round and had another good stare at me STOP At last there came
an odd little twinkle into his eyes, and he said, with quite a new
meaning in his voice, Thatll do nicely STOP Lets put em in rowsall the
red together, and all the blue together STOP Thatll do capitally, I said; and thenwhat kind of flowers does
Sylvie like best STOP Bruno had to put his thumb in his mouth and consider a little before he
could answer STOP Violets, he said, at last STOP Theres a beautiful bed of violets down by the brook

Oh, lets fetch em STOP cried Bruno, giving a little skip into the air STOP Here STOP Catch hold of my hand, and Ill help oo along STOP The grass is
rather thick down that way STOP I couldnt help laughing at his having so entirely forgotten what a big
creature he was talking to STOP No, not yet, Bruno, I said: we must
consider whats the right thing to do first STOP You see weve got quite a
business before us STOP Yes, lets consider, said Bruno, putting his thumb into his mouth
again, and sitting down upon a dead mouse STOP What do you keep that mouse for STOP I said STOP You should either bury it,
or else throw it into the brook STOP Why, its to measure with STOP cried Bruno STOP How ever would oo do a garden
without one STOP We make each bed three mouses and a half long, and two
mouses wide STOP I stopped him, as he was dragging it off by the tail to show me how it
was used, for I was half afraid the eerie feeling might go off before
we had finished the garden, and in that case I should see no more of him
or Sylvie STOP I think the best way will be for _you_ to weed the beds,
while _I_ sort out these pebbles, ready to mark the walks with STOP Thats it STOP cried Bruno STOP And Ill tell oo about the caterpillars while
we work STOP Ah, lets hear about the caterpillars, I said, as I drew the pebbles
together into a heap and began dividing them into colours STOP And Bruno went on in a low, rapid tone, more as if he were talking to
himself STOP Yesterday I saw two little caterpillars, when I was sitting by
the brook, just where oo go into the wood STOP They were quite green, and
they had yellow eyes, and they didnt see _me_ STOP And one of them had got
a moths wing to carrya great brown moths wing, oo know, all dry, with
feathers STOP So he couldnt want it to eat, I should thinkperhaps he meant
to make a cloak for the winter STOP Perhaps, I said, for Bruno had twisted up the last word into a sort of
question, and was looking at me for an answer STOP One word was quite enough for the little fellow, and he went on merrily STOP Well, and so he didnt want the other caterpillar to see the moths
wing, oo knowso what must he do but try to carry it with all his left
legs, and he tried to walk on the other set STOP Of course he toppled over
after that STOP After what STOP I said, catching at the last word, for, to tell the truth,
I hadnt been attending much STOP He toppled over, Bruno repeated, very gravely, and if _oo_ ever saw a
caterpillar topple over, ood know its a welly serious thing, and not
sit grinning like thatand I shant tell oo no more STOP Indeed and indeed, Bruno, I didnt mean to grin STOP See, Im quite grave
again now STOP But Bruno only folded his arms, and said Dont tell _me_ STOP I see a
little twinkle in one of oor eyesjust like the moon STOP Why do you think Im like the moon, Bruno STOP I asked STOP Oor face is large and round like the moon, Bruno answered, looking at
me thoughtfully STOP It doosnt shine quite so brightbut its more
cleaner STOP I couldnt help smiling at this STOP You know I sometimes wash _my_ face,
Bruno STOP The moon never does that STOP Oh, doosnt she though STOP cried Bruno; and he leant forwards and added
in a solemn whisper, The moons face gets dirtier and dirtier every
night, till its black all across STOP And then, when its dirty all
over_so_ (he passed his hand across his own rosy cheeks as he spoke)
then she washes it STOP Then its all clean again, isnt it STOP Not all in a moment, said Bruno STOP What a deal of teaching oo wants STOP She washes it little by littleonly she begins at the other edge, oo
know STOP By this time he was sitting quietly on the dead mouse with his arms
folded, and the weeding wasnt getting on a bit: so I had to say Work
first, pleasure afterwards: no more talking till that beds finished STOP  STOP BRUNOS REVENGE STOP After that we had a few minutes of silence, while I sorted out the
pebbles, and amused myself with watching Brunos plan of gardening STOP It
was quite a new plan to me: he always measured each bed before he weeded
it, as if he was afraid the weeding would make it shrink; and once, when
it came out longer than he wished, he set to work to thump the mouse
with his little fist, crying out There now STOP Its all gone wrong again STOP Why dont oo keep oor tail straight when I tell oo STOP Ill tell you what Ill do, Bruno said in a half-whisper, as we
worked STOP Oo like Fairies, dont oo STOP Yes, I said: of course I do, or I shouldnt have come here STOP I should
have gone to some place where there are no Fairies STOP Bruno laughed contemptuously STOP Why, oo might as well say ood go to some
place where there wasnt any airsupposing oo didnt like air STOP This was a rather difficult idea to grasp STOP I tried a change of subject STOP Youre nearly the first Fairy I ever saw STOP Have _you_ ever seen any
people besides me STOP Plenty STOP said Bruno STOP We see em when we walk in the road STOP But they cant see _you_ STOP How is it they never tread on you STOP Cant _tread_ on us, said Bruno, looking amused at my ignorance STOP Why, suppose oore walking, hereso (making little marks on the
ground) and suppose theres a Fairythats mewalking _here_ STOP Very well
then, oo put one foot here, and one foot here, so oo doosnt tread on
the Fairy STOP This was all very well as an explanation, but it didnt convince me STOP Why shouldnt I put one foot _on_ the Fairy STOP I asked STOP I dont know _why_, the little fellow said in a thoughtful tone STOP But
I know oo _wouldnt_ STOP Nobody never walked on the top of a Fairy STOP Now
Ill tell oo what Ill do, as oore so fond of Fairies STOP Ill get oo an
invitation to the Fairy-Kings dinner-party STOP I know one of the
head-waiters STOP I couldnt help laughing at this idea STOP Do the waiters invite the
guests STOP I asked STOP Oh, not _to sit down_ STOP Bruno said STOP But to wait at table STOP Ood like
that, wouldnt oo STOP To hand about plates, and so on STOP Well, but thats not so nice as sitting at the table, is it STOP Of course it isnt, Bruno said, in a tone as if he rather pitied my
ignorance; but if oore not even Sir Anything, oo cant expect to be
allowed to sit at the table, oo know STOP I said, as meekly as I could, that I didnt expect it, but it was the
only way of going to a dinner-party that I really enjoyed STOP And Bruno
tossed his head, and said, in a rather offended tone, that I might do as
I pleasedthere were many he knew that would give their ears to go STOP Have you ever been yourself, Bruno STOP They invited me once, last week, Bruno said, very gravely STOP It was to
wash up the soup-platesno, the cheese-plates I meanthat was grand
enough STOP And I waited at table STOP And I didnt hardly make only _one_
mistake STOP What was it STOP I said STOP You neednt mind telling _me_ STOP Only bringing scissors to cut the beef with, Bruno said carelessly STOP But the grandest thing of all was, _I_ fetched the King a glass of
cider STOP That _was_ grand STOP I said, biting my lip to keep myself from laughing STOP Wasnt it STOP said Bruno, very earnestly STOP Oo know it isnt every one
thats had such an honour as _that_ STOP This set me thinking of the various queer things we call an honour in
this world, but which, after all, havent a bit more honour in them than
what Bruno enjoyed, when he took the King a glass of cider STOP I dont know how long I might not have dreamed on in this way, if Bruno
hadnt suddenly roused me STOP Oh, come here quick STOP he cried, in a state
of the wildest excitement STOP Catch hold of his other horn STOP I cant hold
him more than a minute STOP He was struggling desperately with a great snail, clinging to one of its
horns, and nearly breaking his poor little back in his efforts to drag
it over a blade of grass STOP I saw we should have no more gardening if I let this sort of thing go
on, so I quietly took the snail away, and put it on a bank where he
couldnt reach it STOP Well hunt it afterwards, Bruno, I said, if you
really want to catch it STOP But whats the use of it when youve got it STOP Whats the use of a fox when oove got it STOP said Bruno STOP I know oo big
things hunt foxes STOP I tried to think of some good reason why big things should hunt foxes,
and he should not hunt snails, but none came into my head: so I said at
last, Well, I suppose ones as good as the other STOP Ill go snail-hunting
myself some day STOP I should think oo wouldnt be so silly, said Bruno, as to go
snail-hunting by oorself STOP Why, ood never get the snail along, if oo
hadnt somebody to hold on to his other horn STOP Of course I shant go _alone_, I said, quite gravely STOP By the way, is
that the best kind to hunt, or do you recommend the ones without
shells STOP Oh, no, we never hunt the ones without shells, Bruno said, with a
little shudder at the thought of it STOP Theyre always so cross about it;
and then, if oo tumbles over them, theyre ever so sticky STOP By this time we had nearly finished the garden STOP I had fetched some
violets, and Bruno was just helping me to put in the last, when he
suddenly stopped and said Im tired STOP Rest then, I said: I can go on without you, quite well STOP Bruno needed no second invitation: he at once began arranging the dead
mouse as a kind of sofa STOP And Ill sing oo a little song, he said, as
he rolled it about STOP Do, said I: I like songs very much STOP Which song will oo choose STOP Bruno said, as he dragged the mouse into a
place where he could get a good view of me STOP Ting, ting, ting is the
nicest STOP There was no resisting such a strong hint as this: however, I pretended
to think about it for a moment, and then said Well, I like Ting, ting,
ting, best of all STOP [Illustration: BRUNOS REVENGE]

That shows oore a good judge of music, Bruno said, with a pleased
look STOP How many hare-bells would oo like STOP And he put his thumb into his
mouth to help me to consider STOP As there was only one cluster of hare-bells within easy reach, I said
very gravely that I thought one would do _this_ time, and I picked it
and gave it to him STOP Bruno ran his hand once or twice up and down the
flowers, like a musician trying an instrument, producing a most
delicious delicate tinkling as he did so STOP I had never heard flower-music
beforeI dont think one can, unless ones in the eerie stateand I
dont know quite how to give you an idea of what it was like, except by
saying that it sounded like a peal of bells a thousand miles off STOP When
he had satisfied himself that the flowers were in tune, he seated
himself on the dead mouse (he never seemed really comfortable anywhere
else), and, looking up at me with a merry twinkle in his eyes, he began STOP By the way, the tune was rather a curious one, and you might like to try
it for yourself, so here are the notes STOP [Illustration: TING, TING, TING]

  Rise, oh, rise STOP The daylight dies:
    The owls are hooting, ting, ting, ting STOP Wake, oh, wake STOP Beside the lake
    The elves are fluting, ting, ting, ting STOP Welcoming our Fairy King,
    We sing, sing, sing STOP He sang the first four lines briskly and merrily, making the hare-bells
chime in time with the music; but the last two he sang quite slowly and
gently, and merely waved the flowers backwards and forwards STOP Then he
left off to explain STOP The Fairy-King is Oberon, and he lives across the
lakeand sometimes he comes in a little boatand we go and meet himand
then we sing this song, you know STOP And then you go and dine with him STOP I said, mischievously STOP Oo shouldnt talk, Bruno hastily said: it interrupts the song so STOP I said I wouldnt do it again STOP I never talk myself when Im singing, he went on very gravely: so
_oo_ shouldnt either STOP Then he tuned the hare-bells once more, and
sang:

  Hear, oh, hear STOP From far and near
    The music stealing, ting, ting, ting STOP Fairy bells adown the dells
    Are merrily pealing, ting, ting, ting STOP Welcoming our Fairy King,
    We ring, ring, ring STOP See, oh, see STOP On every tree
    What lamps are shining, ting, ting, ting STOP They are eyes of fiery flies
    To light our dining, ting, ting, ting STOP Welcoming our Fairy King
    They swing, swing, swing STOP Haste, oh haste, to take and taste
    The dainties waiting, ting, ting, ting STOP Honey-dew is stored

Hush, Bruno STOP I interrupted in a warning whisper STOP Shes coming STOP Bruno checked his song, and, as she slowly made her way through the long
grass, he suddenly rushed out headlong at her like a little bull,
shouting Look the other way STOP Look the other way STOP Which way STOP Sylvie asked, in rather a frightened tone, as she looked
round in all directions to see where the danger could be STOP _That_ way STOP said Bruno, carefully turning her round with her face to
the wood STOP Now, walk backwardswalk gentlydont be frightened: oo
shant trip STOP But Sylvie _did_ trip notwithstanding: in fact he led her, in his hurry,
across so many little sticks and stones, that it was really a wonder the
poor child could keep on her feet at all STOP But he was far too much
excited to think of what he was doing STOP I silently pointed out to Bruno the best place to lead her to, so as to
get a view of the whole garden at once: it was a little rising ground,
about the height of a potato; and, when they had mounted it, I drew back
into the shade, that Sylvie mightnt see me STOP I heard Bruno cry out triumphantly _Now_ oo may look STOP and then
followed a clapping of hands, but it was all done by Bruno himself STOP Sylvie was silentshe only stood and gazed with her hands clasped
together, and I was half afraid she didnt like it after all STOP Bruno too was watching her anxiously, and when she jumped down off the
mound, and began wandering up and down the little walks, he cautiously
followed her about, evidently anxious that she should form her own
opinion of it all, without any hint from him STOP And when at last she drew
a long breath, and gave her verdictin a hurried whisper, and without
the slightest regard to grammarIts the loveliest thing as I never saw
in all my life before STOP the little fellow looked as well pleased as if
it had been given by all the judges and juries in England put together STOP And did you really do it all by yourself, Bruno STOP said Sylvie STOP And all
for me STOP I was helped a bit, Bruno began, with a merry little laugh at her
surprise STOP Weve been at it all the afternoonI thought ood like and
here the poor little fellows lip began to quiver, and all in a moment
he burst out crying, and running up to Sylvie he flung his arms
passionately round her neck, and hid his face on her shoulder STOP There was a little quiver in Sylvies voice too, as she whispered Why,
whats the matter, darling STOP and tried to lift up his head and kiss him STOP But Bruno only clung to her, sobbing, and wouldnt be comforted till he
had confessed STOP I triedto spoil oor gardenfirstbut Ill nevernever
and then came another burst of tears, which drowned the rest of the
sentence STOP At last he got out the words I likedputting in the
flowersfor _oo_, Sylvieand I never was so happy before STOP And the rosy
little face came up at last to be kissed, all wet with tears as it was STOP Sylvie was crying too by this time, and she said nothing but Bruno,
dear STOP and _I_ never was so happy before, though why these two
children who had never been so happy before should both be crying was a
mystery to _me_ STOP _I_ felt very happy too, but of course I didnt cry: big things never
do, you knowwe leave all that to the Fairies STOP Only I think it must have
been raining a little just then, for I found a drop or two on my cheeks STOP After that they went through the whole garden again, flower by flower,
as if it were a long sentence they were spelling out, with kisses for
commas, and a great hug by way of a full-stop when they got to the end STOP Doos oo know, that was my river-edge, Sylvie STOP Bruno solemnly began STOP Sylvie laughed merrily STOP What _do_ you mean STOP she said STOP And she pushed
back her heavy brown hair with both hands, and looked at him with
dancing eyes in which the big tear-drops were still glittering STOP Bruno drew in a long breath, and made up his mouth for a great effort STOP I mean re-venge, he said: now oo undertand STOP And he looked so happy
and proud at having said the word right at last, that I quite envied
him STOP I rather think Sylvie didnt undertand at all; but she gave him
a little kiss on each cheek, which seemed to do just as well STOP So they wandered off lovingly together, in among the buttercups, each
with an arm twined round the other, whispering and laughing as they
went, and never so much as once looked back at poor me STOP Yes, once, just
before I quite lost sight of them, Bruno half turned his head, and
nodded me a saucy little good-bye over one shoulder STOP And that was all
the thanks I got for _my_ trouble STOP The very last thing I saw of them was
thisSylvie was stooping down with her arms round Brunos neck, and
saying coaxingly in his ear, Do you know, Bruno, Ive quite forgotten
that hard word STOP Do say it once more STOP Come STOP Only this once, dear STOP But Bruno wouldnt try it again STOP  STOP A CHANGED CROCODILE STOP The Marvellousthe Mysterioushad quite passed out of my life for the
moment: and the Common-place reigned supreme STOP I turned in the direction
of the Earls house, as it was now the witching hour of five, and I
knew I should find them ready for a cup of tea and a quiet chat STOP Lady Muriel and her father gave me a delightfully warm welcome STOP They
were not of the folk we meet in fashionable drawing-roomswho conceal
all such feelings as they may chance to possess beneath the impenetrable
mask of a conventional placidity STOP The Man with the Iron Mask was, no
doubt, a rarity and a marvel in his own age: in modern London no one
would turn his head to give him a second look STOP No, these were _real_
people STOP When they _looked_ pleased, it meant that they _were_ pleased:
and when Lady Muriel said, with a bright smile, Im _very_ glad to see
you again!, I knew that it was _true_ STOP Still I did not venture to disobey the injunctionscrazy as I felt them
to beof the love-sick young Doctor, by so much as alluding to his
existence: and it was only after they had given me full details of a
projected picnic, to which they invited me, that Lady Muriel exclaimed,
almost as an after-thought, and _do_, if you can, bring Doctor Forester
with you STOP Im sure a day in the country would do him good STOP Im afraid he
studies too much

It was on the tip of my tongue to quote the words His only books are
womans looks STOP but I checked myself just in timewith something of the
feeling of one who has crossed a street, and has been all but run over
by a passing Hansom STOP and I think he has too lonely a life, she went on, with a gentle
earnestness that left no room whatever to suspect a double meaning STOP _Do_ get him to come STOP And dont forget the day, Tuesday week STOP We can
drive you over STOP It would be a pity to go by railthere is so much pretty
scenery on the road STOP And our open carriage just holds four STOP Oh, _Ill_ persuade him to come STOP I said with confidencethinking it
would take all _my_ powers of persuasion to keep him away STOP The picnic was to take place in ten days: and though Arthur readily
accepted the invitation I brought him, nothing that I could say would
induce him to calleither with me or without meon the Earl and his
daughter in the meanwhile STOP No: he feared to wear out his welcome, he
said: they had seen enough of him for one while: and, when at last the
day for the expedition arrived, he was so childishly nervous and uneasy
that I thought it best so to arrange our plans that we should go
separately to the housemy intention being to arrive some time after
him, so as to give him time to get over a meeting STOP With this object I purposely made a considerable circuit on my way to
the Hall (as we called the Earls house): and if I could only manage to
lose my way a bit, I thought to myself, that would suit me capitally STOP In this I succeeded better, and sooner, than I had ventured to hope for STOP The path through the wood had been made familiar to me, by many a
solitary stroll, in my former visit to Elveston; and how I could have so
suddenly and so entirely lost iteven though I _was_ so engrossed in
thinking of Arthur and his lady-love that I heeded little elsewas a
mystery to me STOP And this open place, I said to myself, seems to have
some memory about it I cannot distinctly recallsurely it is the very
spot where I saw those Fairy-Children STOP But I hope there are no snakes
about STOP I mused aloud, taking my seat on a fallen tree STOP I certainly do
_not_ like snakesand I dont suppose _Bruno_ likes them, either STOP No, he _doesnt_ like them STOP said a demure little voice at my side STOP Hes not _afraid_ of them, you know STOP But he doesnt _like_ them STOP He
says theyre too waggly STOP Words fail me to describe the beauty of the little groupcouched on a
patch of moss, on the trunk of the fallen tree, that met my eager gaze:
Sylvie reclining with her elbow buried in the moss, and her rosy cheek
resting in the palm of her hand, and Bruno stretched at her feet with
his head in her lap STOP [Illustration: FAIRIES RESTING]

Too waggly STOP was all I could say in so sudden an emergency STOP Im not praticular, Bruno said, carelessly: but I _do_ like straight
animals best

But you like a dog when it wags its tail, Sylvie interrupted STOP You
_know_ you do, Bruno STOP But theres more of a dog, isnt there, Mister Sir STOP Bruno appealed to
me STOP _You_ wouldnt like to have a dog if it hadnt got nuffin but a
head and a tail STOP I admitted that a dog of that kind would be uninteresting STOP There _isnt_ such a dog as that, Sylvie thoughtfully remarked STOP But there _would_ be, cried Bruno, if the Professor shortened it up
for us STOP Shortened it up STOP I said STOP Thats something new STOP How does he do it STOP Hes got a curious machine Sylvie was beginning to explain STOP A _welly_ curious machine, Bruno broke in, not at all willing to have
the story thus taken out of his mouth, and if oo puts
insomefinoruvverat _one_ end, oo knowand he turns the handleand it
comes out at the uvver end, oh, ever so short STOP As short as short STOP Sylvie echoed STOP And one daywhen we was in Outland, oo knowbefore we came to
Fairylandme and Sylvie took him a big Crocodile STOP And he shortened it up
for us STOP And it _did_ look so funny STOP And it kept looking round, and
saying wherever _is_ the rest of me got to STOP And then its eyes looked
unhappy

Not _both_ its eyes, Sylvie interrupted STOP Course not STOP said the little fellow STOP Only the eye that _couldnt_ see
wherever the rest of it had got to STOP But the eye that _could_ see
wherever

How short _was_ the crocodile STOP I asked, as the story was getting a
little complicated STOP Half as short again as when we caught it_so_ long, said Bruno,
spreading out his arms to their full stretch STOP I tried to calculate what this would come to, but it was too hard for
me STOP Please make it out for me, dear Child who reads this STOP But you didnt leave the poor thing so short as that, did you STOP Well, no STOP Sylvie and me took it back again and we got it stretched
totohow much was it, Sylvie STOP Two times and a half, and a little bit more, said Sylvie STOP It wouldnt like that better than the other way, Im afraid STOP Oh, but it did though STOP Bruno put in eagerly STOP It _were_ proud of its
new tail STOP Oo never saw a Crocodile so proud STOP Why, it could go round and
walk on the top of its tail, and along its back, all the way to its
head STOP [Illustration: A CHANGED CROCODILE]

Not _quite_ all the way, said Sylvie STOP It couldnt, you know STOP Ah, but it _did_, once STOP Bruno cried triumphantly STOP Oo werent
lookingbut _I_ watched it STOP And it walked on tipplety-toe, so as it
wouldnt wake itself, cause it thought it were asleep STOP And it got both
its paws on its tail STOP And it walked and it walked all the way along its
back STOP And it walked and it walked on its forehead STOP And it walked a tiny
little way down its nose STOP There now STOP This was a good deal worse than the last puzzle STOP Please, dear Child,
help again STOP I dont believe no Crocodile never walked along its own forehead STOP Sylvie cried, too much excited by the controversy to limit the number of
her negatives STOP Oo dont know the _reason_ why it did it STOP Bruno scornfully retorted STOP It had a welly good reason STOP I _heerd_ it say Why _shouldnt_ I walk on
my own forehead STOP So a course it _did_, oo know STOP If _thats_ a good reason, Bruno, I said, why shouldnt _you_ get up
that tree STOP _Shall_, in a minute, said Bruno: soon as weve done talking STOP Only
two peoples _cant_ talk comfably togevver, when ones getting up a
tree, and the other isnt STOP It appeared to me that a conversation would scarcely be comfable while
trees were being climbed, even if _both_ the peoples were doing it:
but it was evidently dangerous to oppose any theory of Brunos; so I
thought it best to let the question drop, and to ask for an account of
the machine that made things _longer_ STOP This time Bruno was at a loss, and left it to Sylvie STOP Its like a
mangle, she said: if things are put in, they get squoze

Squeezeled STOP Bruno interrupted STOP Yes STOP Sylvie accepted the correction, but did not attempt to pronounce
the word, which was evidently new to her STOP They getlike thatand they
come out, oh, ever so long STOP Once, Bruno began again, Sylvie and me writed

Wrote STOP Sylvie whispered STOP Well, we _wroted_ a Nursery-Song, and the Professor mangled it longer
for us STOP It were _There was a little Man, And he had a little gun, And
the bullets_

I know the rest, I interrupted STOP But would you say it _long_I mean
the way that it came _out_ of the mangle STOP Well get the Professor to _sing_ it for you, said Sylvie STOP It would
spoil it to _say_ it STOP I would like to meet the Professor, I said STOP And I would like to take
you all with me, to see some friends of mine, that live near here STOP Would
you like to come STOP I dont think the _Professor_ would like to come, said Sylvie STOP Hes
_very_ shy STOP But _wed_ like it very much STOP Only wed better not come
_this_ size, you know STOP The difficulty had occurred to me already: and I had felt that perhaps
there _would_ be a slight awkwardness in introducing two such tiny
friends into Society STOP What size will you be STOP I enquired STOP Wed better come ascommon _children_, Sylvie thoughtfully replied STOP Thats the easiest size to manage STOP Could you come to-day STOP I said, thinking then we could have you at the
picnic STOP Sylvie considered a little STOP Not _to-day_, she replied STOP We havent got
the things ready STOP Well come onTuesday next, if you like STOP And now,
_really_, Bruno, you must come and do your lessons STOP I _wiss_ oo wouldnt say _really_ Bruno STOP the little fellow pleaded,
with pouting lips that made him look prettier than ever STOP It _always_
shows theres something horrid coming STOP And I wont kiss you, if youre
so unkind STOP Ah, but you _have_ kissed me STOP Sylvie exclaimed in merry triumph STOP Well then, Ill _un_kiss you STOP And he threw his arms round her neck for
this novel, but apparently not _very_ painful, operation STOP Its _very_ like _kissing_ STOP Sylvie remarked, as soon as her lips were
again free for speech STOP Oo dont know _nuffin_ about it STOP It were just the _conkery_ STOP Bruno
replied with much severity, as he marched away STOP Sylvie turned her laughing face to me STOP Shall we come on Tuesday STOP she
said STOP Very well, I said: let it be Tuesday next STOP But where _is_ the
Professor STOP Did he come with you to Fairyland STOP No, said Sylvie STOP But he promised hed come and see us, _some_ day STOP Hes getting his Lecture ready STOP So he has to stay at home STOP At home STOP I said dreamily, not feeling quite sure what she had said STOP Yes, Sir STOP His Lordship and Lady Muriel _are_ at home STOP Please to walk
this way STOP  STOP THE THREE BADGERS STOP Still more dreamily I found myself following this imperious voice into a
room where the Earl, his daughter, and Arthur, were seated STOP So youre
come _at last_ STOP said Lady Muriel, in a tone of playful reproach STOP I was delayed, I stammered STOP Though _what_ it was that had delayed me I
should have been puzzled to explain STOP Luckily no questions were asked STOP The carriage was ordered round, the hamper, containing our contribution
to the Picnic, was duly stowed away, and we set forth STOP There was no need for _me_ to maintain the conversation STOP Lady Muriel and
Arthur were evidently on those most delightful of terms, where one has
no need to check thought after thought, as it rises to the lips, with
the fear _this_ will not be appreciated_this_ will give offence_this_
will sound too seriousthis will sound flippant: like very old friends,
in fullest sympathy, their talk rippled on STOP Why shouldnt we desert the Picnic and go in some other direction STOP she
suddenly suggested STOP A party of four is surely self-sufficing STOP And as
for _food_, our hamper

Why _shouldnt_ we STOP What a genuine _ladys_ argument STOP laughed Arthur STOP A lady never knows on which side the _onus probandi_the burden of
provinglies STOP Do _men_ always know STOP she asked with a pretty assumption of meek
docility STOP With _one_ exceptionthe only one I can think ofDr STOP Watts, who has
asked the senseless question

  Why should I deprive my neighbour
  Of his goods against his will STOP Fancy _that_ as an argument for Honesty STOP His position seems to be Im
only honest because I see no reason to steal STOP And the _thiefs_ answer
is of course complete and crushing STOP I deprive my neighbour of his goods
because I want them myself STOP And I do it against his will because theres
no chance of getting him to consent to it STOP I can give you one other exception, I said: an argument I heard only
to-dayand _not_ by a lady STOP Why shouldnt I walk on my own forehead STOP What a curious subject for speculation STOP said Lady Muriel, turning to
me, with eyes brimming over with laughter STOP May we know who propounded
the question STOP And _did_ he walk on his own forehead STOP I cant remember _who_ it was that said it STOP I faltered STOP Nor _where_
I heard it STOP Whoever it was, I hope we shall meet him at the Picnic STOP said Lady
Muriel STOP Its a _far_ more interesting question than _Isnt_ this a
picturesque ruin STOP _Arent_ those autumn-tints lovely STOP I shall have to
answer those two questions _ten_ times, at least, this afternoon STOP Thats one of the miseries of Society STOP said Arthur STOP Why cant people
let one enjoy the beauties of Nature without having to _say_ so every
minute STOP Why should Life be one long Catechism STOP Its just as bad at a picture-gallery, the Earl remarked STOP I went to
the R.A. last May, with a conceited young artist: and he _did_ torment
me STOP I wouldnt have minded his criticizing the pictures _himself_: but
_I_ had to agree with himor else to argue the point, which would have
been worse STOP It was _depreciatory_ criticism, of course STOP said Arthur STOP I dont see the of course at all STOP Why, did you ever know a conceited man dare to _praise_ a picture STOP The
one thing he dreads (next to not being noticed) is _to be proved
fallible_ STOP If you once _praise_ a picture, your character for
_infallibility_ hangs by a thread STOP Suppose its a figure-picture, and
you venture to say draws well STOP Somebody measures it, and finds one of
the proportions an eighth of an inch wrong STOP _You_ are disposed of as a
critic STOP Did you say he draws _well_ STOP your friends enquire
sarcastically, while you hang your head and blush STOP No STOP The only _safe_
course, if any one says draws well, is to shrug your shoulders STOP _Draws_ well STOP you repeat thoughtfully STOP Draws _well_ STOP Humph STOP Thats
the way to become a great critic STOP Thus airily chatting, after a pleasant drive through a few miles of
beautiful scenery, we reached the _rendezvous_a ruined castlewhere the
rest of the picnic-party were already assembled STOP We spent an hour or two
in sauntering about the ruins: gathering at last, by common consent,
into a few random groups, seated on the side of a mound, which commanded
a good view of the old castle and its surroundings STOP The momentary silence, that ensued, was promptly taken possession ofor,
more correctly, taken into custodyby a Voice; a voice so smooth, so
monotonous, so sonorous, that one felt, with a shudder, that any other
conversation was precluded, and that, unless some desperate remedy were
adopted, we were fated to listen to a Lecture, of which no man could
foresee the end STOP The speaker was a broadly-built man, whose large, flat, pale face was
bounded on the North by a fringe of hair, on the East and West by a
fringe of whisker, and on the South by a fringe of beardthe whole
constituting a uniform halo of stubbly whitey-brown bristles STOP His
features were so entirely destitute of expression that I could not help
saying to myselfhelplessly, as if in the clutches of a night-marethey
are only penciled in: no final touches as yet STOP And he had a way of
ending every sentence with a sudden smile, which spread like a ripple
over that vast blank surface, and was gone in a moment, leaving behind
it such absolute solemnity that I felt impelled to murmur it was not
_he_: it was somebody else that smiled STOP Do you observe STOP (such was the phrase with which the wretch began each
sentence) Do you observe the way in which that broken arch, at the very
top of the ruin, stands out against the clear sky STOP It is placed
_exactly_ right: and there is _exactly_ enough of it STOP A little more, or
a little less, and all would be utterly spoiled STOP [Illustration: A LECTURE ON ART]

Oh gifted architect STOP murmured Arthur, inaudibly to all but Lady Muriel
and myself STOP Foreseeing the exact effect his work would have, when in
ruins, centuries after his death STOP And do you observe, where those trees slope down the hill, (indicating
them with a sweep of the hand, and with all the patronising air of the
man who has himself arranged the landscape), how the mists rising from
the river fill up _exactly_ those intervals where we _need_
indistinctness, for artistic effect STOP Here, in the foreground, a few
clear touches are not amiss: but a _back_-ground without mist, you know STOP It is simply barbarous STOP Yes, we _need_ indistinctness STOP The orator looked so pointedly at _me_ as he uttered these words, that I
felt bound to reply, by murmuring something to the effect that I hardly
felt the need _myself_and that I enjoyed looking at a thing, better,
when I could _see_ it STOP Quite so STOP the great man sharply took me up STOP From _your_ point of
view, that is correctly put STOP But for any one who has a soul for _Art_,
such a view is preposterous STOP _Nature_ is one thing STOP _Art_ is another STOP _Nature_ shows us the world as it _is_ STOP But _Art_as a Latin author
tells us_Art_, you knowthe words have escaped my memory

_Ars est celare Naturam_, Arthur interposed with a delightful
promptitude STOP Quite so STOP the orator replied with an air of relief STOP I thank you STOP _Ars
est celare Naturam_but that isnt it STOP And, for a few peaceful moments,
the orator brooded, frowningly, over the quotation STOP The welcome
opportunity was seized, and _another_ voice struck into the silence STOP What a _lovely_ old ruin it is STOP cried a young lady in spectacles, the
very embodiment of the March of Mind, looking at Lady Muriel, as the
proper recipient of all really _original_ remarks STOP And _dont_ you
admire those autumn-tints on the trees STOP _I_ do, _intensely_ STOP Lady Muriel shot a meaning glance at me; but replied with admirable
gravity STOP Oh yes indeed, indeed STOP _So_ true STOP And isnt it strange, said the young lady, passing with startling
suddenness from Sentiment to Science, that the mere impact of certain
coloured rays upon the Retina should give us such exquisite pleasure STOP You have studied Physiology, then STOP a certain young Doctor courteously
enquired STOP Oh, _yes_ STOP Isnt it a _sweet_ Science STOP Arthur slightly smiled STOP It seems a paradox, does it not, he went on,
that the image formed on the Retina should be inverted STOP It _is_ puzzling, she candidly admitted STOP Why is it we do not _see_
things upside-down STOP You have never heard the Theory, then, that the _Brain_ also is
inverted STOP No _indeed_ STOP What a _beautiful_ fact STOP But how is it _proved_ STOP _Thus_, replied Arthur, with all the gravity of ten Professors rolled
into one STOP What we call the _vertex_ of the Brain is really its _base_:
and what we call its _base_ is really its _vertex_: it is simply a
question of _nomenclature_ STOP This last polysyllable settled the matter STOP How truly delightful STOP the
fair Scientist exclaimed with enthusiasm STOP I shall ask our Physiological
Lecturer why he never gave us that _exquisite_ Theory STOP Id give something to be present when the question is asked STOP Arthur
whispered to me, as, at a signal from Lady Muriel, we moved on to where
the hampers had been collected, and devoted ourselves to the more
_substantial_ business of the day STOP We waited on ourselves, as the modern barbarism (combining two good
things in such a way as to secure the discomforts of both and the
advantages of neither) of having a picnic with servants to wait upon
you, had not yet reached this out-of-the-way regionand of course the
gentlemen did not even take their places until the ladies had been duly
provided with all imaginable creature-comforts STOP Then I supplied myself
with a plate of something solid and a glass of something fluid, and
found a place next to Lady Muriel STOP It had been left vacantapparently for Arthur, as a distinguished
stranger: but he had turned shy, and had placed himself next to the
young lady in spectacles, whose high rasping voice had already cast
loose upon Society such ominous phrases as Man is a bundle of
Qualities!, the Objective is only attainable through the Subjective! STOP Arthur was bearing it bravely: but several faces wore a look of alarm,
and I thought it high time to start some less metaphysical topic STOP In my nursery days, I began, when the weather didnt suit for an
out-of-doors picnic, we were allowed to have a peculiar kind, that we
enjoyed hugely STOP The table cloth was laid _under_ the table, instead of
upon it: we sat round it on the floor: and I believe we really enjoyed
that extremely uncomfortable kind of dinner more than we ever did the
orthodox arrangement STOP Ive no doubt of it, Lady Muriel replied STOP Theres nothing a
well-regulated child hates so much as regularity STOP I believe a really
healthy boy would thoroughly enjoy Greek Grammarif only he might stand
on his head to learn it STOP And your carpet-dinner certainly spared you
_one_ feature of a picnic, which is to me its chief drawback STOP The chance of a shower STOP I suggested STOP No, the chanceor rather the certaintyof _live_ things occurring in
combination with ones food STOP _Spiders_ are _my_ bugbear STOP Now my father
has _no_ sympathy with that sentiment_have_ you, dear STOP For the Earl
had caught the word and turned to listen STOP To each his sufferings, all are men, he replied in the sweet sad tones
that seemed natural to him: each has his pet aversion STOP But youll never guess _his_ STOP Lady Muriel said, with that delicate
silvery laugh that was music to my ears STOP I declined to attempt the impossible STOP He doesnt like _snakes_ STOP she said, in a stage whisper STOP Now, isnt
_that_ an unreasonable aversion STOP Fancy not liking such a dear,
coaxingly, _clingingly_ affectionate creature as a snake STOP Not like _snakes_ STOP I exclaimed STOP Is such a thing possible STOP No, he _doesnt_ like them, she repeated with a pretty mock-gravity STOP Hes not _afraid_ of them, you know STOP But he doesnt _like_ them STOP He
says theyre too waggly STOP I was more startled than I liked to show STOP There was something so
_uncanny_ in this echo of the very words I had so lately heard from that
little forest-sprite, that it was only by a great effort I succeeded in
saying, carelessly, Let us banish so unpleasant a topic STOP Wont you sing
us something, Lady Muriel STOP I know you _do_ sing without music STOP The only songs I knowwithout musicare _desperately_ sentimental, Im
afraid STOP Are your tears all ready STOP Quite ready STOP Quite ready STOP came from all sides, and Lady Murielnot
being one of those lady-singers who think it _de rigueur_ to decline to
sing till they have been petitioned three or four times, and have
pleaded failure of memory, loss of voice, and other conclusive reasons
for silencebegan at once:

[Illustration: THREE BADGERS ON A MOSSY STONE]

  There be three Badgers on a mossy stone,
    Beside a dark and covered way:
  Each dreams himself a monarch on his throne,
        And so they stay and stay
  Though their old Father languishes alone,
        They stay, and stay, and stay STOP There be three Herrings loitering around,
    Longing to share that mossy seat:
  Each Herring tries to sing what she has found
        That makes Life seem so sweet STOP Thus, with a grating and uncertain sound,
        They bleat, and bleat, and bleat STOP The Mother-Herring, on the salt sea-wave,
    Sought vainly for her absent ones:
  The Father-Badger, writhing in a cave,
        Shrieked out Return, my sons STOP You shall have buns, he shrieked, if youll behave STOP Yea, buns, and buns, and buns STOP I fear, said she, your sons have gone astray STOP My daughters left me while I slept STOP Yes m, the Badger said: its as you say STOP They should be better kept STOP Thus the poor parents talked the time away,
        And wept, and wept, and wept STOP Here Bruno broke off suddenly STOP The Herrings Song wants anuvver tune,
Sylvie, he said STOP And I cant sing itnot wizout oo plays it for me STOP [Illustration: THE FATHER-BADGER, WRITHING IN A CAVE]

Instantly Sylvie seated herself upon a tiny mushroom, that happened to
grow in front of a daisy, as if it were the most ordinary musical
instrument in the world, and played on the petals as if they were the
notes of an organ STOP And such delicious _tiny_ music it was STOP Such
teeny-tiny music STOP Bruno held his head on one side, and listened very gravely for a few
moments until he had caught the melody STOP Then the sweet childish voice
rang out once more:

  Oh, dear beyond our dearest dreams,
  Fairer than all that fairest seems STOP To feast the rosy hours away,
  To revel in a roundelay STOP How blest would be
        A life so free
  Ipwergis-Pudding to consume,
  And drink the subtle Azzigoom STOP And if, in other days and hours,
  Mid other fluffs and other flowers,
  The choice were given me how to dine
  Name what thou wilt: it shall be thine STOP Oh, then I see
        The life for me
  Ipwergis-Pudding to consume,
  And drink the subtle Azzigoom STOP Oo may leave off playing _now_, Sylvie STOP I can do the uvver tune much
better wizout a compliment STOP He means without _accompaniment_, Sylvie whispered, smiling at my
puzzled look: and she pretended to shut up the stops of the organ STOP The Badgers did not care to talk to Fish:
    They did not dote on Herrings songs:
  They never had experienced the dish
        To which that name belongs:
  And oh, to pinch their tails, (this was their wish,)
        With tongs, yea, tongs, and tongs STOP I ought to mention that he marked the parenthesis, in the air, with his
finger STOP It seemed to me a very good plan STOP You know theres no _sound_ to
represent itany more than there is for a question STOP Suppose you have said to your friend, You are better to-day, and that
you want him to understand that you are asking him a _question_, what
can be simpler than just to make a  STOP in the air with your finger STOP He
would understand you in a moment STOP And are not these the Fish, the Eldest sighed,
    Whose Mother dwells beneath the foam STOP They _are_ the Fish STOP the Second one replied STOP And they have left their home STOP Oh wicked Fish, the Youngest Badger cried,
      To roam, yea, roam, and roam STOP [Illustration: THOSE AGED ONES WAXED GAY]

  Gently the Badgers trotted to the shore
    The sandy shore that fringed the bay:
  Each in his mouth a living Herring bore
        Those aged ones waxed gay:
  Clear rang their voices through the oceans roar,
        Hooray, hooray, hooray STOP So they all got safe home again, Bruno said, after waiting a minute to
see if _I_ had anything to say: he evidently felt that _some_ remark
ought to be made STOP And I couldnt help wishing there were some such rule
in Society, at the conclusion of a songthat the singer _herself_ should
say the right thing, and not leave it to the audience STOP Suppose a young
lady has just been warbling (with a grating and uncertain sound)
Shelleys exquisite lyric _I arise from dreams of thee_: how much
nicer it would be, instead of _your_ having to say Oh, _thank_ you,
_thank_ you STOP for the young lady herself to remark, as she draws on her
gloves, while the impassioned words _Oh, press it to thine own, or it
will break at last!_ are still ringing in your ears, but she wouldnt
do it, you know STOP So it _did_ break at last STOP And I _knew_ it would STOP she added quietly, as I started at the sudden
crash of broken glass STOP Youve been holding it sideways for the last
minute, and letting all the champagne run out STOP Were you asleep, I
wonder STOP Im _so_ sorry my singing has such a narcotic effect STOP  STOP QUEER STREET, NUMBER FORTY STOP Lady Muriel was the speaker STOP And, for the moment, that was the only fact
I could clearly realise STOP But how she came to be thereand how _I_ came
to be thereand how the glass of champagne came to be thereall these
were questions which I felt it better to think out in silence, and not
commit myself to any statement till I understood things a little more
clearly STOP First accumulate a mass of Facts: and _then_ construct a Theory STOP _That_, I believe, is the true Scientific Method STOP I sat up, rubbed my
eyes, and began to accumulate Facts STOP A smooth grassy slope, bounded, at the upper end, by venerable ruins
half buried in ivy, at the lower, by a stream seen through arching
treesa dozen gaily-dressed people, seated in little groups, here and
theresome open hampersthe _debris_ of a picnicsuch were the _Facts_
accumulated by the Scientific Researcher STOP And now, what deep,
far-reaching _Theory_ was he to construct from them STOP The Researcher
found himself at fault STOP Yet stay STOP One Fact had escaped his notice STOP While
all the rest were grouped in twos and in threes, _Arthur_ was alone:
while all tongues were talking, _his_ was silent: while all faces were
gay, _his_ was gloomy and despondent STOP Here was a _Fact_ indeed STOP The
Researcher felt that a _Theory_ must be constructed without delay STOP Lady Muriel had just risen and left the party STOP Could _that_ be the cause
of his despondency STOP The Theory hardly rose to the dignity of a Working
Hypothesis STOP Clearly more Facts were needed STOP The Researcher looked round him once more: and now the Facts accumulated
in such bewildering profusion, that the Theory was lost among them STOP For
Lady Muriel had gone to meet a strange gentleman, just visible in the
distance: and now she was returning with him, both of them talking
eagerly and joyfully, like old friends who have been long parted: and
now she was moving from group to group, introducing the new hero of the
hour: and he, young, tall, and handsome, moved gracefully at her side,
with the erect bearing and firm tread of a soldier STOP Verily, the Theory
looked gloomy for Arthur STOP His eye caught mine, and he crossed to me STOP He is very handsome, I said STOP Abominably handsome STOP muttered Arthur: then smiled at his own bitter
words STOP Lucky no one heard me but you STOP Doctor Forester, said Lady Muriel, who had just joined us, let me
introduce to you my cousin Eric Lindon_Captain_ Lindon, I should say STOP Arthur shook off his ill-temper instantly and completely, as he rose and
gave the young soldier his hand STOP I have heard of you, he said STOP Im
very glad to make the acquaintance of Lady Muriels cousin STOP Yes, thats all Im distinguished for, _as yet_ STOP said Eric (so we soon
got to call him) with a winning smile STOP And I doubt, glancing at Lady
Muriel, if it even amounts to a good-conduct-badge STOP But its something
to begin with STOP You must come to my father, Eric, said Lady Muriel STOP I think hes
wandering among the ruins STOP And the pair moved on STOP The gloomy look returned to Arthurs face: and I could see it was only
to distract his thoughts that he took his place at the side of the
metaphysical young lady, and resumed their interrupted discussion STOP Talking of Herbert Spencer, he began, do you really find no _logical_
difficulty in regarding Nature as a process of involution, passing from
definite coherent homogeneity to indefinite incoherent heterogeneity STOP Amused as I was at the ingenious jumble he had made of Spencers words,
I kept as grave a face as I could STOP No _physical_ difficulty, she confidently replied: but I havent
studied _Logic_ much STOP Would you _state_ the difficulty STOP Well, said Arthur, do you accept it as self-evident STOP Is it as
obvious, for instance, as that things that are greater than the same
are greater than one another STOP To _my_ mind, she modestly replied, it seems _quite_ as obvious STOP I
grasp _both_ truths by intuition STOP But _other_ minds may need some
logicalI forget the technical terms STOP For a _complete_ logical argument, Arthur began with admirable
solemnity, we need two prim Misses

Of course STOP she interrupted STOP I remember that word now STOP And they
produce STOP A Delusion, said Arthur STOP Yees STOP she said dubiously STOP I dont seem to remember that so well STOP But
what is the _whole_ argument called STOP A Sillygism STOP Ah, yes STOP I remember now STOP But I dont need a Sillygism, you know, to
prove that mathematical axiom you mentioned STOP Nor to prove that all angles are equal, I suppose STOP Why, of course not STOP One takes such a simple truth as that for granted STOP Here I ventured to interpose, and to offer her a plate of strawberries
and cream STOP I felt really uneasy at the thought that she _might_ detect
the trick: and I contrived, unperceived by her, to shake my head
reprovingly at the pseudo-philosopher STOP Equally unperceived by her,
Arthur slightly raised his shoulders, and spread his hands abroad, as
who should say What else can I say to her STOP and moved away, leaving her
to discuss her strawberries by involution, or any other way she
preferred STOP By this time the carriages, that were to convey the revelers to their
respective homes, had begun to assemble outside the Castle-grounds: and
it became evidentnow that Lady Muriels cousin had joined our
partythat the problem, how to convey five people to Elveston, with a
carriage that would only hold four, must somehow be solved STOP The Honorable Eric Lindon, who was at this moment walking up and down
with Lady Muriel, might have solved it at once, no doubt, by announcing
his intention of returning on foot STOP Of _this_ solution there did not
seem to be the very smallest probability STOP The next best solution, it seemed to me, was that _I_ should walk home:
and this I at once proposed STOP Youre sure you dont mind STOP said the Earl STOP Im afraid the carriage
wont take us all, and I dont like to suggest to Eric to desert his
cousin so soon STOP So far from minding it, I said, I should prefer it STOP It will give me
time to sketch this beautiful old ruin STOP Ill keep you company, Arthur suddenly said STOP And, in answer to what I
suppose was a look of surprise on my face, he said in a low voice, I
_really_ would rather STOP I shall be quite _de trop_ in the carriage STOP I think Ill walk too, said the Earl STOP Youll have to be content with
_Eric_ as your escort, he added, to Lady Muriel, who had joined us
while he was speaking STOP You must be as entertaining as Cerberusthree gentlemen rolled into
one Lady Muriel said to her companion STOP It will be a grand military
exploit STOP A sort of Forlorn Hope STOP the Captain modestly suggested STOP You _do_ pay pretty compliments STOP laughed his fair cousin STOP Good day to
you, gentlemen threeor rather deserters three STOP And the two young folk
entered the carriage and were driven away STOP How long will your sketch take STOP said Arthur STOP Well, I said, I should like an hour for it STOP Dont you think you had
better go without me STOP Ill return by train STOP I know theres one in about
an hours time STOP Perhaps that _would_ be best, said the Earl STOP The Station is quite
close STOP So I was left to my own devices, and soon found a comfortable seat, at
the foot of a tree, from which I had a good view of the ruins STOP It is a very drowsy day, I said to myself, idly turning over the
leaves of the sketch-book to find a blank page STOP Why, I thought you were
a mile off by this time STOP For, to my surprise, the two walkers were back
again STOP I came back to remind you, Arthur said, that the trains go every ten
minutes

Nonsense STOP I said STOP It isnt the Metropolitan Railway STOP It _is_ the Metropolitan Railway, the Earl insisted STOP This is a part
of Kensington STOP Why do you talk with your eyes shut STOP said Arthur STOP Wake up STOP I think its the heat makes me so drowsy, I said, hoping, but not
feeling quite sure, that I was talking sense STOP Am I awake now STOP I think _not_, the Earl judicially pronounced STOP What do _you_ think,
Doctor STOP Hes only got one eye open STOP And hes snoring like anything STOP cried Bruno STOP Do wake up, you dear old
thing STOP And he and Sylvie set to work, rolling the heavy head from side
to side, as if its connection with the shoulders was a matter of no sort
of importance STOP And at last the Professor opened his eyes, and sat up, blinking at us
with eyes of utter bewilderment STOP Would you have the kindness to
mention, he said, addressing me with his usual old-fashioned courtesy,
whereabouts we are just nowand _who_ we are, beginning with me STOP I thought it best to begin with the children STOP This is Sylvie, Sir; and
_this_ is Bruno STOP Ah, yes STOP I know _them_ well enough STOP the old man murmured STOP Its
_myself_ Im most anxious about STOP And perhaps youll be good enough to
mention, at the same time, how I got here STOP A harder problem occurs to _me_, I ventured to say: and that is, how
youre to get back again STOP True, true STOP the Professor replied STOP Thats _the_ Problem, no doubt STOP Viewed _as_ a Problem, outside of oneself, it is a _most_ interesting
one STOP Viewed as a portion of ones own biography, it is, I must admit,
very distressing STOP He groaned, but instantly added, with a chuckle, As
to _myself_, I think you mentioned that I am

Oore the _Professor_ STOP Bruno shouted in his ear STOP Didnt oo know
_that_ STOP Oove come from _Outland_ STOP And its _ever_ so far away from
here STOP The Professor leapt to his feet with the agility of a boy STOP Then theres
no time to lose STOP he exclaimed anxiously STOP Ill just ask this guileless
peasant, with his brace of buckets that contain (apparently) water, if
hell be so kind as to direct us STOP Guileless peasant STOP he proceeded in a
louder voice STOP Would you tell us the way to Outland STOP The guileless peasant turned with a sheepish grin STOP Hey STOP was all he
said STOP ThewaytoOutland STOP the Professor repeated STOP The guileless peasant set down his buckets and considered STOP Ah dunnot

I ought to mention, the Professor hastily put in, that whatever you
say will be used in evidence against you STOP The guileless peasant instantly resumed his buckets STOP Then ah says
nowt STOP he answered briskly, and walked away at a great pace STOP The children gazed sadly at the rapidly vanishing figure STOP He goes very
quick STOP the Professor said with a sigh STOP But I _know_ that was the right
thing to say STOP Ive studied your English Laws STOP However, lets ask this
next man thats coming STOP He is _not_ guileless, and he is _not_ a
peasantbut I dont know that either point is of vital importance STOP It was, in fact, the Honourable Eric Lindon, who had apparently
fulfilled his task of escorting Lady Muriel home, and was now strolling
leisurely up and down the road outside the house, enjoying a solitary
cigar STOP Might I trouble you, Sir, to tell us the nearest way to Outland STOP Oddity as he was, in outward appearance, the Professor was, in that
essential nature which no outward disguise could conceal, a thorough
gentleman STOP And, as such, Eric Lindon accepted him instantly STOP He took the cigar from
his mouth, and delicately shook off the ash, while he considered STOP The
name sounds strange to me, he said STOP I doubt if I can help you STOP It is not _very_ far from _Fairyland_, the Professor suggested STOP Eric Lindons eye-brows were slightly raised at these words, and an
amused smile, which he courteously tried to repress, flitted across his
handsome face STOP A trifle _cracked_ STOP he muttered to himself STOP But what a
jolly old patriarch it is STOP Then he turned to the children STOP And cant
_you_ help him, little folk STOP he said, with a gentleness of tone that
seemed to win their hearts at once STOP Surely _you_ know all about it STOP How many miles to Babylon STOP Three-score miles and ten STOP Can I get there by candlelight STOP Yes, and back again STOP To my surprise, Bruno ran forwards to him, as if he were some old friend
of theirs, seized the disengaged hand and hung on to it with both of his
own: and there stood this tall dignified officer in the middle of the
road, gravely swinging a little boy to and fro, while Sylvie stood ready
to push him, exactly as if a real swing had suddenly been provided for
their pastime STOP We dont want to get to _Babylon_, oo know STOP Bruno explained as he
swung STOP And it isnt _candlelight_: its _daylight_ STOP Sylvie added, giving the
swing a push of extra vigour, which nearly took the whole machine off
its balance STOP By this time it was clear to me that Eric Lindon was quite unconscious
of my presence STOP Even the Professor and the children seemed to have lost
sight of me: and I stood in the midst of the group, as unconcernedly as
a ghost, seeing but unseen STOP How perfectly isochronous STOP the Professor exclaimed with enthusiasm STOP He
had his watch in his hand, and was carefully counting Brunos
oscillations STOP He measures time quite as accurately as a pendulum STOP [Illustration: HOW PERFECTLY ISOCHRONOUS! STOP Yet even pendulums, the good-natured young soldier observed, as he
carefully released his hand from Brunos grasp, are not a joy _for
ever_ STOP Come, thats enough for one bout, little man STOP Next time we meet,
you shall have another STOP Meanwhile youd better take this old gentleman
to Queer Street, Number

_Well_ find it STOP cried Bruno eagerly, as they dragged the Professor
away STOP We are much indebted to you STOP the Professor said, looking over his
shoulder STOP Dont mention it STOP replied the officer, raising his hat as a parting
salute STOP _What_ number did you say STOP the Professor called from the distance STOP The officer made a trumpet of his two hands STOP Forty STOP he shouted in
stentorian tones STOP And not _piano_, by any means STOP he added to himself STOP Its a mad world, my masters, a mad world STOP He lit another cigar, and
strolled on towards his hotel STOP What a lovely evening STOP I said, joining him as he passed me STOP Lovely indeed, he said STOP Where did _you_ come from STOP Dropped from the
clouds STOP Im strolling your way, I said; and no further explanation seemed
necessary STOP Have a cigar STOP Thanks: Im not a smoker STOP Is there a Lunatic Asylum near here STOP Not that I know of STOP Thought there might be STOP Met a lunatic just now STOP Queer old fish as ever
I saw STOP And so, in friendly chat, we took our homeward ways, and wished each
other good-night at the door of his hotel STOP Left to myself, I felt the eerie feeling rush over me again, and saw,
standing at the door of Number Forty, the three figures I knew so well STOP Then its the wrong house STOP Bruno was saying STOP No, no STOP Its the right _house_, the Professor cheerfully replied: but
its the wrong _street_ STOP _Thats_ where weve made our mistake STOP Our best
plan, now, will be to

It was over STOP The street was empty STOP Commonplace life was around me, and
the eerie feeling had fled STOP  STOP HOW TO MAKE A PHLIZZ STOP The week passed without any further communication with the Hall, as
Arthur was evidently fearful that we might wear out our welcome; but
when, on Sunday morning, we were setting out for church, I gladly agreed
to his proposal to go round and enquire after the Earl, who was said to
be unwell STOP Eric, who was strolling in the garden, gave us a good report of the
invalid, who was still in bed, with Lady Muriel in attendance STOP Are you coming with us to church STOP I enquired STOP Thanks, no, he courteously replied STOP Its notexactlyin my line, you
know STOP Its an excellent institutionfor the _poor_ STOP When Im with my own
folk, I go, just to set them an example STOP But Im not known _here_: so I
think Ill excuse myself sitting out a sermon STOP Country-preachers are
always so dull STOP Arthur was silent till we were out of hearing STOP Then he said to himself,
almost inaudibly, _Where two or three are gathered together in my name,
there am I in the midst of them._

Yes, I assented: no doubt that _is_ the principle on which
church-going rests STOP And when he _does_ go, he continued (our thoughts ran so much
together, that our conversation was often slightly elliptical), I
suppose he repeats the words _I believe in the Communion of Saints_ STOP But by this time we had reached the little church, into which a goodly
stream of worshipers, consisting mainly of fishermen and their families,
was flowing STOP The service would have been pronounced by any modern sthetic
religionistor religious sthete, which is it?to be crude and cold: to
me, coming fresh from the ever-advancing developments of a London church
under a _soi-disant_ Catholic Rector, it was unspeakably refreshing STOP There was no theatrical procession of demure little choristers, trying
their best not to simper under the admiring gaze of the congregation:
the peoples share in the service was taken by the people themselves,
unaided, except that a few good voices, judiciously posted here and
there among them, kept the singing from going too far astray STOP There was no murdering of the noble music, contained in the Bible and
the Liturgy, by its recital in a dead monotone, with no more expression
than a mechanical talking-doll STOP No, the prayers were _prayed_, the lessons were _read_, andbest of
allthe sermon was _talked_; and I found myself repeating, as we left
the church, the words of Jacob, when he _awaked out of his sleep_ STOP _Surely the Lord is in this place STOP This is none other but the house of
God, and this is the gate of heaven._

Yes, said Arthur, apparently in answer to my thoughts, those high
services are fast becoming pure Formalism STOP More and more the people are
beginning to regard them as performances, in which they only assist
in the French sense STOP And it is _specially_ bad for the little boys STOP Theyd be much less self-conscious as pantomime-fairies STOP With all that
dressing-up, and stage-entrances and exits, and being always _en
evidence_, no wonder if theyre eaten up with vanity, the blatant little
coxcombs STOP When we passed the Hall on our return, we found the Earl and Lady Muriel
sitting out in the garden STOP Eric had gone for a stroll STOP We joined them, and the conversation soon turned on the sermon we had
just heard, the subject of which was selfishness STOP What a change has come over our pulpits, Arthur remarked, since the
time when Paley gave that utterly selfish definition of virtue, _the
doing good to mankind, in obedience to the will of God, and for the sake
of everlasting happiness_ STOP Lady Muriel looked at him enquiringly, but she seemed to have learned by
intuition, what years of experience had taught _me_, that the way to
elicit Arthurs deepest thoughts was neither to assent nor dissent, but
simply to _listen_ STOP At that time, he went on, a great tidal wave of selfishness was
sweeping over human thought STOP Right and Wrong had somehow been
transformed into Gain and Loss, and Religion had become a sort of
commercial transaction STOP We may be thankful that our preachers are
beginning to take a nobler view of life STOP But is it not taught again and again in the _Bible_ STOP I ventured to
ask STOP Not in the Bible as a _whole_, said Arthur STOP In the Old Testament, no
doubt, rewards and punishments are constantly appealed to as motives for
action STOP That teaching is best for _children_, and the Israelites seem to
have been, mentally, _utter_ children STOP We guide our children thus, at
first: but we appeal, as soon as possible, to their innate sense of
Right and Wrong: and, when _that_ stage is safely past, we appeal to the
highest motive of all, the desire for likeness to, and union with, the
Supreme Good STOP I think you will find that to be the teaching of the
Bible, _as a whole_, beginning with _that thy days may be long in the
land_, and ending with _be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in
heaven is perfect_ STOP We were silent for awhile, and then Arthur went off on another tack STOP Look at the literature of Hymns, now STOP How cankered it is, through and
through, with selfishness STOP There are few human compositions more utterly
degraded than some modern Hymns STOP I quoted the stanza

  Whatever, Lord, we lend to Thee,
  Repaid a thousandfold shall be,
  Then gladly will we give to Thee,
                      Giver of all STOP Yes, he said grimly: that is the typical stanza STOP And the very last
charity-sermon I heard was infected with it STOP After giving many good
reasons for charity, the preacher wound up with and, for all you give,
you will be repaid a thousandfold STOP Oh the utter meanness of such a
motive, to be put before men who _do_ know what self-sacrifice is, who
_can_ appreciate generosity and heroism STOP Talk of Original _Sin_ STOP he
went on with increasing bitterness STOP Can you have a stronger proof of
the Original Goodness there must be in this nation, than the fact that
Religion has been preached to us, as a commercial speculation, for a
century, and that we still believe in a God STOP It couldnt have gone on so long, Lady Muriel musingly remarked, if
the Opposition hadnt been practically silencedput under what the
French call _la cloture_ STOP Surely in any lecture-hall, or in private
society, such teaching would soon have been hooted down STOP I trust so, said Arthur: and, though I dont want to see brawling in
church legalised, I must say that our preachers enjoy an _enormous_
privilegewhich they ill deserve, and which they misuse terribly STOP We put
our man into a pulpit, and we virtually tell him Now, you may stand
there and talk to us for half-an-hour STOP We wont interrupt you by so much
as a _word_ STOP You shall have it all your own way STOP And what does he give
us in return STOP Shallow twaddle, that, if it were addressed to you over a
dinner-table, you would think Does the man take me for a _fool_ STOP The return of Eric from his walk checked the tide of Arthurs eloquence,
and, after a few minutes talk on more conventional topics, we took our
leave STOP Lady Muriel walked with us to the gate STOP You have given me much
to think about, she said earnestly, as she gave Arthur her hand STOP Im
so glad you came in STOP And her words brought a real glow of pleasure into
that pale worn face of his STOP On the Tuesday, as Arthur did not seem equal to more walking, I took a
long stroll by myself, having stipulated that he was not to give the
_whole_ day to his books, but was to meet me at the Hall at about
tea-time STOP On my way back, I passed the Station just as the
afternoon-train came in sight, and sauntered down the stairs to see it
come in STOP But there was little to gratify my idle curiosity: and, when
the train was empty, and the platform clear, I found it was about time
to be moving on, if I meant to reach the Hall by five STOP As I approached the end of the platform, from which a steep irregular
wooden staircase conducted to the upper world, I noticed two passengers,
who had evidently arrived by the train, but who, oddly enough, had
entirely escaped my notice, though the arrivals had been so few STOP They
were a young woman and a little girl: the former, so far as one could
judge by appearances, was a nursemaid, or possibly a nursery-governess,
in attendance on the child, whose refined face, even more than her
dress, distinguished her as of a higher class than her companion STOP The childs face was refined, but it was also a worn and sad one, and
told a tale (or so I seemed to read it) of much illness and suffering,
sweetly and patiently borne STOP She had a little crutch to help herself
along with: and she was now standing, looking wistfully up the long
staircase, and apparently waiting till she could muster courage to begin
the toilsome ascent STOP There are some things one _says_ in lifeas well as things one
_does_which come automatically, by _reflex action_, as the
physiologists say (meaning, no doubt, action _without_ reflection, just
as _lucus_ is said to be derived _a non lucendo_) STOP Closing ones
eyelids, when something seems to be flying into the eye, is one of those
actions, and saying May I carry the little girl up the stairs STOP was
another STOP It wasnt that any thought of offering help occurred to me, and
that _then_ I spoke: the first intimation I had, of being likely to make
that offer, was the sound of my own voice, and the discovery that the
offer had been made STOP The servant paused, doubtfully glancing from her
charge to me, and then back again to the child STOP Would you like it,
dear STOP she asked her STOP But no such doubt appeared to cross the childs
mind: she lifted her arms eagerly to be taken up STOP Please STOP was all she
said, while a faint smile flickered on the weary little face STOP I took her
up with scrupulous care, and her little arm was at once clasped
trustfully round my neck STOP [Illustration: THE LAME CHILD]

She was a _very_ light weightso light, in fact, that the ridiculous
idea crossed my mind that it was rather easier going up, with her in my
arms, than it would have been without her: and, when we reached the road
above, with its cart-ruts and loose stonesall formidable obstacles for
a lame childI found that I had said Id better carry her over this
rough place, before I had formed any _mental_ connection between its
roughness and my gentle little burden STOP Indeed its troubling you too
much, Sir STOP the maid exclaimed STOP She can walk very well on the flat STOP But the arm, that was twined about my neck, clung just an atom more
closely at the suggestion, and decided me to say Shes no weight,
really STOP Ill carry her a little further STOP Im going your way STOP The nurse raised no further objection: and the next speaker was a ragged
little boy, with bare feet, and a broom over his shoulder, who ran
across the road, and pretended to sweep the perfectly dry road in front
of us STOP Give us a apny STOP the little urchin pleaded, with a broad grin
on his dirty face STOP _Dont_ give him a apny STOP said the little lady in my arms STOP The
_words_ sounded harsh: but the _tone_ was gentleness itself STOP Hes an
_idle_ little boy STOP And she laughed a laugh of such silvery sweetness as
I had never yet heard from any lips but Sylvies STOP To my astonishment,
the boy actually _joined_ in the laugh, as if there were some subtle
sympathy between them, as he ran away down the road and vanished through
a gap in the hedge STOP But he was back in a few moments, having discarded his broom and
provided himself, from some mysterious source, with an exquisite bouquet
of flowers STOP Buy a posy, buy a posy STOP Only a apny STOP he chanted, with
the melancholy drawl of a professional beggar STOP _Dont_ buy it STOP was Her Majestys edict, as she looked down, with a
lofty scorn that seemed curiously mixed with tender interest, on the
ragged creature at her feet STOP But this time I turned rebel, and ignored the royal commands STOP Such
lovely flowers, and of forms so entirely new to me, were not to be
abandoned at the bidding of any little maid, however imperious STOP I bought
the bouquet: and the little boy, after popping the halfpenny into his
mouth, turned head-over-heels, as if to ascertain whether the human
mouth is really adapted to serve as a money-box STOP With wonder, that increased every moment, I turned over the flowers, and
examined them one by one: there was not a single one among them that I
could remember having ever seen before STOP At last I turned to the
nursemaid STOP Do these flowers grow wild about here STOP I never saw but
the speech died away on my lips STOP The nursemaid had vanished STOP You can put me down, _now_, if you like, Sylvie quietly remarked STOP I obeyed in silence, and could only ask myself Is this a _dream_?, on
finding Sylvie and Bruno walking one on either side of me, and clinging
to my hands with the ready confidence of childhood STOP Youre larger than when I saw you last STOP I began STOP Really I think we
ought to be introduced again STOP Theres so much of you that I never met
before, you know STOP Very well STOP Sylvie merrily replied STOP This is _Bruno_ STOP It doesnt take
long STOP Hes only got one name STOP Theres _another_ name to me STOP Bruno protested, with a reproachful look
at the Mistress of the Ceremonies STOP And its_Esquire_ STOP Oh, of course STOP I forgot, said Sylvie STOP Bruno_Esquire_ STOP And did you come here to meet _me_, my children STOP I enquired STOP You know I _said_ wed come on Tuesday, Sylvie explained STOP Are we the
proper size for common children STOP Quite the right size for _children_, I replied, (adding mentally
though not _common_ children, by any means! STOP But what became of the
nursemaid STOP It are _gone_ STOP Bruno solemnly replied STOP Then it wasnt solid, like Sylvie and you STOP No STOP Oo couldnt _touch_ it, oo know STOP If oo walked _at_ it, ood go
right froo STOP I quite expected youd find it out, once, said Sylvie STOP Bruno ran it
against a telegraph post, by accident STOP And it went in two halves STOP But
you were looking the other way STOP I felt that I had indeed missed an opportunity: to witness such an event
as a nursemaid going in two halves does not occur twice in a
life-time STOP When did oo guess it were Sylvie STOP Bruno enquired STOP [Illustration: IT WENT IN TWO HALVES]

I didnt guess it, till it _was_ Sylvie, I said STOP But how did you
manage the nursemaid STOP _Bruno_ managed it, said Sylvie STOP Its called a Phlizz STOP And how do you make a Phlizz, Bruno STOP The Professor teached me how, said Bruno STOP First oo takes a lot of
air

Oh, _Bruno_ STOP Sylvie interposed STOP The Professor said you werent to
tell STOP But who did her _voice_ STOP I asked STOP Indeed its troubling you too much, Sir STOP She can walk very well on the
flat STOP Bruno laughed merrily as I turned hastily from side to side, looking in
all directions for the speaker STOP That were _me_ STOP he gleefully
proclaimed, in his own voice STOP She can indeed walk very well on the flat, I said STOP And I think _I_
was the Flat STOP By this time we were near the Hall STOP This is where my friends live, I
said STOP Will you come in and have some tea with them STOP Bruno gave a little jump of joy: and Sylvie said Yes, please STOP Youd
like some tea, Bruno, wouldnt you STOP He hasnt tasted _tea_, she
explained to me, since we left Outland STOP And _that_ werent _good_ tea STOP said Bruno STOP It were so _welly_ weak STOP  STOP LIGHT COME, LIGHT GO STOP Lady Muriels smile of welcome could not _quite_ conceal the look of
surprise with which she regarded my new companions STOP I presented them in due form STOP This is _Sylvie_, Lady Muriel STOP And this
is _Bruno_ STOP Any surname STOP she enquired, her eyes twinkling with fun STOP No, I said gravely STOP No surname STOP She laughed, evidently thinking I said it in fun; and stooped to kiss
the childrena salute to which _Bruno_ submitted with reluctance:
_Sylvie_ returned it with interest STOP While she and Arthur (who had arrived before me) supplied the children
with tea and cake, I tried to engage the Earl in conversation: but he
was restless and _distrait_, and we made little progress STOP At last, by a
sudden question, he betrayed the cause of his disquiet STOP _Would_ you let me look at those flowers you have in your hand STOP Willingly STOP I said, handing him the bouquet STOP Botany was, I knew, a
favourite study of his: and these flowers were to me so entirely new and
mysterious, that I was really curious to see what a botanist would say
of them STOP They did _not_ diminish his disquiet STOP On the contrary, he became every
moment more excited as he turned them over STOP _These_ are all from
Central India STOP he said, laying aside part of the bouquet STOP They are
rare, even there: and I have never seen them in any other part of the
world STOP _These_ two are Mexican_This_ one (He rose hastily, and
carried it to the window, to examine it in a better light, the flush of
excitement mounting to his very forehead) is, I am nearly surebut I
have a book of Indian Botany here He took a volume from the
book-shelves, and turned the leaves with trembling fingers STOP Yes STOP Compare it with this picture STOP It is the exact duplicate STOP This is the
flower of the Upas-tree, which usually grows only in the depths of
forests; and the flower fades so quickly after being plucked, that it is
scarcely possible to keep its form or colour even so far as the
outskirts of the forest STOP Yet this is in full bloom STOP _Where_ did you get
these flowers STOP he added with breathless eagerness STOP I glanced at Sylvie, who, gravely and silently, laid her finger on her
lips, then beckoned to Bruno to follow her, and ran out into the garden;
and I found myself in the position of a defendant whose two most
important witnesses have been suddenly taken away STOP Let me give you the
flowers STOP I stammered out at last, quite at my wits end as to how to
get out of the difficulty STOP You know much more about them than I do STOP I accept them most gratefully STOP But you have not yet told me the Earl
was beginning, when we were interrupted, to my great relief, by the
arrival of Eric Lindon STOP To _Arthur_, however, the new-comer was, I saw clearly, anything but
welcome STOP His face clouded over: he drew a little back from the circle,
and took no further part in the conversation, which was wholly
maintained, for some minutes, by Lady Muriel and her lively cousin, who
were discussing some new music that had just arrived from London STOP Do just try this one STOP he pleaded STOP The music looks easy to sing at
sight, and the songs quite appropriate to the occasion STOP Then I suppose its

  Five oclock tea STOP Ever to thee
  Faithful Ill be,
  Five oclock tea STOP laughed Lady Muriel, as she sat down to the piano, and lightly struck a
few random chords STOP Not quite: and yet it _is_ a kind of ever to thee faithful Ill be STOP Its a pair of hapless lovers: _he_ crosses the briny deep: and _she_ is
left lamenting STOP That is _indeed_ appropriate STOP she replied mockingly, as he placed the
song before her STOP And am _I_ to do the lamenting STOP And who for, if you please STOP She played the air once or twice through, first in quick, and finally in
slow, time; and then gave us the whole song with as much graceful ease
as if she had been familiar with it all her life:

  He stept so lightly to the land,
    All in his manly pride:
  He kissed her cheek, he pressed her hand,
    Yet still she glanced aside STOP Too gay he seems, she darkly dreams,
    Too gallant and too gay
  To think of mepoor simple me
    When he is far away STOP I bring my Love this goodly pearl
    Across the seas, he said:
  A gem to deck the dearest girl
    That ever sailor wed STOP She clasps it tight: her eyes are bright:
    Her throbbing heart would say
  He thought of mehe thought of me
    When he was far away STOP The ship has sailed into the West:
    Her ocean-bird is flown:
  A dull dead pain is in her breast,
    And she is weak and lone;
  Yet theres a smile upon her face,
    A smile that seems to say
  Hell think of mehell think of me
    When he is far away STOP Though waters wide between us glide,
    Our lives are warm and near:
  No distance parts two faithful hearts
    Two hearts that love so dear:
  And I will trust my sailor-lad,
    For ever and a day,
  To think of meto think of me
    When he is far away STOP The look of displeasure, which had begun to come over Arthurs face when
the young Captain spoke of Love so lightly, faded away as the song
proceeded, and he listened with evident delight STOP But his face darkened
again when Eric demurely remarked Dont you think my _soldier_-lad
would have fitted the tune just as well STOP Why, so it would STOP Lady Muriel gaily retorted STOP Soldiers, sailors,
tinkers, tailors, what a lot of words would fit in STOP I think my
_tinker_-lad sounds best STOP Dont _you_ STOP To spare my friend further pain, I rose to go, just as the Earl was
beginning to repeat his particularly embarrassing question about the
flowers STOP You have not yet

Yes, Ive _had_ some tea, thank you STOP I hastily interrupted him STOP And
now we really _must_ be going STOP Good evening, Lady Muriel STOP And we made
our adieux, and escaped, while the Earl was still absorbed in examining
the mysterious bouquet STOP Lady Muriel accompanied us to the door STOP You _couldnt_ have given my
father a more acceptable present STOP she said, warmly STOP He is so
passionately fond of Botany STOP Im afraid _I_ know nothing of the _theory_
of it, but I keep his _Hortus Siccus_ in order STOP I must get some sheets
of blotting-paper, and dry these new treasures for him before they
fade STOP _That_ wont be no good at all STOP said Bruno, who was waiting for us in
the garden STOP Why wont it STOP said I STOP You know I _had_ to give the flowers, to stop
questions STOP Yes, it cant be helped, said Sylvie: but they _will_ be sorry when
they find them gone STOP But how will they go STOP Well, I dont know _how_ STOP But they _will_ go STOP The nosegay was only a
_Phlizz_, you know STOP Bruno made it up STOP These last words were in a whisper, as she evidently did not wish Arthur
to hear STOP But of this there seemed to be little risk: he hardly seemed to
notice the children, but paced on, silent and abstracted; and when, at
the entrance to the wood, they bid us a hasty farewell and ran off, he
seemed to wake out of a day-dream STOP The bouquet vanished, as Sylvie had predicted; and when, a day or two
afterwards, Arthur and I once more visited the Hall, we found the Earl
and his daughter, with the old housekeeper, out in the garden, examining
the fastenings of the drawing-room window STOP We are holding an Inquest, Lady Muriel said, advancing to meet us:
and we admit you, as Accessories before the Fact, to tell us all you
know about those flowers STOP The Accessories before the Fact decline to answer _any_ questions, I
gravely replied STOP And they reserve their defence STOP Well then, turn Queens Evidence, please STOP The flowers have disappeared
in the night, she went on, turning to Arthur, and we are _quite_ sure
no one in the house has meddled with them STOP Somebody must have entered by
the window

But the fastenings have not been tampered with, said the Earl STOP It must have been while you were dining, my Lady, said the
housekeeper STOP That was it, said the Earl STOP The thief must have seen you bring the
flowers, turning to me, and have noticed that you did _not_ take them
away STOP And he must have known their great valuethey are simply
_priceless_ STOP he exclaimed, in sudden excitement STOP And you never told us how you got them STOP said Lady Muriel STOP Some day, I stammered, I may be free to tell you STOP Just now, would you
excuse me STOP The Earl looked disappointed, but kindly said Very well, we will ask no
questions STOP [Illustration: FIVE OCLOCK TEA]

But we consider you a _very_ bad Queens Evidence, Lady Muriel added
playfully, as we entered the arbour STOP We pronounce you to be an
accomplice: and we sentence you to solitary confinement, and to be fed
on bread andbutter STOP Do you take sugar STOP It is disquieting, certainly, she resumed, when all
creature-comforts had been duly supplied, to find that the house has
been entered by a thiefin this out-of-the-way place STOP If only the
flowers had been _eatables_, one might have suspected a thief of quite
another shape

You mean that universal explanation for all mysterious disappearances,
the _cat_ did it STOP said Arthur STOP Yes, she replied STOP What a convenient thing it would be if all thieves
had the same shape STOP Its so confusing to have some of them quadrupeds
and others bipeds STOP It has occurred to me, said Arthur, as a curious problem in
Teleologythe Science of Final Causes, he added, in answer to an
enquiring look from Lady Muriel STOP And a Final Cause is STOP Well, suppose we saythe last of a series of connected eventseach of
the series being the cause of the nextfor whose sake the first event
takes place STOP But the last event is practically an _effect_ of the first, isnt it STOP And yet you call it a _cause_ of it STOP Arthur pondered a moment STOP The words are rather confusing, I grant you,
he said STOP Will this do STOP The last event is an effect of the first: but
the _necessity_ for that event is a cause of the _necessity_ for the
first STOP That seems clear enough, said Lady Muriel STOP Now let us have the
problem STOP Its merely this STOP What object can we imagine in the arrangement by
which each different size (roughly speaking) of living creatures has its
special shape STOP For instance, the human race has one kind of
shapebipeds STOP Another set, ranging from the lion to the mouse, are
quadrupeds STOP Go down a step or two further, and you come to insects with
six legshexapodsa beautiful name, is it not STOP But beauty, in our sense
of the word, seems to diminish as we go down: the creature becomes
moreI wont say ugly of any of Gods creaturesmore uncouth STOP And,
when we take the microscope, and go a few steps lower still, we come
upon animalcul, terribly uncouth, and with a terrible number of legs STOP The other alternative, said the Earl, would be a _diminuendo_ series
of repetitions of the same type STOP Never mind the monotony of it: lets
see how it would work in other ways STOP Begin with the race of men, and the
creatures they require: let us say horses, cattle, sheep, and dogswe
dont exactly require frogs and spiders, do we, Muriel STOP Lady Muriel shuddered perceptibly: it was evidently a painful subject STOP We can dispense with _them_, she said gravely STOP Well, then well have a second race of men, half-a-yard high

who would have _one_ source of exquisite enjoyment, not possessed by
ordinary men STOP Arthur interrupted STOP _What_ source STOP said the Earl STOP Why, the grandeur of scenery STOP Surely the grandeur of a mountain, to
_me_, depends on its _size_, relative to me STOP Double the height of the
mountain, and of course its twice as grand STOP Halve _my_ height, and you
produce the same effect STOP Happy, happy, happy Small STOP Lady Muriel murmured rapturously STOP None but
the Short, none but the Short, none but the Short enjoy the Tall STOP But let me go on, said the Earl STOP Well have a third race of men, five
inches high; a fourth race, an inch high

They couldnt eat common beef and mutton, Im sure STOP Lady Muriel
interrupted STOP True, my child, I was forgetting STOP Each set must have its own cattle and
sheep STOP And its own vegetation, I added STOP What could a cow, an inch high, do
with grass that waved far above its head STOP That is true STOP We must have a pasture within a pasture, so to speak STOP The
common grass would serve our inch-high cows as a green forest of palms,
while round the root of each tall stem would stretch a tiny carpet of
microscopic grass STOP Yes, I think our scheme will work fairly well STOP And it
would be very interesting, coming into contact with the races below us STOP What sweet little things the inch-high bull-dogs would be STOP I doubt if
even _Muriel_ would run away from one of them STOP Dont you think we ought to have a _crescendo_ series, as well STOP said
Lady Muriel STOP Only fancy being a hundred yards high STOP One could use an
elephant as a paper-weight, and a crocodile as a pair of scissors STOP And would you have races of different sizes communicate with one
another STOP I enquired STOP Would they make war on one another, for instance,
or enter into treaties STOP _War_ we must exclude, I think STOP When you could crush a whole nation
with one blow of your fist, you couldnt conduct war on equal terms STOP But
anything, involving a collision of _minds_ only, would be possible in
our ideal worldfor of course we must allow _mental_ powers to all,
irrespective of size STOP Perhaps the fairest rule would be that, the
_smaller_ the race, the _greater_ should be its intellectual
development STOP Do you mean to say, said Lady Muriel, that these manikins of an inch
high are to _argue_ with me STOP Surely, surely STOP said the Earl STOP An argument doesnt depend for its
logical force on the _size_ of the creature that utters it STOP She tossed her head indignantly STOP I would _not_ argue with any man less
than six inches high STOP she cried STOP Id make him _work_ STOP What at STOP said Arthur, listening to all this nonsense with an amused
smile STOP _Embroidery!_ she readily replied STOP What _lovely_ embroidery they
would do STOP Yet, if they did it wrong, I said, you couldnt _argue_ the question STOP I dont know _why_: but I agree that it couldnt be done STOP The reason is, said Lady Muriel, one couldnt sacrifice ones
_dignity_ so far STOP Of course one couldnt STOP echoed Arthur STOP Any more than one could argue
with a potato STOP It would be altogetherexcuse the ancient pun_infra
dig._ STOP I doubt it, said I STOP Even a pun doesnt _quite_ convince me STOP Well, if that is _not_ the reason, said Lady Muriel, what reason
would you give STOP I tried hard to understand the meaning of this question: but the
persistent humming of the bees confused me, and there was a drowsiness
in the air that made every thought stop and go to sleep before it had
got well thought out: so all I could say was That must depend on the
_weight_ of the potato STOP I felt the remark was not so sensible as I should have liked it to be STOP But Lady Muriel seemed to take it quite as a matter of course STOP In that
case she began, but suddenly started, and turned away to listen STOP Dont you hear him STOP she said STOP Hes crying STOP We must go to him,
somehow STOP And I said to myself Thats very strange STOP I quite thought it was _Lady
Muriel_ talking to me STOP Why, its _Sylvie_ all the while STOP And I made
another great effort to say something that should have some meaning in
it STOP Is it about the potato STOP  STOP THROUGH THE IVORY DOOR STOP I dont know, said Sylvie STOP Hush STOP I must think STOP I could go to him, by
myself, well enough STOP But I want _you_ to come too STOP Let me go with you, I pleaded STOP I can walk as fast as _you_ can, Im
sure STOP Sylvie laughed merrily STOP What nonsense STOP she cried STOP Why, you cant
walk a bit STOP Youre lying quite flat on your back STOP You dont understand
these things STOP I can walk as well as _you_ can, I repeated STOP And I tried my best to
walk a few steps: but the ground slipped away backwards, quite as fast
as I could walk, so that I made no progress at all STOP Sylvie laughed
again STOP There, I told you so STOP Youve no idea how funny you look, moving your
feet about in the air, as if you were walking STOP Wait a bit STOP Ill ask the
Professor what wed better do STOP And she knocked at his study-door STOP The door opened, and the Professor looked out STOP Whats that crying I
heard just now STOP he asked STOP Is it a human animal STOP Its a boy, Sylvie said STOP Im afraid youve been teasing him STOP No, _indeed_ I havent STOP Sylvie said, very earnestly STOP I _never_ tease
him STOP Well, I must ask the Other Professor about it STOP He went back into the
study, and we heard him whispering small human animalsays she hasnt
been teasing himthe kind thats called Boy

Ask her _which_ Boy, said a new voice STOP The Professor came out again STOP _Which_ Boy is it that you havent been teasing STOP Sylvie looked at me with twinkling eyes STOP You dear old thing STOP she
exclaimed, standing on tiptoe to kiss him, while he gravely stooped to
receive the salute STOP How you _do_ puzzle me STOP Why, there are _several_
boys I havent been teasing STOP The Professor returned to his friend: and this time the voice said Tell
her to bring them here_all_ of them STOP I cant, and I wont STOP Sylvie exclaimed, the moment he reappeared STOP Its _Bruno_ thats crying: and hes my brother: and, please, we _both_
want to go: he cant walk, you know: heshes _dreaming_, you know
(this in a whisper, for fear of hurting my feelings) STOP _Do_ lets go
through the Ivory Door STOP Ill ask him, said the Professor, disappearing again STOP He returned
directly STOP He says you may STOP Follow me, and walk on tip-toe STOP The difficulty with me would have been, just then, _not_ to walk on
tip-toe STOP It seemed very hard to reach down far enough to just touch the
floor, as Sylvie led me through the study STOP The Professor went before us to unlock the Ivory Door STOP I had just time
to glance at the Other Professor, who was sitting reading, with his back
to us, before the Professor showed us out through the door, and locked
it behind us STOP Bruno was standing with his hands over his face, crying
bitterly STOP [Illustration: WHATS THE MATTER, DARLING? STOP Whats the matter, darling STOP said Sylvie, with her arms round his neck STOP Hurted mine self _welly_ much STOP sobbed the poor little fellow STOP Im _so_ sorry, darling STOP How ever _did_ you manage to hurt yourself
so STOP Course I managed it STOP said Bruno, laughing through his tears STOP Doos oo
think nobody else but _oo_ cant manage things STOP Matters were looking distinctly brighter, now Bruno had begun to argue STOP Come, lets hear all about it STOP I said STOP My foot took it into its head to slip Bruno began STOP A foot hasnt got a head STOP Sylvie put in, but all in vain STOP I slipted down the bank STOP And I tripted over a stone STOP And the stone
hurted my foot STOP And I trod on a Bee STOP And the Bee stinged my finger STOP Poor Bruno sobbed again STOP The complete list of woes was too much for his
feelings STOP And it knewed I didnt _mean_ to trod on it STOP he added, as
the climax STOP That Bee should be ashamed of itself STOP I said severely, and Sylvie
hugged and kissed the wounded hero till all tears were dried STOP My fingers quite unstung now STOP said Bruno STOP Why doos there be stones STOP Mister Sir, doos oo know STOP Theyre good for _something_, I said: even if we dont know _what_ STOP Whats the good of _dandelions_, now STOP Dindledums STOP said Bruno STOP Oh, theyre ever so pretty STOP And stones arent
pretty, one bit STOP Would oo like some dindledums, Mister Sir STOP Bruno STOP Sylvie murmured reproachfully STOP You mustnt say Mister and
Sir, both at once STOP Remember what I told you STOP You telled me I were to say Mister when I spoked _about_ him, and I
were to say Sir when I spoked _to_ him STOP Well, youre not doing _both_, you know STOP Ah, but I _is_ doing bofe, Miss Praticular STOP Bruno exclaimed
triumphantly STOP I wishted to speak _about_ the Gemplunand I wishted to
speak _to_ the Gemplun STOP So a course I said Mister Sir STOP Thats all right, Bruno, I said STOP _Course_ its all right STOP said Bruno STOP Sylvie just knows nuffin at
all STOP There never _was_ an impertinenter boy STOP said Sylvie, frowning till her
bright eyes were nearly invisible STOP And there never was an ignoranter girl STOP retorted Bruno STOP Come along
and pick some dindledums STOP _Thats all shes fit for!_ he added in a
very loud whisper to me STOP But why do you say Dindledums, Bruno STOP _Dandelions_ is the right
word STOP Its because he jumps about so, Sylvie said, laughing STOP Yes, thats it, Bruno assented STOP Sylvie tells me the words, and then,
when I jump about, they get shooken up in my headtill theyre all
froth STOP I expressed myself as perfectly satisfied with this explanation STOP But
arent you going to pick me any dindledums, after all STOP Course we will STOP cried Bruno STOP Come along, Sylvie STOP And the happy
children raced away, bounding over the turf with the fleetness and grace
of young antelopes STOP Then you didnt find your way back to Outland STOP I said to the
Professor STOP Oh yes, I did STOP he replied, We never got to Queer Street; but I found
another way STOP Ive been backwards and forwards several times since then STOP I had to be present at the Election, you know, as the author of the new
Money-Act STOP The Emperor was so kind as to wish that _I_ should have the
credit of it STOP Let come what come may, (I remember the very words of
the Imperial Speech) if it _should_ turn out that the Warden _is_
alive, _you_ will bear witness that the change in the coinage is the
_Professors_ doing, not _mine_ STOP I never was so glorified in my life,
before STOP Tears trickled down his cheeks at the recollection, which
apparently was not _wholly_ a pleasant one STOP Is the Warden supposed to be _dead_ STOP Well, its _supposed_ so: but, mind you, _I_ dont believe it STOP The
evidence is _very_ weakmere hear-say STOP A wandering Jester, with a
Dancing-Bear (they found their way into the Palace, one day) has been
telling people he comes from Fairyland, and that the Warden died there STOP _I_ wanted the Vice-Warden to question him, but, most unluckily, he and
my Lady were always out walking when the Jester came round STOP Yes, the
Wardens supposed to be dead STOP And more tears trickled down the old
mans cheeks STOP But what is the new Money-Act STOP The Professor brightened up again STOP The Emperor started the thing, he
said STOP He wanted to make everybody in Outland twice as rich as he was
beforejust to make the new Government popular STOP Only there wasnt nearly
enough money in the Treasury to do it STOP So _I_ suggested that he might do
it by doubling the value of every coin and bank-note in Outland STOP Its
the simplest thing possible STOP I wonder nobody ever thought of it before STOP And you never saw such universal joy STOP The shops are full from morning to
night STOP Everybodys buying everything STOP And how was the glorifying done STOP A sudden gloom overcast the Professors jolly face STOP They did it as I
went home after the Election, he mournfully replied STOP It was kindly
meantbut I didnt like it STOP They waved flags all round me till I was
nearly blind: and they rang bells till I was nearly deaf: and they
strewed the road so thick with flowers that I lost my way STOP And the poor
old man sighed deeply STOP How far is it to Outland STOP I asked, to change the subject STOP About five days march STOP But one _must_ go backoccasionally STOP You see,
as Court-Professor, I have to be _always_ in attendance on Prince Uggug STOP The Empress would be _very_ angry if I left him, even for an hour STOP But surely, every time you come here, you are absent ten days, at
least STOP Oh, more than that STOP the Professor exclaimed STOP A fortnight, sometimes STOP But of course I keep a memorandum of the exact time when I started, so
that I can put the Court-time back to the very moment STOP Excuse me, I said STOP I dont understand STOP Silently the Professor drew from his pocket a square gold watch, with
six or eight hands, and held it out for my inspection STOP This, he began,
is an Outlandish Watch

So I should have thought STOP which has the peculiar property that, instead of _its_ going with the
_time_, the _time_ goes with _it_ STOP I trust you understand me now STOP Hardly, I said STOP Permit me to explain STOP So long as it is let alone, it takes its own
course STOP Time has _no_ effect upon it STOP I have known such watches, I remarked STOP It _goes_, of course, at the usual rate STOP Only the time has to go _with_
it STOP Hence, if I move the hands, I change the time STOP To move them
_forwards_, in _advance_ of the true time, is impossible: but I can move
them as much as a month _backwards_that is the limit STOP And then you have
the events all over againwith any alterations experience may suggest STOP _What_ a blessing such a watch would be, I thought, in real life STOP To
be able to unsay some heedless wordto undo some reckless deed STOP Might I
see the thing done STOP With pleasure STOP said the good natured Professor STOP When I move _this_
hand back to _here_, pointing out the place, History goes back fifteen
minutes STOP Trembling with excitement, I watched him push the hand round as he
described STOP Hurted mine self _welly_ much STOP Shrilly and suddenly the words rang in my ears, and, more startled than
I cared to show, I turned to look for the speaker STOP Yes STOP There was Bruno, standing with the tears running down his cheeks,
just as I had seen him a quarter of an hour ago; and there was Sylvie
with her arms round his neck STOP I had not the heart to make the dear little fellow go through his
troubles a second time, so hastily begged the Professor to push the
hands round into their former position STOP In a moment Sylvie and Bruno
were gone again, and I could just see them in the far distance, picking
dindledums STOP Wonderful, indeed STOP I exclaimed STOP It has another property, yet more wonderful, said the Professor STOP You
see this little peg STOP That is called the Reversal Peg STOP If you push it
in, the events of the next hour happen in the reverse order STOP Do not try
it now STOP I will lend you the Watch for a few days, and you can amuse
yourself with experiments STOP Thank you very much STOP I said as he gave me the Watch STOP Ill take the
greatest care of itwhy, here are the children again STOP We could only but find _six_ dindledums, said Bruno, putting them into
my hands, cause Sylvie said it were time to go back STOP And heres a big
blackberry for _ooself_ STOP We couldnt only find but _two_ STOP Thank you: its _very_ nice, I said STOP And I suppose _you_ ate the
other, Bruno STOP No, I didnt, Bruno said, carelessly STOP _Arent_ they pretty
dindledums, Mister Sir STOP Yes, very: but what makes you limp so, my child STOP Mine foots come _hurted_ again STOP Bruno mournfully replied STOP And he sat
down on the ground, and began nursing it STOP The Professor held his head between his handsan attitude that I knew
indicated distraction of mind STOP Better rest a minute, he said STOP It may
be better thenor it may be worse STOP If only I had some of my medicines
here STOP Im Court-Physician, you know, he added, aside to me STOP Shall I go and get you some blackberries, darling STOP Sylvie whispered,
with her arms round his neck; and she kissed away a tear that was
trickling down his cheek STOP Bruno brightened up in a moment STOP That _are_ a good plan STOP he exclaimed STOP I thinks my foot would come _quite_ unhurted, if I eated a
blackberrytwo or three blackberriessix or seven blackberries

Sylvie got up hastily STOP Id better go, she said, aside to me, before
he gets into the double figures STOP Let me come and help you, I said STOP I can reach higher up than you
can STOP Yes, please, said Sylvie, putting her hand into mine: and we walked
off together STOP Bruno _loves_ blackberries, she said, as we paced slowly along by a
tall hedge, that looked a promising place for them, and it was so
_sweet_ of him to make me eat the only one STOP Oh, it was _you_ that ate it, then STOP Bruno didnt seem to like to tell
me about it STOP No; I saw that, said Sylvie STOP Hes always afraid of being praised STOP But
he _made_ me eat it, really STOP I would much rather heoh, whats that STOP And she clung to my hand, half-frightened, as we came in sight of a
hare, lying on its side with legs stretched out, just in the entrance to
the wood STOP Its a _hare_, my child STOP Perhaps its asleep STOP No, it isnt asleep, Sylvie said, timidly going nearer to look at it:
its eyes are open STOP Is itis it her voice dropped to an awestruck
whisper, is it _dead_, do you think STOP Yes, its quite dead, I said, after stooping to examine it STOP Poor
thing STOP I think its been hunted to death STOP I know the harriers were out
yesterday STOP But they havent touched it STOP Perhaps they caught sight of
another, and left it to die of fright and exhaustion STOP Hunted to _death_ STOP Sylvie repeated to herself, very slowly and sadly STOP I thought hunting was a thing they _played_ atlike a game STOP Bruno and I
hunt snails: but we never hurt them when we catch them STOP Sweet angel STOP I thought STOP How am I to get the idea of _Sport_ into your
innocent mind STOP And as we stood, hand-in-hand, looking down at the dead
hare, I tried to put the thing into such words as she could understand STOP You know what fierce wild-beasts lions and tigers are STOP Sylvie nodded STOP Well, in some countries men _have_ to kill them, to save their own
lives, you know STOP Yes, said Sylvie: if one tried to kill _me_, Bruno would kill _it_if
he could STOP Well, and so the menthe huntersget to enjoy it, you know: the
running, and the fighting, and the shouting, and the danger STOP Yes, said Sylvie STOP Bruno likes danger STOP Well, but, in _this_ country, there arent any lions and tigers, loose:
so they hunt other creatures, you see STOP I hoped, but in vain, that this
would satisfy her, and that she would ask no more questions STOP They hunt _foxes_, Sylvie said, thoughtfully STOP And I think they _kill_
them, too STOP Foxes are very fierce STOP I daresay men dont love them STOP Are
hares fierce STOP No, I said STOP A hare is a sweet, gentle, timid animalalmost as gentle
as a lamb STOP But, if men _love_ hares, whywhy her voice quivered, and her sweet
eyes were brimming over with tears STOP Im afraid they _dont_ love them, dear child STOP All _children_ love them, Sylvie said STOP All ladies love them STOP Im afraid even _ladies_ go to hunt them, sometimes STOP Sylvie shuddered STOP Oh, no, not _ladies_ STOP she earnestly pleaded STOP Not
Lady Muriel STOP No, _she_ never does, Im surebut this is too sad a sight for _you_,
dear STOP Lets try and find some

But Sylvie was not satisfied yet STOP In a hushed, solemn tone, with bowed
head and clasped hands, she put her final question STOP Does God love
hares STOP Yes STOP I said STOP Im _sure_ He does STOP He loves every living thing STOP Even
sinful _men_ STOP How much more the animals, that cannot sin STOP I dont know what sin means, said Sylvie STOP And I didnt try to
explain it STOP Come, my child, I said, trying to lead her away STOP Wish good-bye to the
poor hare, and come and look for blackberries STOP Good-bye, poor hare STOP Sylvie obediently repeated, looking over her
shoulder at it as we turned away STOP And then, all in a moment, her
self-command gave way STOP Pulling her hand out of mine, she ran back to
where the dead hare was lying, and flung herself down at its side in
such an agony of grief as I could hardly have believed possible in so
young a child STOP Oh, my darling, my darling STOP she moaned, over and over again STOP And God
meant your life to be so beautiful STOP Sometimes, but always keeping her face hidden on the ground, she would
reach out one little hand, to stroke the poor dead thing, and then once
more bury her face in her hands, and sob as if her heart would break STOP [Illustration: THE DEAD HARE]

I was afraid she would really make herself ill: still I thought it best
to let her weep away the first sharp agony of grief: and, after a few
minutes, the sobbing gradually ceased, and Sylvie rose to her feet, and
looked calmly at me, though tears were still streaming down her cheeks STOP I did not dare to speak again, just yet; but simply held out my hand to
her, that we might quit the melancholy spot STOP Yes, Ill come now, she said STOP Very reverently she kneeled down, and
kissed the dead hare; then rose and gave me her hand, and we moved on in
silence STOP A childs sorrow is violent, but short; and it was almost in her usual
voice that she said, after a minute, Oh stop, stop STOP Here are some
_lovely_ blackberries STOP We filled our hands with fruit, and returned in all haste to where the
Professor and Bruno were seated on a bank, awaiting our return STOP Just before we came within hearing-distance, Sylvie checked me STOP Please
dont tell _Bruno_ about the hare STOP she said STOP Very well, my child STOP But why not STOP Tears again glittered in those sweet eyes, and she turned her head away,
so that I could scarcely hear her reply STOP Heshes very _fond_ of
gentle creatures, you know STOP And hedhed be so sorry STOP I dont want him
to be made sorry STOP And _your_ agony of sorrow is to count for nothing, then, sweet
unselfish child STOP I thought to myself STOP But no more was said till we had
reached our friends; and Bruno was far too much engrossed, in the feast
we had brought him, to take any notice of Sylvies unusually grave
manner STOP Im afraid its getting rather late, Professor STOP I said STOP Yes, indeed, said the Professor STOP I must take you all through the
Ivory Door again STOP Youve stayed your full time STOP Mightnt we stay a _little_ longer STOP pleaded Sylvie STOP Just _one_ minute STOP added Bruno STOP But the Professor was unyielding STOP Its a great privilege, coming
through at all, he said STOP We must go now STOP And we followed him
obediently to the Ivory Door, which he threw open, and signed to me to
go through first STOP Youre coming too, arent you STOP I said to Sylvie STOP Yes, she said: but you wont see us after youve gone through STOP But suppose I wait for you outside STOP I asked, as I stepped through the
doorway STOP In that case, said Sylvie, I think the potato would be _quite_
justified in asking _your_ weight STOP I can quite imagine a really
_superior_ kidney-potato declining to argue with any one under _fifteen
stone_ STOP With a great effort I recovered the thread of my thoughts STOP We lapse
very quickly into nonsense STOP I said STOP  STOP CROSSING THE LINE STOP Let us lapse back again, said Lady Muriel STOP Take another cup of tea STOP I
hope _thats_ sound common sense STOP And all that strange adventure, I thought, has occupied the space of
a single comma in Lady Muriels speech STOP A single comma, for which
grammarians tell us to count _one_ STOP (I felt no doubt that the
Professor had kindly put back the time for me, to the exact point at
which I had gone to sleep. STOP When, a few minutes afterwards, we left the house, Arthurs first remark
was certainly a strange one STOP Weve been there just _twenty minutes_,
he said, and Ive done nothing but listen to you and Lady Muriel
talking: and yet, somehow, I feel exactly as if _I_ had been talking
with her for an _hour_ at least STOP And so he _had_ been, I felt no doubt: only, as the time had been put
back to the beginning of the tete-a-tete he referred to, the whole of it
had passed into oblivion, if not into nothingness STOP But I valued my own
reputation for sanity too highly to venture on explaining to _him_ what
had happened STOP For some cause, which I could not at the moment divine, Arthur was
unusually grave and silent during our walk home STOP It could not be
connected with Eric Lindon, I thought, as he had for some days been away
in London: so that, having Lady Muriel almost all to himselffor _I_
was only too glad to hear those two conversing, to have any wish to
intrude any remarks of my ownhe _ought_, theoretically, to have been
specially radiant and contented with life STOP Can he have heard any bad
news STOP I said to myself STOP And, almost as if he had read my thoughts, he
spoke STOP He will be here by the last train, he said, in the tone of one who is
continuing a conversation rather than beginning one STOP Captain Lindon, do you mean STOP YesCaptain Lindon, said Arthur: I said he, because I fancied we
were talking about him STOP The Earl told me he comes to-night, though
_to-morrow_ is the day when he will know about the Commission that hes
hoping for STOP I wonder he doesnt stay another day to hear the result, if
hes really so anxious about it as the Earl believes he is STOP He can have a telegram sent after him, I said: but its not very
soldier-like, running away from possible bad news STOP Hes a very good fellow, said Arthur: but I confess it would be good
news for _me_, if he got his Commission, and his Marching Orders, all at
once STOP I wish him all happinesswith _one_ exception STOP Good night STOP (We
had reached home by this time. STOP Im not good company to-nightbetter be
alone STOP It was much the same, next day STOP Arthur declared he wasnt fit for
Society, and I had to set forth alone for an afternoon-stroll STOP I took
the road to the Station, and, at the point where the road from the
Hall joined it, I paused, seeing my friends in the distance, seemingly
bound for the same goal STOP Will you join us STOP the Earl said, after I had exchanged greetings with
him, and Lady Muriel, and Captain Lindon STOP This restless young man is
expecting a telegram, and we are going to the Station to meet it STOP There is also a restless young woman in the case, Lady Muriel added STOP That goes without saying, my child, said her father STOP Women are
_always_ restless STOP For generous appreciation of all ones _best_ qualities, his daughter
impressively remarked, theres nothing to compare with a father, is
there, Eric STOP Cousins are not in it, said Eric: and then somehow the conversation
lapsed into two duologues, the younger folk taking the lead, and the two
old men following with less eager steps STOP And when are we to see your little friends again STOP said the Earl STOP They
are singularly attractive children STOP I shall be delighted to bring them, when I can, I said STOP But I dont
know, myself, when I am likely to see them again STOP Im not going to question you, said the Earl: but theres no harm in
mentioning that Muriel is simply tormented with curiosity STOP We know most
of the people about here, and she has been vainly trying to guess what
house they can possibly be staying at STOP Some day I may be able to enlighten her: but just at present

Thanks STOP She must bear it as best she can STOP _I_ tell her its a grand
opportunity for practising _patience_ STOP But she hardly sees it from that
point of view STOP Why, there _are_ the children STOP So indeed they were: waiting (for _us_, apparently) at a stile, which
they could not have climbed over more than a few moments, as Lady Muriel
and her cousin had passed it without seeing them STOP On catching sight of
us, Bruno ran to meet us, and to exhibit to us, with much pride, the
handle of a clasp-knifethe blade having been broken offwhich he had
picked up in the road STOP And what shall you use it for, Bruno STOP I said STOP Dont know, Bruno carelessly replied: must think STOP A childs first view of life, the Earl remarked, with that sweet sad
smile of his, is that it is a period to be spent in accumulating
portable property STOP That view gets modified as the years glide away STOP And
he held out his hand to Sylvie, who had placed herself by me, looking a
little shy of him STOP But the gentle old man was not one with whom any child, human or fairy,
could be shy for long; and she had very soon deserted my hand for
hisBruno alone remaining faithful to his first friend STOP We overtook the
other couple just as they reached the Station, and both Lady Muriel and
Eric greeted the children as old friendsthe latter with the words So
you got to Babylon by candlelight, after all STOP Yes, and back again STOP cried Bruno STOP Lady Muriel looked from one to the other in blank astonishment STOP What,
_you_ know them, Eric STOP she exclaimed STOP This mystery grows deeper every
day STOP Then we must be somewhere in the Third Act, said Eric STOP You dont
expect the mystery to be cleared up till the Fifth Act, do you STOP But its such a _long_ drama STOP was the plaintive reply STOP We _must_ have
got to the Fifth Act by this time STOP _Third_ Act, I assure you, said the young soldier mercilessly STOP Scene,
a railway-platform STOP Lights down STOP Enter Prince (in disguise, of course)
and faithful Attendant STOP _This_ is the Prince (taking Brunos hand)
and here stands his humble Servant STOP What is your Royal Highnesss next
command STOP And he made a most courtier-like low bow to his puzzled little
friend STOP Oore _not_ a Servant STOP Bruno scornfully exclaimed STOP Oore a
_Gemplun_ STOP _Servant_, I assure your Royal Highness STOP Eric respectfully insisted STOP Allow me to mention to your Royal Highness my various situationspast,
present, and future STOP What did oo begin wiz STOP Bruno asked, beginning to enter into the jest STOP Was oo a shoe-black STOP Lower than that, your Royal Highness STOP Years ago, I offered myself as a
_Slave_as a _Confidential_ Slave, I think its called STOP he asked,
turning to Lady Muriel STOP But Lady Muriel heard him not: something had gone wrong with her glove,
which entirely engrossed her attention STOP Did oo get the place STOP said Bruno STOP Sad to say, Your Royal Highness, I did _not_ STOP So I had to take a
situation asas _Waiter_, which I have now held for some yearshavent
I STOP He again glanced at Lady Muriel STOP Sylvie dear, _do_ help me to button this glove STOP Lady Muriel whispered,
hastily stooping down, and failing to hear the question STOP And what will oo be _next_ STOP said Bruno STOP My next place will, I hope, be that of _Groom_ STOP And after that

Dont puzzle the child so STOP Lady Muriel interrupted STOP What nonsense you
talk STOP after that, Eric persisted, I hope to obtain the situation of
_Housekeeper_, which_Fourth Act!_ he proclaimed, with a sudden change
of tone STOP Lights turned up STOP Red lights STOP Green lights STOP Distant rumble
heard STOP Enter a passenger-train STOP And in another minute the train drew up alongside of the platform, and a
stream of passengers began to flow out from the booking office and
waiting-rooms STOP Did you ever make _real_ life into a drama STOP said the Earl STOP Now just
try STOP Ive often amused myself that way STOP Consider this platform as our
stage STOP Good entrances and exits on _both_ sides, you see STOP Capital
background scene: real engine moving up and down STOP All this bustle, and
people passing to and fro, must have been most carefully rehearsed STOP How
naturally they do it STOP With never a glance at the audience STOP And every
grouping is quite fresh, you see STOP No repetition STOP It really was admirable, as soon as I began to enter into it from this
point of view STOP Even a porter passing, with a barrow piled with luggage,
seemed so realistic that one was tempted to applaud STOP He was followed by
an angry mother, with hot red face, dragging along two screaming
children, and calling, to some one behind, John STOP Come on STOP Enter John,
very meek, very silent, and loaded with parcels STOP And he was followed, in
his turn, by a frightened little nursemaid, carrying a fat baby, also
screaming STOP All the children screamed STOP Capital byplay STOP said the old man aside STOP Did you notice the
nursemaids look of terror STOP It was simply _perfect_ STOP You have struck quite a new vein, I said STOP To most of us Life and its
pleasures seem like a mine that is nearly worked out STOP Worked out STOP exclaimed the Earl STOP For any one with true dramatic
instincts, it is only the Overture that is ended STOP The real treat has yet
to begin STOP You go to a theatre, and pay your ten shillings for a stall,
and what do you get for your money STOP Perhaps its a dialogue between a
couple of farmersunnatural in their overdone caricature of farmers
dressmore unnatural in their constrained attitudes and gesturesmost
unnatural in their attempts at ease and geniality in their talk STOP Go
instead and take a seat in a third-class railway-carriage, and youll
get the same dialogue done _to the life_ STOP Front-seatsno orchestra to
block the viewand nothing to pay STOP Which reminds me, said Eric STOP There is nothing to pay on receiving a
telegram STOP Shall we enquire for one STOP And he and Lady Muriel strolled off
in the direction of the Telegraph-Office STOP I wonder if Shakespeare had that thought in his mind, I said, when he
wrote All the worlds a stage STOP The old man sighed STOP And so it is, he said, look at it as you will STOP Life is indeed a drama; a drama with but few _encores_and no
_bouquets_ STOP he added dreamily STOP We spend one half of it in regretting
the things we did in the other half STOP And the secret of _enjoying_ it, he continued, resuming his cheerful
tone, is _intensity_ STOP But not in the modern sthetic sense, I presume STOP Like the young lady,
in Punch, who begins a conversation with Are you _intense_ STOP By no means STOP replied the Earl STOP What I mean is intensity of
_thought_a concentrated _attention_ STOP We lose half the pleasure we might
have in Life, by not really _attending_ STOP Take any instance you like: it
doesnt matter _how_ trivial the pleasure may bethe principle is the
same STOP Suppose _A_ and _B_ are reading the same second-rate
circulating-library novel STOP _A_ never troubles himself to master the
relationships of the characters, on which perhaps all the interest of
the story depends: he skips over all the descriptions of scenery, and
every passage that looks rather dull: he doesnt half attend to the
passages he does read: he goes on readingmerely from want of resolution
to find another occupationfor hours after he ought to have put the book
aside: and reaches the FINIS in a state of utter weariness and
depression STOP _B_ puts his whole soul _into_ the thingon the principle
that whatever is worth doing is worth doing _well_: he masters the
genealogies: he calls up pictures before his minds eye as he reads
about the scenery: best of all, he resolutely shuts the book at the end
of some chapter, while his interest is yet at its keenest, and turns to
other subjects; so that, when next he allows himself an hour at it, it
is like a hungry man sitting down to dinner: and, when the book is
finished, he returns to the work of his daily life like a giant
refreshed STOP But suppose the book were really _rubbish_nothing to repay attention STOP Well, suppose it, said the Earl STOP My theory meets _that_ case, I
assure you STOP _A_ never finds out that it _is_ rubbish, but maunders on to
the end, trying to believe hes enjoying himself STOP _B_ quietly shuts the
book, when hes read a dozen pages, walks off to the Library, and
changes it for a better STOP I have yet _another_ theory for adding to the
enjoyment of Lifethat is, if I have not exhausted your patience STOP Im
afraid you find me a very garrulous old man STOP No indeed STOP I exclaimed earnestly STOP And indeed I felt as if one _could_
not easily tire of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice STOP It is, that we should learn to take our pleasures _quickly_, and our
pains _slowly_ STOP But why STOP I should have put it the other way, myself STOP By taking _artificial_ painwhich can be as trivial as you
please_slowly_, the result is that, when _real_ pain comes, however
severe, all you need do is to let it go at its _ordinary_ pace, and its
over in a moment STOP Very true, I said, but how about the _pleasure_ STOP Why, by taking it quick, you can get so much more into life STOP It takes
_you_ three hours and a half to hear and enjoy an opera STOP Suppose _I_ can
take it in, and enjoy it, in half-an-hour STOP Why, I can enjoy _seven_
operas, while you are listening to _one_ STOP Always supposing you have an orchestra capable of _playing_ them, I
said STOP And that orchestra has yet to be found STOP The old man smiled STOP I have heard an air played, he said, and by no
means a short oneplayed right through, variations and all, in three
seconds STOP When STOP And how STOP I asked eagerly, with a half-notion that I was dreaming
again STOP It was done by a little musical-box, he quietly replied STOP After it had
been wound up, the regulator, or something, broke, and it ran down, as I
said, in about three seconds STOP But it _must_ have played all the notes,
you know STOP Did you _enjoy_ it STOP I asked, with all the severity of a
cross-examining barrister STOP No, I didnt STOP he candidly confessed STOP But then, you know, I hadnt
been trained to that kind of music STOP I should much like to _try_ your plan, I said, and, as Sylvie and
Bruno happened to run up to us at the moment, I left them to keep the
Earl company, and strolled along the platform, making each person and
event play its part in an _extempore_ drama for my especial benefit STOP What, is the Earl tired of you already STOP I said, as the children ran
past me STOP No STOP Sylvie replied with great emphasis STOP He wants the evening-paper STOP So Brunos going to be a little news-boy STOP Mind you charge a good price for it STOP I called after them STOP Returning up the platform, I came upon Sylvie alone STOP Well, child, I
said, wheres your little news-boy STOP Couldnt he get you an
evening-paper STOP He went to get one at the book-stall at the other side, said Sylvie;
and hes coming across the line with itoh, Bruno, you ought to cross
by the bridge STOP for the distant thud, thud, of the Express was already
audible STOP Suddenly a look of horror came over her face STOP Oh, hes fallen
down on the rails STOP she cried, and darted past me at a speed that quite
defied the hasty effort I made to stop her STOP But the wheezy old Station-Master happened to be close behind me: he
wasnt good for much, poor old man, but he was good for this; and,
before I could turn round, he had the child clasped in his arms, saved
from the certain death she was rushing to STOP So intent was I in watching
this scene, that I hardly saw a flying figure in a light grey suit, who
shot across from the back of the platform, and was on the line in
another second STOP So far as one could take note of time in such a moment
of horror he had about ten clear seconds, before the Express would be
upon him, in which to cross the rails and to pick up Bruno STOP Whether he
did so or not it was quite impossible to guess: the next thing one knew
was that the Express had passed, and that, whether for life or death,
all was over STOP When the cloud of dust had cleared away, and the line was
once more visible, we saw with thankful hearts that the child and his
deliverer were safe STOP All right STOP Eric called to us cheerfully, as he recrossed the line STOP Hes more frightened than hurt STOP [Illustration: CROSSING THE LINE]

He lifted the little fellow up into Lady Muriels arms, and mounted the
platform as gaily as if nothing had happened: but he was as pale as
death, and leaned heavily on the arm I hastily offered him, fearing he
was about to faint STOP Ill justsit down a moment he said dreamily:
wheres Sylvie STOP Sylvie ran to him, and flung her arms round his neck, sobbing as if her
heart would break STOP Dont do that, my darling STOP Eric murmured, with a
strange look in his eyes STOP Nothing to cry about now, you know STOP But you
very nearly got yourself killed for nothing STOP For Bruno STOP the little maiden sobbed STOP And he would have done it for
me STOP Wouldnt you, Bruno STOP Course I would STOP Bruno said, looking round with a bewildered air STOP Lady Muriel kissed him in silence as she put him down out of her arms STOP Then she beckoned Sylvie to come and take his hand, and signed to the
children to go back to where the Earl was seated STOP Tell him, she
whispered with quivering lips, tell himall is well STOP Then she turned
to the hero of the day STOP I thought it was _death_, she said STOP Thank
God, you are safe STOP Did you see how near it was STOP I saw there was just time, Eric said lightly STOP A soldier must learn to
carry his life in his hand, you know STOP Im all right now STOP Shall we go to
the telegraph-office again STOP I daresay its come by this time STOP I went to join the Earl and the children, and we waitedalmost in
silence, for no one seemed inclined to talk, and Bruno was half-asleep
on Sylvies laptill the others joined us STOP No telegram had come STOP Ill take a stroll with the children, I said, feeling that we were a
little _de trop_, and Ill look in, in the course of the evening STOP We must go back into the wood, now, Sylvie said, as soon as we were
out of hearing STOP We cant stay this size any longer STOP Then you will be quite tiny Fairies again, next time we meet STOP Yes, said Sylvie: but well be children again some dayif youll let
us STOP Brunos very anxious to see Lady Muriel again STOP She are _welly_ nice, said Bruno STOP I shall be very glad to take you to see her again, I said STOP Hadnt I
better give you back the Professors Watch STOP Itll be too large for you
to carry when youre Fairies, you know STOP Bruno laughed merrily STOP I was glad to see he had quite recovered from the
terrible scene he had gone through STOP Oh no, it wont STOP he said STOP When
_we_ go small, _itll_ go small STOP And then itll go straight to the Professor, Sylvie added, and you
wont be able to use it any more: so youd better use it all you can,
_now_ STOP We _must_ go small when the sun sets STOP Good-bye STOP Good-bye STOP cried Bruno STOP But their voices sounded very far away, and,
when I looked round, both children had disappeared STOP And it wants only two hours to sunset STOP I said as I strolled on STOP I
must make the best of my time STOP  STOP AN OUTLANDISH WATCH STOP As I entered the little town, I came upon two of the fishermens wives
interchanging that last word which never was the last: and it occurred
to me, as an experiment with the Magic Watch, to wait till the little
scene was over, and then to encore it STOP Well, good night tye STOP And ye winna forget to send us word when your
Martha writes STOP Nay, ah winna forget STOP An if she isnt suited, she can but coom back STOP Good night tye STOP A casual observer might have thought and there ends the dialogue STOP That
casual observer would have been mistaken STOP Ah, shell like em, I warn ye STOP _Theyll_ not treat her bad, yer may
depend STOP Theyre varry canny fowk STOP Good night STOP Ay, they _are_ that STOP Good night STOP Good night STOP And yell send us word if she writes STOP Aye, ah will, yer may depend STOP Good night tye STOP And at last they parted STOP I waited till they were some twenty yards
apart, and then put the Watch a minute back STOP The instantaneous change
was startling: the two figures seemed to flash back into their former
places STOP isnt suited, she can but coom back STOP Good night tye STOP one of them was
saying: and so the whole dialogue was repeated, and, when they had
parted for the second time, I let them go their several ways, and
strolled on through the town STOP But the real usefulness of this magic power, I thought, would be to
undo some harm, some painful event, some accident I had not long to
wait for an opportunity of testing _this_ property also of the Magic
Watch, for, even as the thought passed through my mind, the accident I
was imagining occurred STOP A light cart was standing at the door of the
Great Millinery Depot of Elveston, laden with card-board
packing-cases, which the driver was carrying into the shop, one by one STOP One of the cases had fallen into the street, but it scarcely seemed
worth while to step forward and pick it up, as the man would be back
again in a moment STOP Yet, in that moment, a young man riding a bicycle
came sharp round the corner of the street and, in trying to avoid
running over the box, upset his machine, and was thrown headlong against
the wheel of the spring-cart STOP The driver ran out to his assistance, and
he and I together raised the unfortunate cyclist and carried him into
the shop STOP His head was cut and bleeding; and one knee seemed to be badly
injured; and it was speedily settled that he had better be conveyed at
once to the only Surgery in the place STOP I helped them in emptying the
cart, and placing in it some pillows for the wounded man to rest on; and
it was only when the driver had mounted to his place, and was starting
for the Surgery, that I bethought me of the strange power I possessed of
undoing all this harm STOP Now is my time STOP I said to myself, as I moved back the hand of the
Watch, and saw, almost without surprise this time, all things restored
to the places they had occupied at the critical moment when I had first
noticed the fallen packing-case STOP Instantly I stepped out into the street, picked up the box, and replaced
it in the cart: in the next moment the bicycle had spun round the
corner, passed the cart without let or hindrance, and soon vanished in
the distance, in a cloud of dust STOP Delightful power of magic STOP I thought STOP How much of human suffering I
havenot only relieved, but actually annihilated STOP And, in a glow of
conscious virtue, I stood watching the unloading of the cart, still
holding the Magic Watch open in my hand, as I was curious to see what
would happen when we again reached the exact time at which I had put
back the hand STOP The result was one that, if only I had considered the thing carefully, I
might have foreseen: as the hand of the Watch touched the mark, the
spring-cartwhich had driven off, and was by this time half-way down the
street, was back again at the door, and in the act of starting, whileoh
woe for the golden dream of world-wide benevolence that had dazzled my
dreaming fancy!the wounded youth was once more reclining on the heap of
pillows, his pale face set rigidly in the hard lines that told of pain
resolutely endured STOP Oh mocking Magic Watch STOP I said to myself, as I passed out of the
little town, and took the seaward road that led to my lodgings STOP The
good I fancied I could do is vanished like a dream: the evil of this
troublesome world is the only abiding reality STOP And now I must record an experience so strange, that I think it only
fair, before beginning to relate it, to release my much-enduring reader
from any obligation he may feel to believe this part of my story STOP _I_
would not have believed it, I freely confess, if I had not seen it with
my own eyes: then why should I expect it of my reader, who, quite
possibly, has never seen anything of the sort STOP I was passing a pretty little villa, which stood rather back from the
road, in its own grounds, with bright flower-beds in frontcreepers
wandering over the walls and hanging in festoons about the
bow-windowsan easy-chair forgotten on the lawn, with a newspaper lying
near ita small pug-dog couchant before it, resolved to guard the
treasure even at the sacrifice of lifeand a front-door standing
invitingly half-open STOP Here is my chance, I thought, for testing the
reverse action of the Magic Watch STOP I pressed the reversal-peg and
walked in STOP In _another_ house, the entrance of a stranger might cause
surpriseperhaps anger, even going so far as to expel the said stranger
with violence: but _here_, I knew, nothing of the sort could happen STOP The
_ordinary_ course of eventsfirst, to think nothing about me; then,
hearing my footsteps to look up and see me; and then to wonder what
business I had therewould be reversed by the action of my Watch STOP They
would _first_ wonder who I was, _then_ see me, then look down, and think
no more about me STOP And as to being expelled with violence, _that_ event
would necessarily come _first_ in this case STOP So, if I can once get
_in_, I said to myself, all risk of _expulsion_ will be over STOP [Illustration: THE PUG-DOG SAT UP]

The pug-dog sat up, as a precautionary measure, as I passed; but, as I
took no notice of the treasure he was guarding, he let me go by without
even one remonstrant bark STOP He that takes my life, he seemed to be
saying, wheezily, to himself, takes trash: But he that takes the _Daily
Telegraph_ STOP But this awful contingency I did not face STOP The party in the drawing-roomI had walked straight in, you understand,
without ringing the bell, or giving any notice of my approachconsisted
of four laughing rosy children, of ages from about fourteen down to ten,
who were, apparently, all coming towards the door (I found they were
really walking _backwards_), while their mother, seated by the fire with
some needlework on her lap, was saying, just as I entered the room,
Now, girls, you may get your things on for a walk STOP To my utter astonishmentfor I was not yet accustomed to the action of
the Watchall smiles ceased (as Browning says) on the four pretty
faces, and they all got out pieces of needle-work, and sat down STOP No one
noticed _me_ in the least, as I quietly took a chair and sat down to
watch them STOP When the needle-work had been unfolded, and they were all ready to
begin, their mother said Come, _thats_ done, at last STOP You may fold up
your work, girls STOP But the children took no notice whatever of the
remark; on the contrary, they set to work at once sewingif that is the
proper word to describe an operation such as _I_ had never before
witnessed STOP Each of them threaded her needle with a short end of thread
attached to the work, which was instantly pulled by an invisible force
through the stuff, dragging the needle after it: the nimble fingers of
the little sempstress caught it at the other side, but only to lose it
again the next moment STOP And so the work went on, steadily undoing itself,
and the neatly-stitched little dresses, or whatever they were, steadily
falling to pieces STOP Now and then one of the children would pause, as the
recovered thread became inconveniently long, wind it on a bobbin, and
start again with another short end STOP At last all the work was picked to pieces and put away, and the lady led
the way into the next room, walking backwards, and making the insane
remark Not yet, dear: we _must_ get the sewing done first STOP After
which, I was not surprised to see the children skipping backwards after
her, exclaiming Oh, mother, it _is_ such a lovely day for a walk STOP In the dining-room, the table had only dirty plates and empty dishes on
it STOP However the partywith the addition of a gentleman, as good-natured,
and as rosy, as the childrenseated themselves at it very contentedly STOP You have seen people eating cherry-tart, and every now and then
cautiously conveying a cherry-stone from their lips to their plates STOP Well, something like that went on all through this ghastlyor shall we
say ghostly?banquet STOP An empty fork is raised to the lips: there it
receives a neatly-cut piece of mutton, and swiftly conveys it to the
plate, where it instantly attaches itself to the mutton already there STOP Soon one of the plates, furnished with a complete slice of mutton and
two potatoes, was handed up to the presiding gentleman, who quietly
replaced the slice on the joint, and the potatoes in the dish STOP Their conversation was, if possible, more bewildering than their mode of
dining STOP It began by the youngest girl suddenly, and without provocation,
addressing her eldest sister STOP Oh, you _wicked_ story-teller STOP she said STOP I expected a sharp reply from the sister; but, instead of this, she
turned laughingly to her father, and said, in a very loud stage-whisper,
To be a bride STOP The father, in order to do _his_ part in a conversation that seemed only
fit for lunatics, replied Whisper it to me, dear STOP But she _didnt_ whisper (these children never did anything they were
told): she said, quite loud, Of course not STOP Everybody knows what
_Dolly_ wants STOP And little Dolly shrugged her shoulders, and said, with a pretty
pettishness, Now, Father, youre not to tease STOP You know I dont want to
be brides-maid to _anybody_ STOP And Dollys to be the fourth, was her fathers idiotic reply STOP Here Number Three put in her oar STOP Oh, it _is_ settled, Mother dear,
really and truly STOP Mary told us all about it STOP Its to be next Tuesday
four weeksand three of her cousins are coming to be
brides-maidsand

_She_ doesnt forget it, Minnie STOP the Mother laughingly replied STOP I do
wish theyd get it settled STOP I dont like long engagements STOP And Minnie wound up the conversationif so chaotic a series of remarks
deserves the namewith Only think STOP We passed the Cedars this morning,
just exactly as Mary Davenant was standing at the gate, wishing good-bye
to MisterI forget his name STOP Of course we looked the other way STOP By this time I was so hopelessly confused that I gave up listening, and
followed the dinner down into the kitchen STOP But to you, O hypercritical reader, resolute to believe no item of this
weird adventure, what need to tell how the mutton was placed on the
spit, and slowly unroastedhow the potatoes were wrapped in their skins,
and handed over to the gardener to be buriedhow, when the mutton had at
length attained to rawness, the fire, which had gradually changed from
red-heat to a mere blaze, died down so suddenly that the cook had only
just time to catch its last flicker on the end of a matchor how the
maid, having taken the mutton off the spit, carried it (backwards, of
course) out of the house, to meet the butcher, who was coming (also
backwards) down the road STOP The longer I thought over this strange adventure, the more hopelessly
tangled the mystery became: and it was a real relief to meet Arthur in
the road, and get him to go with me up to the Hall, to learn what news
the telegraph had brought STOP I told him, as we went, what had happened at
the Station, but as to my further adventures I thought it best, for the
present, to say nothing STOP The Earl was sitting alone when we entered STOP I am glad you are come in
to keep me company, he said STOP Muriel is gone to bedthe excitement of
that terrible scene was too much for herand Eric has gone to the hotel
to pack his things, to start for London by the early train STOP Then the telegram has come STOP I said STOP Did you not hear STOP Oh, I had forgotten: it came in after you left the
Station STOP Yes, its all right: Eric has got his commission; and, now that
he has arranged matters with Muriel, he has business in town that must
be seen to at once STOP What arrangement do you mean STOP I asked with a sinking heart, as the
thought of Arthurs crushed hopes came to my mind STOP Do you mean that
they are _engaged_ STOP They have been engagedin a sensefor two years, the old man gently
replied: that is, he has had my promise to consent to it, so soon as he
could secure a permanent and settled line in life STOP I could never be
happy with my child married to a man without an object to live
forwithout even an object to die for STOP I hope they will be happy, a strange voice said STOP The speaker was
evidently in the room, but I had not heard the door open, and I looked
round in some astonishment STOP The Earl seemed to share my surprise STOP Who
spoke STOP he exclaimed STOP It was I, said Arthur, looking at us with a worn, haggard face, and
eyes from which the light of life seemed suddenly to have faded STOP And
let me wish _you_ joy also, dear friend, he added, looking sadly at the
Earl, and speaking in the same hollow tones that had startled us so
much STOP Thank you, the old man said, simply and heartily STOP A silence followed: then I rose, feeling sure that Arthur would wish to
be alone, and bade our gentle host Good night: Arthur took his hand,
but said nothing: nor did he speak again, as we went home, till we were
in the house and had lit our bed-room candles STOP Then he said, more to
himself than to me, _The heart knoweth its own bitterness_ STOP I never
understood those words till now STOP The next few days passed wearily enough STOP I felt no inclination to call
again, by myself, at the Hall; still less to propose that Arthur should
go with me: it seemed better to wait till Timethat gentle healer of our
bitterest sorrowsshould have helped him to recover from the first shock
of the disappointment that had blighted his life STOP Business, however, soon demanded my presence in town; and I had to
announce to Arthur that I must leave him for a while STOP But I hope to run
down again in a month, I added STOP I would stay now, if I could STOP I dont
think its good for you to be alone STOP No, I cant face solitude, _here_, for long, said Arthur STOP But dont
think about _me_ STOP I have made up my mind to accept a post in India, that
has been offered me STOP Out there, I suppose I shall find something to live
for; I cant see _anything_ at present STOP _This life of mine I guard, as
Gods high gift, from scathe and wrong, Not greatly care to lose!_

Yes, I said: your name-sake bore as heavy a blow, and lived through
it STOP A far heavier one than _mine_, said Arthur STOP The woman _he_ loved
proved false STOP There is no such cloud as _that_ on my memory ofof He
left the name unuttered, and went on hurriedly STOP But _you_ will return,
will you not STOP Yes, I shall come back for a short time STOP Do, said Arthur: and you shall write and tell me of our friends STOP Ill
send you my address when Im settled down STOP  STOP THE FROGS BIRTHDAY-TREAT STOP And so it came to pass that, just a week after the day when my
Fairy-friends first appeared as Children, I found myself taking a
farewell-stroll through the wood, in the hope of meeting them once more STOP I had but to stretch myself on the smooth turf, and the eerie feeling
was on me in a moment STOP Put oor ear _welly_ low down, said Bruno, and Ill tell oo a secret STOP Its the Frogs Birthday-Treatand weve lost the Baby STOP _What_ Baby STOP I said, quite bewildered by this complicated piece of
news STOP The _Queens_ Baby, a course STOP said Bruno STOP Titanias Baby STOP And wes
_welly_ sorry STOP Sylvie, shesoh so sorry STOP _How_ sorry is she STOP I asked, mischievously STOP Three-quarters of a yard, Bruno replied with perfect solemnity STOP And
_Im_ a little sorry too, he added, shutting his eyes so as not to see
that he was smiling STOP And what are you doing about the Baby STOP Well, the _soldiers_ are all looking for itup and downeverywhere STOP The _soldiers_ STOP I exclaimed STOP Yes, a course STOP said Bruno STOP When theres no fighting to be done, the
soldiers doos any little odd jobs, oo know STOP I was amused at the idea of its being a little odd job to find the
Royal Baby STOP But how did you come to lose it STOP I asked STOP We put it in a flower, Sylvie, who had just joined us, explained with
her eyes full of tears STOP Only we cant remember _which_ STOP She says _us_ put it in a flower, Bruno interrupted, cause she
doosnt want _I_ to get punished STOP But it were really _me_ what put it
there STOP _Sylvie_ were picking Dindledums STOP [Illustration: THE QUEENS BABY]

You shouldnt say _us_ put it in a flower, Sylvie very gravely
remarked STOP Well, _hus_, then, said Bruno STOP I never _can_ remember those horrid
Hs STOP Let me help you to look for it, I said STOP So Sylvie and I made a voyage
of discovery among all the flowers; but there was no Baby to be seen STOP Whats become of Bruno STOP I said, when we had completed our tour STOP Hes down in the ditch there, said Sylvie, amusing a young Frog STOP I went down on my hands and knees to look for him, for I felt very
curious to know how young Frogs _ought_ to be amused STOP After a minutes
search, I found him sitting at the edge of the ditch, by the side of the
little Frog, and looking rather disconsolate STOP How are you getting on, Bruno STOP I said, nodding to him as he looked up STOP Cant amuse it no more, Bruno answered, very dolefully, cause it
wont say what it would like to do next STOP Ive showed it all the
duck-weedsand a live caddis-wormbut it wont say nuffin STOP Whatwould
oolike STOP he shouted into the ear of the Frog: but the little creature
sat quite still, and took no notice of him STOP Its deaf, I think STOP Bruno
said, turning away with a sigh STOP And its time to get the Theatre
ready STOP Who are the audience to be STOP Only but Frogs, said Bruno STOP But they havent comed yet STOP They wants to
be drove up, like sheep STOP Would it save time, I suggested, if _I_ were to walk round with
Sylvie, to drive up the Frogs, while _you_ get the Theatre ready STOP That _are_ a good plan STOP cried Bruno STOP But where _are_ Sylvie STOP Im here STOP said Sylvie, peeping over the edge of the bank STOP I was just
watching two Frogs that were having a race STOP Which won it STOP Bruno eagerly inquired STOP Sylvie was puzzled STOP He _does_ ask such hard questions STOP she confided to
me STOP And whats to happen in the Theatre STOP I asked STOP First they have their Birthday-Feast, Sylvie said: then Bruno does
some Bits of Shakespeare; then he tells them a Story STOP I should think the Frogs like the Feast best STOP Dont they STOP Well, theres generally very few of them that get any STOP They _will_ keep
their mouths shut so tight STOP And its just as well they _do_, she added,
because Bruno likes to cook it himself: and he cooks _very_ queerly STOP Now theyre all in STOP Would you just help me to put them with their heads
the right way STOP We soon managed this part of the business, though the Frogs kept up a
most discontented croaking all the time STOP What _are_ they saying STOP I asked Sylvie STOP Theyre saying Fork STOP Fork STOP Its very silly of them STOP Youre not going
to _have_ forks STOP she announced with some severity STOP Those that want any
Feast have just got to open their mouths, and Brunoll put some of it
in STOP At this moment Bruno appeared, wearing a little white apron to show that
he was a Cook, and carrying a tureen full of very queer-looking soup STOP I
watched very carefully as he moved about among the Frogs; but I could
not see that _any_ of them opened their mouths to be fedexcept one very
young one, and Im nearly sure it did it accidentally, in yawning STOP However Bruno instantly put a large spoonful of soup into its mouth, and
the poor little thing coughed violently for some time STOP So Sylvie and I had to share the soup between us, and to _pretend_ to
enjoy it, for it certainly was _very_ queerly cooked STOP I only ventured to take _one_ spoonful of it (Sylvies Summer-Soup,
Bruno said it was), and must candidly confess that it was not _at all_
nice; and I could not feel surprised that so many of the guests had kept
their mouths shut up tight STOP Whats the soup _made_ of, Bruno STOP said Sylvie, who had put a spoonful
of it to her lips, and was making a wry face over it STOP And Brunos answer was anything but encouraging STOP Bits of things STOP The entertainment was to conclude with Bits of Shakespeare, as Sylvie
expressed it, which were all to be done by Bruno, Sylvie being fully
engaged in making the Frogs keep their heads towards the stage: after
which Bruno was to appear in his real character, and tell them a Story
of his own invention STOP Will the Story have a Moral to it STOP I asked Sylvie, while Bruno was
away behind the hedge, dressing for the first Bit STOP I _think_ so, Sylvie replied doubtfully STOP There generally _is_ a
Moral, only he puts it in too soon STOP And will he _say_ all the Bits of Shakespeare STOP No, hell only _act_ them, said Sylvie STOP He knows hardly any of the
words STOP When I see what hes dressed like, Ive to tell the Frogs what
character it is STOP Theyre always in such a hurry to guess STOP Dont you hear
them all saying What STOP What STOP And so indeed they were: it had only
sounded like croaking, till Sylvie explained it, but I could now make
out the Wawt STOP Wawt STOP quite distinctly STOP But why do they try to guess it before they see it STOP I dont know, Sylvie said: but they always _do_ STOP Sometimes they begin
guessing weeks and weeks before the day STOP (So now, when you hear the Frogs croaking in a particularly melancholy
way, you may be sure theyre trying to guess Brunos next Shakespeare
Bit STOP Isnt _that_ interesting? STOP However, the chorus of guessing was cut short by Bruno, who suddenly
rushed on from behind the scenes, and took a flying leap down among the
Frogs, to re-arrange them STOP For the oldest and fattest Frogwho had never been properly arranged so
that he could see the stage, and so had no idea what was going onwas
getting restless, and had upset several of the Frogs, and turned others
round with their heads the wrong way STOP And it was no good at all, Bruno
said, to do a Bit of Shakespeare when there was nobody to look at it
(you see he didnt count _me_ as anybody) STOP So he set to work with a
stick, stirring them up, very much as you would stir up tea in a cup,
till most of them had at least _one_ great stupid eye gazing at the
stage STOP _Oo_ must come and sit among them, Sylvie, he said in despair, Ive
put these two side-by-side, with their noses the same way, ever so many
times, but they _do_ squarrel so STOP So Sylvie took her place as Mistress of the Ceremonies, and Bruno
vanished again behind the scenes, to dress for the first Bit STOP Hamlet STOP was suddenly proclaimed, in the clear sweet tones I knew so
well STOP The croaking all ceased in a moment, and I turned to the stage, in
some curiosity to see what Brunos ideas were as to the behaviour of
Shakespeares greatest Character STOP According to this eminent interpreter of the Drama, Hamlet wore a short
black cloak (which he chiefly used for muffling up his face, as if he
suffered a good deal from toothache), and turned out his toes very much
as he walked STOP To be or not to be STOP Hamlet remarked in a cheerful tone,
and then turned head-over-heels several times, his cloak dropping off in
the performance STOP I felt a little disappointed: Brunos conception of the part seemed so
wanting in dignity STOP Wont he say any more of the speech STOP I whispered
to Sylvie STOP I _think_ not, Sylvie whispered in reply STOP He generally turns
head-over-heels when he doesnt know any more words STOP Bruno had meanwhile settled the question by disappearing from the stage;
and the Frogs instantly began inquiring the name of the next Character STOP Youll know directly STOP cried Sylvie, as she adjusted two or three young
Frogs that had struggled round with their backs to the stage STOP Macbeth STOP she added, as Bruno re-appeared STOP Macbeth had something twisted round him, that went over one shoulder and
under the other arm, and was meant, I believe, for a Scotch plaid STOP He
had a thorn in his hand, which he held out at arms length, as if he
were a little afraid of it STOP Is this a _dagger_ STOP Macbeth inquired, in a
puzzled sort of tone: and instantly a chorus of Thorn STOP Thorn STOP arose
from the Frogs (I had quite learned to understand their croaking by this
time) STOP Its a _dagger_ STOP Sylvie proclaimed in a peremptory tone STOP Hold your
tongues STOP And the croaking ceased at once STOP Shakespeare has not told us, so far as I know, that Macbeth had any such
eccentric habit as turning head-over-heels in private life: but Bruno
evidently considered it quite an essential part of the character, and
left the stage in a series of somersaults STOP However, he was back again in
a few moments, having tucked under his chin the end of a tuft of wool
(probably left on the thorn by a wandering sheep), which made a
magnificent beard, that reached nearly down to his feet STOP Shylock STOP Sylvie proclaimed STOP No, I beg your pardon STOP she hastily
corrected herself, King Lear STOP I hadnt noticed the crown STOP (Bruno had
very cleverly provided one, which fitted him exactly, by cutting out the
centre of a dandelion to make room for his head. STOP King Lear folded his arms (to the imminent peril of his beard) and said,
in a mild explanatory tone, Ay, every _inch_ a king STOP and then paused,
as if to consider how this could best be proved STOP And here, with all
possible deference to Bruno as a Shakespearian critic, I _must_ express
my opinion that the poet did _not_ mean his three great tragic heroes to
be so strangely alike in their personal habits; nor do I believe that he
would have accepted the faculty of turning head-over-heels as any proof
at all of royal descent STOP Yet it appeared that King Lear, after deep
meditation, could think of no other argument by which to prove his
kingship: and, as this was the last of the Bits of Shakespeare (We
never do more than _three_, Sylvie explained in a whisper), Bruno gave
the audience quite a long series of somersaults before he finally
retired, leaving the enraptured Frogs all crying out More STOP More STOP which
I suppose was their way of encoring a performance STOP But Bruno wouldnt
appear again, till the proper time came for telling the Story STOP [Illustration: THE FROGS BIRTHDAY-TREAT]

When he appeared at last in his _real_ character, I noticed a remarkable
change in his behaviour STOP He tried no more somersaults STOP It was clearly
his opinion that, however suitable the habit of turning head-over-heels
might be to such petty individuals as Hamlet and King Lear, it would
never do for _Bruno_ to sacrifice his dignity to such an extent STOP But it
was equally clear that he did not feel entirely at his ease, standing
all alone on the stage, with no costume to disguise him: and though he
began, several times, There were a Mouse, he kept glancing up and
down, and on all sides, as if in search of more comfortable quarters
from which to tell the Story STOP Standing on one side of the stage, and
partly overshadowing it, was a tall fox-glove, which seemed, as the
evening breeze gently swayed it hither and thither, to offer exactly the
sort of accommodation that the orator desired STOP Having once decided on
his quarters, it needed only a second or two for him to run up the stem
like a tiny squirrel, and to seat himself astride on the topmost bend,
where the fairy-bells clustered most closely, and from whence he could
look down on his audience from such a height that all shyness vanished,
and he began his Story merrily STOP Once there were a Mouse and a Crocodile and a Man and a Goat and a
Lion STOP I had never heard the dramatis person tumbled into a story
with such profusion and in such reckless haste; and it fairly took my
breath away STOP Even Sylvie gave a little gasp, and allowed three of the
Frogs, who seemed to be getting tired of the entertainment, to hop away
into the ditch, without attempting to stop them STOP And the Mouse found a Shoe, and it thought it were a Mouse-trap STOP So it
got right in, and it stayed in ever so long STOP Why did it _stay_ in STOP said Sylvie STOP Her function seemed to be much the
same as that of the Chorus in a Greek Play: she had to encourage the
orator, and draw him out, by a series of intelligent questions STOP Cause it thought it couldnt get out again, Bruno explained STOP It were
a clever mouse STOP It knew it couldnt get out of traps STOP But why did it go in at all STOP said Sylvie STOP and it jamp, and it jamp, Bruno proceeded, ignoring this question,
and at last it got right out again STOP And it looked at the mark in the
Shoe STOP And the Mans name were in it STOP So it knew it wasnt its own Shoe STOP Had it thought it _was_ STOP said Sylvie STOP Why, didnt I tell oo it thought it were a _Mouse-trap_ STOP the indignant
orator replied STOP Please, Mister Sir, will oo make Sylvie attend STOP Sylvie
was silenced, and was all attention: in fact, she and I were most of the
audience now, as the Frogs kept hopping away, and there were very few of
them left STOP So the Mouse gave the Man his Shoe STOP And the Man were welly glad, cause
he hadnt got but one Shoe, and he were hopping to get the other STOP Here I ventured on a question STOP Do you mean hopping, or hoping STOP Bofe, said Bruno STOP And the Man took the Goat out of the Sack STOP (We
havent heard of the _sack_ before, I said STOP Nor you wont hear of it
again, said Bruno) STOP And he said to the Goat, Oo will walk about here
till I comes back STOP And he went and he tumbled into a deep hole STOP And the
Goat walked round and round STOP And it walked under the Tree STOP And it wug
its tail STOP And it looked up in the Tree STOP And it sang a sad little Song STOP Oo never heard such a sad little Song STOP Can you sing it, Bruno STOP I asked STOP Iss, I can, Bruno readily replied STOP And I sant STOP It would make Sylvie
cry

It wouldnt STOP Sylvie interrupted in great indignation STOP And I dont
believe the Goat sang it at all STOP It did, though STOP said Bruno STOP It singed it right froo STOP I _sawed_ it
singing with its long beard

It couldnt sing with its _beard_, I said, hoping to puzzle the little
fellow: a beard isnt a _voice_ STOP Well then, _oo_ couldnt walk with Sylvie STOP Bruno cried triumphantly STOP Sylvie isnt a _foot_ STOP I thought I had better follow Sylvies example, and be silent for a
while STOP Bruno was too sharp for us STOP And when it had singed all the Song, it ran awayfor to get along to
look for the Man, oo know STOP And the Crocodile got along after itfor to
bite it, oo know STOP And the Mouse got along after the Crocodile STOP Wasnt the Crocodile _running_ STOP Sylvie enquired STOP She appealed to me STOP Crocodiles do run, dont they STOP I suggested crawling as the proper word STOP He wasnt running, said Bruno, and he wasnt crawling STOP He went
struggling along like a portmanteau STOP And he held his chin ever so high
in the air

What did he do _that_ for STOP said Sylvie STOP Cause he hadnt got a toofache STOP said Bruno STOP Cant oo make out
_nuffin_ wizout I splain it STOP Why, if hed had a toofache, a course hed
have held his head downlike thisand hed have put a lot of warm
blankets round it STOP If hed _had_ any blankets, Sylvie argued STOP Course he _had_ blankets STOP retorted her brother STOP Doos oo think
Crocodiles goes walks wizout blankets STOP And he frowned with his eyebrows STOP And the Goat was welly flightened at his eyebrows STOP Id never be afraid of _eyebrows_ STOP exclaimed Sylvie STOP I should think oo _would_, though, if theyd got a Crocodile fastened
to them, like these had STOP And so the Man jamp, and he jamp, and at last
he got right out of the hole STOP Sylvie gave another little gasp: this rapid dodging about among the
characters of the Story had taken away her breath STOP And he runned awayfor to look for the Goat, oo know STOP And he heard the
Lion grunting

Lions dont grunt, said Sylvie STOP This one did, said Bruno STOP And its mouth were like a large cupboard STOP And it had plenty of room in its mouth STOP And the Lion runned after the
Manfor to eat him, oo know STOP And the Mouse runned after the Lion STOP But the Mouse was running after the _Crocodile_, I said: he couldnt
run after _both_ STOP Bruno sighed over the density of his audience, but explained very
patiently STOP He _did_ runned after _bofe_: cause they went the same way STOP And first he caught the Crocodile, and then he didnt catch the Lion STOP And when hed caught the Crocodile, what doos oo think he didcause
hed got pincers in his pocket STOP I cant guess, said Sylvie STOP [Illustration: HE WRENCHED OUT THAT CROCODILES TOOF! STOP Nobody couldnt guess it STOP Bruno cried in high glee STOP Why, he wrenched
out that Crocodiles toof STOP _Which_ tooth STOP I ventured to ask STOP But Bruno was not to be puzzled STOP The toof he were going to bite the
Goat with, a course STOP He couldnt be sure about that, I argued, unless he wrenched out
_all_ its teeth STOP Bruno laughed merrily, and half sang, as he swung himself backwards and
forwards, He didwrenchedout_all_ its teef STOP Why did the Crocodile wait to have them wrenched out STOP said Sylvie STOP It had to wait, said Bruno STOP I ventured on another question STOP But what became of the Man who said
You may wait here till I come back STOP He didnt say Oo _may_, Bruno explained STOP He said, Oo _will_ STOP Just
like Sylvie says to me Oo will do oor lessons till twelve oclock STOP Oh,
I _wiss_, he added with a little sigh, I _wiss_ Sylvie would say Oo
_may_ do oor lessons STOP This was a dangerous subject for discussion, Sylvie seemed to think STOP She
returned to the Story STOP But what became of the Man STOP Well, the Lion springed at him STOP But it came so slow, it were three
weeks in the air

Did the Man wait for it all that time STOP I said STOP Course he didnt STOP Bruno replied, gliding head-first down the stem of
the fox-glove, for the Story was evidently close to its end STOP He sold
his house, and he packed up his things, while the Lion were coming STOP And
he went and he lived in another town STOP So the Lion ate the wrong man STOP This was evidently the Moral: so Sylvie made her final proclamation to
the Frogs STOP The Storys finished STOP And whatever is to be _learned_ from
it, she added, aside to me, Im sure _I_ dont know STOP I did not feel _quite_ clear about it myself, so made no suggestion: but
the Frogs seemed quite content, Moral or no Moral, and merely raised a
husky chorus of Off STOP Off STOP as they hopped away STOP  STOP LOOKING EASTWARD STOP Its just a week, I said, three days later, to Arthur, since we heard
of Lady Muriels engagement STOP I think _I_ ought to call, at any rate, and
offer my congratulations STOP Wont you come with me STOP A pained expression passed over his face STOP When must you leave us STOP he
asked STOP By the first train on Monday STOP Wellyes, I _will_ come with you STOP It would seem strange and unfriendly
if I didnt STOP But this is only Friday STOP Give me till Sunday afternoon STOP I
shall be stronger then STOP Shading his eyes with one hand, as if half-ashamed of the tears that
were coursing down his cheeks, he held the other out to me STOP It trembled
as I clasped it STOP I tried to frame some words of sympathy; but they seemed poor and cold,
and I left them unspoken STOP Good night STOP was all I said STOP Good night, dear friend STOP he replied STOP There was a manly vigour in his
tone that convinced me he was wrestling with, and triumphing over, the
great sorrow that had so nearly wrecked his lifeand that, on the
stepping-stone of his dead self, he would surely rise to higher things STOP There was no chance, I was glad to think, as we set out on Sunday
afternoon, of meeting _Eric_ at the Hall, as he had returned to town the
day after his engagement was announced STOP _His_ presence might have
disturbed the calmthe almost unnatural calmwith which Arthur met the
woman who had won his heart, and murmured the few graceful words of
sympathy that the occasion demanded STOP Lady Muriel was perfectly radiant with happiness: sadness could not live
in the light of such a smile: and even Arthur brightened under it, and,
when she remarked You see Im watering my flowers, though it _is_ the
Sabbath-Day, his voice had almost its old ring of cheerfulness as he
replied Even on the Sabbath-Day works of mercy are allowed STOP But this
_isnt_ the Sabbath-Day STOP The Sabbath-Day has ceased to exist STOP I know its not _Saturday_, Lady Muriel replied: but isnt Sunday
often called the Christian Sabbath STOP It is so called, I think, in recognition of the _spirit_ of the Jewish
institution, that one day in seven should be a day of _rest_ STOP But I hold
that Christians are freed from the _literal_ observance of the Fourth
Commandment STOP Then where is our _authority_ for Sunday observance STOP We have, first, the fact that the seventh day was sanctified, when
God rested from the work of Creation STOP That is binding on us as
_Theists_ STOP Secondly, we have the fact that the Lords Day is a
_Christian_ institution STOP That is binding on us as _Christians_ STOP And your practical rules would be STOP First, as Theists, to keep it _holy_ in some special way, and to make
it, so far as is reasonably possible, a day of _rest_ STOP Secondly, as
_Christians_, to attend public worship STOP And what of _amusements_ STOP I would say of them, as of all kinds of _work_, whatever is innocent on
a week-day, is innocent on Sunday, provided it does not interfere with
the duties of the day STOP Then you would allow children to _play_ on Sunday STOP Certainly I should STOP Why make the day irksome to their restless
natures STOP I have a letter somewhere, said Lady Muriel, from an old friend,
describing the way in which Sunday was kept in her younger days STOP I will
fetch it for you STOP I had a similar description, _viva voce_, years ago, Arthur said when
she had left us, from a little girl STOP It was really touching to hear the
melancholy tone in which she said On Sunday I mustnt play with my
doll STOP On Sunday I mustnt run on the sands STOP On Sunday I mustnt dig in
the garden STOP Poor child STOP She had indeed abundant cause for hating
Sunday STOP Here is the letter, said Lady Muriel, returning STOP Let me read you a
piece of it STOP _When, as a child, I first opened my eyes on a Sunday-morning, a
  feeling of dismal anticipation, which began at least on the Friday,
  culminated STOP I knew what was before me, and my wish, if not my word,
  was Would God it were evening STOP It was no day of rest, but a day of
  texts, of catechisms (Watts), of tracts about converted swearers,
  godly char-women, and edifying deaths of sinners saved._

  _Up with the lark, hymns and portions of Scripture had to be learned
  by heart till 8 oclock, when there were family-prayers, then
  breakfast, which I was never able to enjoy, partly from the fast
  already undergone, and partly from the outlook I dreaded._

  _At 9 came Sunday-School; and it made me indignant to be put into the
  class with the village-children, as well as alarmed lest, by some
  mistake of mine, I should be put below them._

  _The Church-Service was a veritable Wilderness of Zin STOP I wandered in
  it, pitching the tabernacle of my thoughts on the lining of the square
  family-pew, the fidgets of my small brothers, and the horror of
  knowing that, on the Monday, I should have to write out, from memory,
  jottings of the rambling disconnected extempore sermon, which might
  have had any text but its own, and to stand or fall by the result._

  _This was followed by a cold dinner at 1_ (_servants to have_ no
  _work_), _Sunday-School again from 2 to 4, and Evening-Service at 6 STOP The intervals were perhaps the greatest trial of all, from the efforts
  I had to make, to be less than usually sinful, by reading books and
  sermons as barren as the Dead Sea STOP There was but one rosy spot, in the
  distance, all that day: that was bed-time, which never could come
  too early!_

Such teaching was well meant, no doubt, said Arthur; but it must have
driven many of its victims into deserting the Church-Services
altogether STOP Im afraid _I_ was a deserter this morning, she gravely said STOP I had
to write to Eric STOP Would youwould you mind my telling you something he
said about _prayer_ STOP It had never struck me in that light before STOP In what light STOP said Arthur STOP Why, that all Nature goes by fixed, regular lawsScience has proved
_that_ STOP So that asking God to _do_ anything (except of course praying
for _spiritual_ blessings) is to expect a miracle: and weve no right to
do _that_ STOP Ive not put it as well as _he_ did: but that was the outcome
of it, and it has confused me STOP Please tell me what you can say in answer
to it STOP I dont propose to discuss _Captain Lindons_ difficulties, Arthur
gravely replied; specially as he is not present STOP But, if it is _your_
difficulty, (his voice unconsciously took a tenderer tone) then I will
speak STOP It _is_ my difficulty, she said anxiously STOP Then I will begin by asking Why did you except _spiritual_ blessings STOP Is not your mind a part of Nature STOP Yes, but Free-Will comes in thereI can _choose_ this or that; and God
can influence my choice STOP Then you are not a Fatalist STOP Oh, no STOP she earnestly exclaimed STOP Thank God STOP Arthur said to himself, but in so low a whisper that only
_I_ heard it STOP You grant then that I can, by an act of free choice, move
this cup, suiting the action to the word, _this_ way or _that_ way STOP Yes, I grant it STOP Well, let us see how far the result is produced by fixed laws STOP The
_cup_ moves because certain mechanical forces are impressed on it by my
_hand_ STOP My _hand_ moves because certain forceselectric, magnetic, or
whatever nerve-force may prove to beare impressed on it by my
_brain_ STOP This nerve-force, stored in the brain, would probably be
traceable, if Science were complete, to chemical forces supplied to the
brain by the blood, and ultimately derived from the food I eat and the
air I breathe STOP But would not that be Fatalism STOP Where would Free-Will come in STOP In _choice_ of nerves, replied Arthur STOP The nerve-force in the brain
may flow just as naturally down one nerve as down another STOP We need
something more than a fixed Law of Nature to settle _which_ nerve shall
carry it STOP That something is Free-Will STOP Her eyes sparkled STOP I see what you mean STOP she exclaimed STOP Human
Free-Will is an exception to the system of fixed Law STOP Eric said
something like that STOP And then I think he pointed out that God can only
influence Nature by influencing Human Wills STOP So that we _might_
reasonably pray _give us this day our daily bread_, because many of
the causes that produce bread are under Mans control STOP But to pray for
rain, or fine weather, would be as unreasonable as she checked
herself, as if fearful of saying something irreverent STOP In a hushed, low tone, that trembled with emotion, and with the
solemnity of one in the presence of death, Arthur slowly replied _Shall
he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him?_ Shall we, the swarm
that in the noontide beam were born, feeling in ourselves the power to
direct, this way or that, the forces of Natureof _Nature_, of which we
form so trivial a partshall we, in our boundless arrogance, in our
pitiful conceit, _deny_ that power to the Ancient of Days STOP Saying, to
our Creator, Thus far and no further STOP Thou madest, but thou canst not
rule! STOP Lady Muriel had covered her face in her hands, and did not look up STOP She
only murmured Thanks, thanks STOP again and again STOP We rose to go STOP Arthur said, with evident effort, One word more STOP If you
would _know_ the power of Prayerin anything and everything that Man can
need_try_ it STOP _Ask, and it shall be given you._ I_have_ tried it STOP I
_know_ that God answers prayer STOP Our walk home was a silent one, till we had nearly reached the lodgings:
then Arthur murmuredand it was almost an echo of my own thoughts_What
knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?_

The subject was not touched on again STOP We sat on, talking, while hour
after hour, of this our last night together, glided away unnoticed STOP He
had much to tell me about India, and the new life he was going to, and
the _work_ he hoped to do STOP And his great generous soul seemed so filled
with noble ambition as to have no space left for any vain regret or
selfish repining STOP Come, it is nearly morning STOP Arthur said at last, rising and leading
the way upstairs STOP The sun will be rising in a few minutes: and, though
I _have_ basely defrauded you of your last chance of a nights rest
here, Im sure youll forgive me: for I really _couldnt_ bring myself
to say Good night sooner STOP And God knows whether youll ever see me
again, or hear of me STOP _Hear_ of you I am certain I shall STOP I warmly responded, and quoted the
concluding lines of that strange poem Waring:

                Oh, never star
  Was lost here, but it rose afar STOP Look East, where whole new thousands are STOP In Vishnu-land what Avatar STOP Aye, look Eastward STOP Arthur eagerly replied, pausing at the stair-case
window, which commanded a fine view of the sea and the eastward horizon STOP The West is the fitting tomb for all the sorrow and the sighing, all
the errors and the follies of the Past: for all its withered Hopes and
all its buried Loves STOP From the East comes new strength, new ambition,
new Hope, new Life, new Love STOP Look Eastward STOP Aye, look Eastward STOP His last words were still ringing in my ears as I entered my room, and
undrew the window-curtains, just in time to see the sun burst in glory
from his ocean-prison, and clothe the world in the light of a new day STOP So may it be for him, and me, and all of us STOP I mused STOP All that is
evil, and dead, and hopeless, fading with the Night that is past STOP All
that is good, and living, and hopeful, rising with the dawn of Day STOP Fading, with the Night, the chilly mists, and the noxious vapours, and
the heavy shadows, and the wailing gusts, and the owls melancholy
hootings: rising, with the Day, the darting shafts of light, and the
wholesome morning breeze, and the warmth of a dawning life, and the mad
music of the lark STOP Look Eastward STOP Fading, with the Night, the clouds of ignorance, and the deadly blight
of sin, and the silent tears of sorrow: and ever rising, higher, higher,
with the Day, the radiant dawn of knowledge, and the sweet breath of
purity, and the throb of a worlds ecstasy STOP Look Eastward STOP [Illustration: LOOK EASTWARD! STOP Fading, with the Night, the memory of a dead love, and the withered
leaves of a blighted hope, and the sickly repinings and moody regrets
that numb the best energies of the soul: and rising, broadening, rolling
upward like a living flood, the manly resolve, and the dauntless will,
and the heavenward gaze of faith_the substance of things hoped for, the
evidence of things not seen_ STOP Look Eastward STOP Aye, look Eastward STOP THE END STOP FOOTNOTES

  Dreams, that elude the Wakers frenzied grasp

  Which nevermore shall render clasp for clasp,
  Or deftly soothe a weeping Child to rest
  In suchlike forms me listeth to portray
  My Tale, here ended STOP Thou delicious Fay
  The guardian of a Sprite that lives to tease thee
  Loving in earnest, chiding but in play
  The merry mocking Bruno STOP Who, that sees thee,
  Can fail to love thee, Darling, even as I STOP My sweetest Sylvie, we must say Good-bye STOP PREFACE STOP I must begin with the same announcement as in the previous Volume (which
I shall henceforward refer to as Vol STOP I., calling the present Volume
Vol STOP II STOP ), viz STOP that the Locket, at p. 405, was drawn by Miss Alice
Havers STOP And my reason, for not stating this on the title-pagethat it
seems only due, to the artist of these wonderful pictures, that his name
should stand there alonehas, I think, even greater weight in Vol STOP II STOP than it had in Vol STOP I STOP Let me call especial attention to the three
Little Birds borders, at pp STOP 365, 371, 377 STOP The way, in which he has
managed to introduce the most minute details of the stanzas to be
illustrated, seems to me a triumph of artistic ingenuity STOP Let me here express my sincere gratitude to the many Reviewers who have
noticed, whether favorably or unfavorably, the previous Volume STOP Their
unfavorable remarks were, most probably, well-deserved; the favorable
ones less probably so STOP Both kinds have no doubt served to make the book
known, and have helped the reading Public to form their opinions of it STOP Let me also here assure them that it is not from any want of respect for
their criticisms, that I have carefully forborne from reading _any_ of
them STOP I am strongly of opinion that an author had far better _not_ read
any reviews of his books: the unfavorable ones are almost certain to
make him cross, and the favorable ones conceited; and _neither_ of these
results is desirable STOP Criticisms have, however, reached me from private sources, to some of
which I propose to offer a reply STOP One such critic complains that Arthurs strictures, on sermons and on
choristers, are too severe STOP Let me say, in reply, that I do _not_ hold
myself responsible for _any_ of the opinions expressed by the characters
in my book STOP They are simply opinions which, it seemed to me, might
probably be held by the persons into whose mouths I put them, and which
were worth consideration STOP Other critics have objected to certain innovations in spelling, such as
cant, wont, traveler STOP In reply, I can only plead my firm
conviction that the popular usage is _wrong_ STOP As to cant, it will
not be disputed that, in all _other_ words ending in nt, these
letters are an abbreviation of not; and it is surely absurd to suppose
that, in this solitary instance, not is represented by t STOP In fact
cant is the _proper_ abbreviation for can it, just as ist is for
is it STOP Again, in wont, the first apostrophe is needed, because the
word would is here _abridged_ into wo: but I hold it proper to spell
dont with only _one_ apostrophe, because the word do is here
_complete_ STOP As to such words as traveler, I hold the correct principle
to be, to _double_ the consonant when the accent falls on that syllable;
otherwise to leave it _single_ STOP This rule is observed in most cases
(e.g STOP we double the r in preferred, but leave it single in
offered), so that I am only extending, to other cases, an existing
rule STOP I admit, however, that I do not spell parallel, as the rule
would have it; but here we are constrained, by the etymology, to insert
the double l.


In the Preface to Vol STOP I. were two puzzles, on which my readers might
exercise their ingenuity STOP One was, to detect the 3 lines of padding,
which I had found it necessary to supply in the passage extending from
the top of p. 35 to the middle of p. 38 STOP They are the 14th, 15th, and
16th lines of p. 37 STOP The other puzzle was, to determine which (if any)
of the 8 stanzas of the Gardeners Song (see pp STOP 65, 78, 83, 90, 106,
116, 164, 168) were adapted to the context, and which (if any) had the
context adapted to them STOP The last of them is the only one that was
adapted to the context, the Garden-Door that opened with a key having
been substituted for some creature (a Cormorant, I think) that nestled
in a tree STOP At pp STOP 78, 106, and 164, the context was adapted to the
stanza STOP At p. 90, neither stanza nor context was altered: the connection
between them was simply a piece of good luck STOP In the Preface to Vol STOP I., at pp STOP ix., x., I gave an account of the
making-up of the story of Sylvie and Bruno STOP A few more details may
perhaps be acceptable to my Readers STOP It was in 1873, as I _now_ believe, that the idea first occurred to me
that a little fairy-tale (written, in 1867, for Aunt Judys Magazine,
under the title Brunos Revenge) might serve as the nucleus of a
longer story STOP This I surmise, from having found the original draft of
the last paragraph of Vol STOP II., dated 1873 STOP So that this paragraph has
been waiting 20 years for its chance of emerging into printmore than
twice the period so cautiously recommended by Horace for repressing
ones literary efforts STOP It was in February, 1885, that I entered into negotiations, with Mr.
Harry Furniss, for illustrating the book STOP Most of the substance of
_both_ Volumes was then in existence in manuscript: and my original
intention was to publish the _whole_ story at once STOP In September, 1885,
I received from Mr. Furniss the first set of drawingsthe four which
illustrate Peter and Paul (see I. pp STOP 144, 147, 150, 154): in
November, 1886, I received the second setthe three which illustrate the
Professors song about the little man who had a little gun (Vol STOP II STOP pp STOP 265, 266, 267): and in January, 1887, I received the third setthe
four which illustrate the Pig-Tale STOP So we went on, illustrating first one bit of the story, and then
another, without any idea of sequence STOP And it was not till March, 1889,
that, having calculated the number of pages the story would occupy, I
decided on dividing it into _two_ portions, and publishing it half at a
time STOP This necessitated the writing of a _sort_ of conclusion for the
first Volume: and _most_ of my Readers, I fancy, regarded this as the
_actual_ conclusion, when that Volume appeared in December, 1889 STOP At any
rate, among all the letters I received about it, there was only _one_
which expressed _any_ suspicion that it was not a _final_ conclusion STOP This letter was from a child STOP She wrote we were so glad, when we came
to the end of the book, to find that there was no ending-up, for that
shows us that you are going to write a sequel STOP It may interest some of my Readers to know the _theory_ on which this
story is constructed STOP It is an attempt to show what might _possibly_
happen, supposing that Fairies really existed; and that they were
sometimes visible to us, and we to them; and that they were sometimes
able to assume human form: and supposing, also, that human beings might
sometimes become conscious of what goes on in the Fairy-worldby actual
transference of their immaterial essence, such as we meet with in
Esoteric Buddhism STOP I have supposed a Human being to be capable of various psychical states,
with varying degrees of consciousness, as follows:

(_a_) the ordinary state, with no consciousness of the presence of
Fairies;

(_b_) the eerie state, in which, while conscious of actual
surroundings, he is _also_ conscious of the presence of Fairies;

(_c_) a form of trance, in which, while _un_conscious of actual
surroundings, and apparently asleep, he (i.e STOP his immaterial essence)
migrates to other scenes, in the actual world, or in Fairyland, and is
conscious of the presence of Fairies STOP I have also supposed a Fairy to be capable of migrating from Fairyland
into the actual world, and of assuming, at pleasure, a Human form; and
also to be capable of various psychical states, viz STOP (_a_) the ordinary state, with no consciousness of the presence of Human
beings;

(_b_) a sort of eerie state, in which he is conscious, if in the
actual world, of the presence of actual Human beings; if in Fairyland,
of the presence of the immaterial essences of Human beings STOP I will here tabulate the passages, in both Volumes, where abnormal
states occur STOP Historians Locality and State STOP Other characters STOP Vol STOP I.

In the Preface to Vol STOP I., at p. x., I gave an account of the
_origination_ of some of the ideas embodied in the book STOP A few more such
details may perhaps interest my Readers:

I. p. 203 STOP The very peculiar use, here made of a dead mouse, comes from
real life STOP I once found two very small boys, in a garden, playing a
microscopic game of Single-Wicket STOP The bat was, I think, about the
size of a table-spoon; and the utmost distance attained by the ball, in
its most daring flights, was some 4 or 5 yards STOP The _exact_ length was
of course a matter of _supreme_ importance; and it was always carefully
measured out (the batsman and the bowler amicably sharing the toil) with
a dead mouse STOP I. p. 259 STOP The two quasi-mathematical Axioms, quoted by Arthur at p. 259
of Vol STOP I., (Things that are greater than the same are greater than one
another, and All angles are equal) were actually enunciated, in all
seriousness, by undergraduates at a University situated not 100 miles
from Ely STOP II STOP p. 10 STOP Brunos remark (I can, if I like, &c.) was actually made by
a little boy STOP II STOP p. 12 STOP So also was his remark (I know what it _doesnt_ spell. STOP And his remark (I just twiddled my eyes, &c.) I heard from the lips of
a little girl, who had just solved a puzzle I had set her STOP II STOP p. 57 STOP Brunos soliloquy (For its father, &c.) was actually spoken
by a little girl, looking out of the window of a railway-carriage STOP II STOP p. 138 STOP The remark, made by a guest at the dinner-party, when asking
for a dish of fruit (Ive been wishing for them, &c.) I heard made by
the great Poet-Laureate, whose loss the whole reading-world has so
lately had to deplore STOP II STOP p. 163 STOP Brunos speech, on the subject of the age of Mein Herr,
embodies the reply of a little girl to the question Is your grandmother
an _old_ lady STOP I dont know if shes an _old_ lady, said this
cautious young person; shes _eighty-three_ STOP II STOP p. 203 STOP The speech about Obstruction is no mere creature of my
imagination STOP It is copied _verbatim_ from the columns of the Standard,
and was spoken by Sir William Harcourt, who was, at the time, a member
of the Opposition, at the National Liberal Club, on July the 16th,
1890 STOP II STOP p. 329 STOP The Professors remark, about a dogs tail, that it doesnt
bite at _that_ end, was actually made by a child, when warned of the
danger he was incurring by pulling the dogs tail STOP II STOP p. 374 STOP The dialogue between Sylvie and Bruno, which occupies lines
6 to 15, is a _verbatim_ report (merely substituting cake for penny)
of a dialogue overheard between two children STOP One story in this VolumeBrunos PicnicI can vouch for as suitable
for telling to children, having tested it again and again; and, whether
my audience has been a dozen little girls in a village-school, or some
thirty or forty in a London drawing-room, or a hundred in a High School,
I have always found them earnestly attentive, and keenly appreciative of
such fun as the story supplied STOP May I take this opportunity of calling attention to what I flatter
myself was a successful piece of name-coining, at p. 42 of Vol STOP I STOP Does
not the name Sibimet fairly embody the character of the Sub-Warden STOP The gentle Reader has no doubt observed what a singularly useless
article in a house a brazen trumpet is, if you simply leave it lying
about, and never blow it STOP Readers of the first Volume, who have amused themselves by trying to
solve the two puzzles propounded at pp STOP xi., xii STOP of the Preface, may
perhaps like to exercise their ingenuity in discovering which (if any)
of the following parallelisms were intentional, and which (if any)
accidental STOP Little Birds STOP Events, and Persons STOP Stanza       1 STOP Banquet STOP 2 STOP Chancellor STOP 3 STOP Empress and Spinach (II STOP 325) STOP 4 STOP Wardens Return STOP 5 STOP Professors Lecture (II STOP 339) STOP 6 STOP Other Professors song (I STOP 138) STOP 7 STOP Petting of Uggug STOP 8 STOP Baron Doppelgeist STOP 9 STOP Jester and Bear (I STOP 119) STOP Little Foxes STOP 10 STOP Brunos Dinner-Bell; Little Foxes STOP I will publish the answer to this puzzle in the Preface to a little book
of Original Games and Puzzles, now in course of preparation STOP I have reserved, for the last, one or two rather more serious topics STOP I had intended, in this Preface, to discuss more fully, than I had done
in the previous Volume, the Morality of Sport, with special reference
to letters I have received from lovers of Sport, in which they point out
the many great advantages which men get from it, and try to prove that
the suffering, which it inflicts on animals, is too trivial to be
regarded STOP But, when I came to think the subject out, and to arrange the whole of
the arguments pro and con, I found it much too large for treatment
here STOP Some day, I hope to publish an essay on this subject STOP At present,
I will content myself with stating the net result I have arrived at STOP It is, that God has given to Man an absolute right to take the _lives_
of other animals, for _any_ reasonable cause, such as the supply of
food: but that He has _not_ given to Man the right to inflict _pain_,
unless when _necessary_: that mere pleasure, or advantage, does not
constitute such a necessity: and, consequently, that pain, inflicted for
the purposes of _Sport_, is cruel, and therefore wrong STOP But I find it a
far more complex question than I had supposed; and that the case, on
the side of the Sportsman, is a much stronger one than I had supposed STOP So, for the present, I say no more about it STOP Objections have been raised to the severe language I have put into the
mouth of Arthur, at p. 277, on the subject of Sermons, and at pp STOP 273, 274, on the subjects of Choral Services and Choristers STOP I have already protested against the assumption that I am ready to
endorse the opinions of characters in my story STOP But, in these two
instances, I admit that I am much in sympathy with Arthur STOP In my
opinion, far too many sermons are expected from our preachers; and, as a
consequence, a great many are preached, which are not worth listening
to; and, as a consequence of _that_, we are very apt _not_ to listen STOP The reader of this paragraph probably heard a sermon last Sunday
morning STOP Well, let him, if he can, name the text, and state how the
preacher treated it STOP Then, as to Choristers, and all the other accessoriesof music,
vestments, processions, &c.,which have come, along with them, into
fashionwhile freely admitting that the Ritual movement was sorely
needed, and that it has effected a vast improvement in our
Church-Services, which had become dead and dry to the last degree, I
hold that, like many other desirable movements, it has gone too far in
the opposite direction, and has introduced many new dangers STOP For the Congregation this new movement involves the danger of learning
to think that the Services are done _for_ them; and that their bodily
_presence_ is all they need contribute STOP And, for Clergy and Congregation
alike, it involves the danger of regarding these elaborate Services as
_ends in themselves_, and of forgetting that they are simply _means_,
and the very hollowest of mockeries, unless they bear fruit in our
_lives_ STOP For the Choristers it seems to involve the danger of self-conceit, as
described at p. 274, the danger of regarding those parts of the Service,
where their help is not required, as not worth attending to, the danger
of coming to regard the Service as a mere outward forma series of
postures to be assumed, and of words to be said or sung, while the
_thoughts_ are elsewhereand the danger of familiarity breeding
contempt for sacred things STOP Let me illustrate these last two forms of danger, from my own
experience STOP Not long ago, I attended a Cathedral-Service, and was placed
immediately behind a row of men, members of the Choir; and I could not
help noticing that they treated the _Lessons_ as a part of the Service
to which they needed not to give _any_ attention, and as affording them
a convenient opportunity for arranging music-books, &c., &c. Also I have
frequently seen a row of little choristers, after marching in procession
to their places, kneel down, as if about to pray, and rise from their
knees after a minute spent in looking about them, it being but too
evident that the attitude was a mere mockery STOP Surely it is very
dangerous, for these children, to thus accustom them to _pretend_ to
pray STOP As an instance of irreverent treatment of holy things, I will
mention a custom, which no doubt many of my readers have noticed in
Churches where the Clergy and Choir enter in procession, viz STOP that, at
the end of the private devotions, which are carried on in the vestry,
and which are of course inaudible to the Congregation, the final Amen
is _shouted_, loud enough to be heard all through the Church STOP This
serves as a signal, to the Congregation, to prepare to rise when the
procession appears: and it admits of no dispute that it is for this
purpose that it is thus shouted STOP When we remember to Whom that Amen is
_really_ addressed, and consider that it is here _used_ for the same
purpose as one of the Church-bells, we must surely admit that it is a
piece of gross irreverence STOP To _me_ it is much as if I were to see a
Bible used as a footstool STOP As an instance of the dangers, for the Clergy themselves, introduced by
this new movement, let me mention the fact that, according to _my_
experience, Clergymen of this school are _specially_ apt to retail comic
anecdotes, in which the most sacred names and wordssometimes actual
texts from the Bibleare used as themes for jesting STOP Many such things
are repeated as having been originally said by _children_, whose utter
ignorance of evil must no doubt acquit _them_, in the sight of God, of
all blame; but it must be otherwise for those who _consciously_ use such
innocent utterances as material for their unholy mirth STOP Let me add, however, _most_ earnestly, that I fully believe that this
profanity is, in many cases, _un_conscious: the environment (as I have
tried to explain at p. 123) makes all the difference between man and
man; and I rejoice to think that many of these profane storieswhich _I_
find so painful to listen to, and should feel it a sin to repeatgive to
_their_ ears no pain, and to _their_ consciences no shock; and that
_they_ can utter, not less sincerely than myself, the two prayers,
_Hallowed be Thy Name_ and _from hardness of heart, and contempt of
Thy Word and Commandment, Good Lord, deliver us!_ To which I would
desire to add, for their sake and for my own, Kebles beautiful
petition, _help us, this and every day, To live more nearly as we
pray!_ It is, in fact, for its _consequences_for the grave dangers,
both to speaker and to hearer, which it involvesrather than for what it
is _in itself_, that I mourn over this clerical habit of profanity in
social talk STOP To the _believing_ hearer it brings the danger of loss of
reverence for holy things, by the mere act of listening to, and
enjoying, such jests; and also the temptation to retail them for the
amusement of others STOP To the _unbelieving_ hearer it brings a welcome
confirmation of his theory that religion is a fable, in the spectacle of
its accredited champions thus betraying their trust STOP And to the speaker
himself it must surely bring the danger of _loss of faith_ STOP For surely
such jests, if uttered with no consciousness of harm, must necessarily
be also uttered with no consciousness, at the moment, of the _reality_
of God, as a _living being_, who hears all we say STOP And he, who allows
himself the habit of thus uttering holy words, with no thought of their
meaning, is but too likely to find that, for him, God has become a myth,
and heaven a poetic fancythat, for him, the light of life is gone, and
that he is at heart an atheist, lost in _a darkness that may be felt_ STOP There is, I fear, at the present time, an increasing tendency to
irreverent treatment of the name of God and of subjects connected with
religion STOP Some of our theatres are helping this downward movement by the
gross caricatures of clergymen which they put upon the stage: some of
our clergy are themselves helping it, by showing that they can lay aside
the spirit of reverence, along with their surplices, and can treat as
jests, when _outside_ their churches, names and things to which they pay
an almost superstitious veneration when _inside_: the Salvation Army
has, I fear, with the best intentions, done much to help it, by the
coarse familiarity with which they treat holy things: and surely every
one, who desires to _live_ in the spirit of the prayer _Hallowed be thy
Name_, ought to do what he can, however little that may be, to check
it STOP So I have gladly taken this unique opportunity, however unfit the
topic may seem for the Preface to a book of this kind, to express some
thoughts which have weighed on my mind for a long time STOP I did not
expect, when I wrote the Preface to Vol STOP I, that it would be read to any
appreciable extent: but I rejoice to believe, from evidence that has
reached me, that it _has_ been read by many, and to hope that this
Preface will also be so: and I think that, among them, some will be
found ready to sympathise with the views I have put forwards, and ready
to help, with their prayers and their example, the revival, in Society,
of the waning spirit of reverence STOP _Christmas_, 1893 STOP CONTENTS STOP CHAPTER                                                            PAGE

                            SYLVIE AND BRUNO
                               CONCLUDED STOP  STOP BRUNOS LESSONS STOP During the next month or two my solitary town-life seemed, by contrast,
unusually dull and tedious STOP I missed the pleasant friends I had left
behind at Elvestonthe genial interchange of thoughtthe sympathy which
gave to ones ideas a new and vivid reality: but, perhaps more than all,
I missed the companionship of the two Fairiesor Dream-Children, for I
had not yet solved the problem as to who or what they werewhose sweet
playfulness had shed a magic radiance over my life STOP In office-hourswhich I suppose reduce most men to the mental condition
of a coffee-mill or a mangletime sped along much as usual: it was in
the pauses of life, the desolate hours when books and newspapers palled
on the sated appetite, and when, thrown back upon ones own dreary
musings, one stroveall in vainto people the vacant air with the dear
faces of absent friends, that the real bitterness of solitude made
itself felt STOP One evening, feeling my life a little more wearisome than usual, I
strolled down to my Club, not so much with the hope of meeting any
friend there, for London was now out of town, as with the feeling that
here, at least, I should hear sweet words of human speech, and come
into contact with human thought STOP However, almost the first face I saw there _was_ that of a friend STOP Eric
Lindon was lounging, with rather a bored expression of face, over a
newspaper; and we fell into conversation with a mutual satisfaction
which neither of us tried to conceal STOP After a while I ventured to introduce what was just then the main
subject of my thoughts STOP And so the Doctor (a name we had adopted by a
tacit agreement, as a convenient compromise between the formality of
Doctor Forester and the intimacyto which Eric Lindon hardly seemed
entitledof Arthur) has gone abroad by this time, I suppose STOP Can you
give me his present address STOP He is still at ElvestonI believe, was the reply STOP But I have not been
there since I last met you STOP I did not know which part of this intelligence to wonder at most STOP And
might I askif it isnt taking too much of a libertywhen your
wedding-bells are toor perhaps they _have_ rung, already STOP No, said Eric, in a steady voice, which betrayed scarcely a trace of
emotion: _that_ engagement is at an end STOP I am still Benedick the
_un_married man STOP After this, the thick-coming fanciesall radiant with new possibilities
of happiness for Arthurwere far too bewildering to admit of any further
conversation, and I was only too glad to avail myself of the first
decent excuse, that offered itself, for retiring into silence STOP The next day I wrote to Arthur, with as much of a reprimand for his long
silence as I could bring myself to put into words, begging him to tell
me how the world went with him STOP Needs must that three or four dayspossibly moreshould elapse before I
could receive his reply; and never had I known days drag their slow
length along with a more tedious indolence STOP To while away the time, I strolled, one afternoon, into Kensington
Gardens, and, wandering aimlessly along any path that presented itself,
I soon became aware that I had somehow strayed into one that was wholly
new to me STOP Still, my elfish experiences seemed to have so completely
faded out of my life that nothing was further from my thoughts than the
idea of again meeting my fairy-friends, when I chanced to notice a small
creature, moving among the grass that fringed the path, that did not
seem to be an insect, or a frog, or any other living thing that I could
think of STOP Cautiously kneeling down, and making an _ex tempore_ cage of
my two hands, I imprisoned the little wanderer, and felt a sudden thrill
of surprise and delight on discovering that my prisoner was no other
than _Bruno_ himself STOP Bruno took the matter _very_ coolly, and, when I had replaced him on the
ground, where he would be within easy conversational distance, he began
talking, just as if it were only a few minutes since last we had met STOP Doos oo know what the _Rule_ is, he enquired, when oo catches a
Fairy, withouten its having tolded oo where it was STOP (Brunos notions of
English Grammar had certainly _not_ improved since our last meeting. STOP No, I said STOP I didnt know there was any Rule about it STOP I _think_ oove got a right to _eat_ me, said the little fellow,
looking up into my face with a winning smile STOP But Im not pruffickly
sure STOP Ood better not do it wizout asking STOP It did indeed seem reasonable not to take so irrevocable a step as
_that_, without due enquiry STOP Ill certainly _ask_ about it, first, I
said STOP Besides, I dont know yet whether you would be _worth_ eating STOP I guess Im _deliciously_ good to eat, Bruno remarked in a satisfied
tone, as if it were something to be rather proud of STOP And what are you doing here, Bruno STOP _Thats_ not my name STOP said my cunning little friend STOP Dont oo know my
names Oh Bruno! STOP Thats what Sylvie always calls me, when I says mine
lessons STOP Well then, what are you doing here, oh Bruno STOP Doing mine lessons, a-course STOP With that roguish twinkle in his eye,
that always came when he knew he was talking nonsense STOP Oh, _thats_ the way you do your lessons, is it STOP And do you remember
them well STOP Always can member _mine_ lessons, said Bruno STOP Its _Sylvies_
lessons thats so _dreffully_ hard to member STOP He frowned, as if in
agonies of thought, and tapped his forehead with his knuckles STOP I
_cant_ think enough to understand them STOP he said despairingly STOP It
wants _double_ thinking, I believe STOP But wheres Sylvie gone STOP Thats just what _I_ want to know STOP said Bruno disconsolately STOP What
evers the good of setting me lessons, when she isnt here to splain
the hard bits STOP _Ill_ find her for you STOP I volunteered; and, getting up, I wandered
round the tree under whose shade I had been reclining, looking on all
sides for Sylvie STOP In another minute I _again_ noticed some strange thing
moving among the grass, and, kneeling down, was immediately confronted
with Sylvies innocent face, lighted up with a joyful surprise at seeing
me, and was accosted, in the sweet voice I knew so well, with what
seemed to be the _end_ of a sentence whose beginning I had failed to
catch STOP and I think he ought to have _finished_ them by this time STOP So Im
going back to him STOP Will you come too STOP Its only just round at the other
side of this tree STOP It was but a few steps for _me_; but it was a great many for Sylvie; and
I had to be very careful to walk slowly, in order not to leave the
little creature so far behind as to lose sight of her STOP To find Brunos _lessons_ was easy enough: they appeared to be neatly
written out on large smooth ivy-leaves, which were scattered in some
confusion over a little patch of ground where the grass had been worn
away; but the pale student, who ought by rights to have been bending
over them, was nowhere to be seen: we looked in all directions, for some
time, in vain; but at last Sylvies sharp eyes detected him, swinging on
a tendril of ivy, and Sylvies stern voice commanded his instant return
to _terra firma_ and to the business of Life STOP [Illustration: SYLVIES TRUANT-PUPIL]

Pleasure first and business afterwards seemed to be the motto of these
tiny folk, so many hugs and kisses had to be interchanged before
anything else could be done STOP Now, Bruno, Sylvie said reproachfully, didnt I tell you you were to
go on with your lessons, unless you heard to the contrary STOP But I _did_ heard to the contrary STOP Bruno insisted, with a mischievous
twinkle in his eye STOP _What_ did you hear, you wicked boy STOP It were a sort of noise in the air, said Bruno: a sort of a
scrambling noise STOP Didnt _oo_ hear it, Mister Sir STOP Well, anyhow, you neednt go to _sleep_ over them, you lazy-lazy STOP For
Bruno had curled himself up, on the largest lesson, and was arranging
another as a pillow STOP I _wasnt_ asleep STOP said Bruno, in a deeply-injured tone STOP When I shuts
mine eyes, its to show that Im _awake_ STOP Well, how much have you learned, then STOP Ive learned a little tiny bit, said Bruno, modestly, being evidently
afraid of overstating his achievement STOP _Cant_ learn no more STOP Oh Bruno STOP You know you _can_, if you like STOP Course I can, if I _like_, the pale student replied; but I cant if
I _dont_ like STOP Sylvie had a waywhich I could not too highly admireof evading Brunos
logical perplexities by suddenly striking into a new line of thought;
and this masterly stratagem she now adopted STOP Well, I must say _one_ thing

Did oo know, Mister Sir, Bruno thoughtfully remarked, that Sylvie
cant count STOP Whenever she says I must say _one_ thing, I _know_ quite
well shell say _two_ things STOP And she always doos STOP Two heads are better than one, Bruno, I said, but with no very
distinct idea as to what I meant by it STOP I shouldnt mind having two _heads_, Bruno said softly to himself:
one head to eat mine dinner, and one head to argue wiz Sylviedoos oo
think ood look prettier if ood got _two_ heads, Mister Sir STOP The case did not, I assured him, admit of a doubt STOP The reason why Sylvies so cross Bruno went on very seriously,
almost sadly STOP Sylvies eyes grew large and round with surprise at this new line of
enquiryher rosy face being perfectly radiant with good humour STOP But she
said nothing STOP Wouldnt it be better to tell me after the lessons are over STOP I
suggested STOP Very well, Bruno said with a resigned air: only she wont be cross
then STOP Theres only three lessons to do, said Sylvie STOP Spelling, and
Geography, and Singing STOP Not _Arithmetic_ STOP I said STOP No, he hasnt a head for Arithmetic

Course I havent STOP said Bruno STOP Mine heads for _hair_ STOP I havent got a
_lot_ of heads STOP and he cant learn his Multiplication-table

I like _History_ ever so much better, Bruno remarked STOP Oo has to
_repeat_ that Muddlecome table

Well, and you have to repeat

No, oo hasnt STOP Bruno interrupted STOP History repeats itself STOP The
Professor said so STOP Sylvie was arranging some letters on a boardEVIL STOP Now, Bruno, she
said, what does _that_ spell STOP Bruno looked at it, in solemn silence, for a minute STOP I knows what it
_doosnt_ spell STOP he said at last STOP Thats no good, said Sylvie STOP What _does_ it spell STOP Bruno took another look at the mysterious letters STOP Why, its LIVE,
backwards STOP he exclaimed STOP (I thought it was, indeed. STOP How _did_ you manage to see that STOP said Sylvie STOP I just twiddled my eyes, said Bruno, and then I saw it directly STOP Now
may I sing the King-fisher Song STOP Geography next, said Sylvie STOP Dont you know the Rules STOP I thinks there oughtnt to be such a lot of Rules, Sylvie STOP I thinks

Yes, there _ought_ to be such a lot of Rules, you wicked, wicked boy STOP And how dare you _think_ at all about it STOP And shut up that mouth
directly STOP So, as that mouth didnt seem inclined to shut up of itself, Sylvie
shut it for himwith both handsand sealed it with a kiss, just as you
would fasten up a letter STOP Now that Bruno is fastened up from talking, she went on, turning to
me, Ill show you the Map he does his lessons on STOP And there it was, a large Map of the World, spread out on the ground STOP It
was so large that Bruno had to crawl about on it, to point out the
places named in the King-fisher Lesson STOP When a King-fisher sees a Lady-bird flying away, he says _Ceylon_, if
you _Candia_ STOP And when he catches it, he says Come to _Media_ STOP And if
youre _Hungary_ or thirsty, Ill give you some _Nubia_ STOP When he takes
it in his claws, he says _Europe!_ When he puts it into his beak, he
says _India!_ When hes swallowed it, he says _Eton!_ Thats all STOP Thats _quite_ perfect, said Sylvie STOP Now you may sing the King-fisher
Song STOP Will _oo_ sing the chorus STOP Bruno said to me STOP I was just beginning to say Im afraid I dont know the _words_, when
Sylvie silently turned the map over, and I found the words were all
written on the back STOP In one respect it was a _very_ peculiar song: the
chorus to each verse came in the _middle_, instead of at the _end_ of
it STOP However, the tune was so easy that I soon picked it up, and managed
the chorus as well, perhaps, as it is possible for _one_ person to
manage such a thing STOP It was in vain that I signed to Sylvie to help me:
she only smiled sweetly and shook her head STOP King Fisher courted Lady Bird
  _Sing Beans, sing Bones, sing Butterflies!_
    Find me my match, he said,
    With such a noble head
  With such a beard, as white as curd
    With such expressive eyes STOP Yet pins have heads, said Lady Bird
  _Sing Prunes, sing Prawns, sing Primrose-Hill!_
    And, where you stick them in,
    They stay, and thus a pin
  Is very much to be preferred
    To one thats never still STOP Oysters have beards, said Lady Bird
  _Sing Flies, sing Frogs, sing Fiddle-strings!_
    I love them, for I know
    _They_ never chatter so:
  They would not say one single word
    Not if you crowned them Kings STOP Needles have eyes, said Lady Bird
  _Sing Cats, sing Corks, sing Cowslip-tea!_
      And they are sharpjust what
      Your Majesty is _not:_
  So get you gonetis too absurd
      To come a-courting _me_ STOP [Illustration: KING FISHERS WOOING]

So he went away, Bruno added as a kind of postscript, when the last
note of the song had died away STOP Just like he always did STOP Oh, my _dear_ Bruno STOP Sylvie exclaimed, with her hands over her ears STOP You shouldnt say like: you should say _what_ STOP To which Bruno replied, doggedly, I only says what STOP when oo doosnt
speak loud, so as I can hear oo STOP Where did he go to STOP I asked, hoping to prevent an argument STOP He went more far than hed never been before, said Bruno STOP You should never say more far, Sylvie corrected him: you should say
_farther_ STOP Then _oo_ shouldnt say more broth, when were at dinner, Bruno
retorted: oo should say _brother_ STOP This time Sylvie evaded an argument by turning away, and beginning to
roll up the Map STOP Lessons are over STOP she proclaimed in her sweetest
tones STOP And has there been no _crying_ over them STOP I enquired STOP Little boys
_always_ cry over their lessons, dont they STOP I never cries after twelve oclock, said Bruno: cause then its
getting so near to dinner-time STOP Sometimes, in the morning, Sylvie said in a low voice; when its
Geography-day, and when hes been disobe

_What_ a fellow you are to talk, Sylvie STOP Bruno hastily interposed STOP Doos oo think the world was _made_ for oo to talk in STOP Why, where would you _have_ me talk, then STOP Sylvie said, evidently
quite ready for an argument STOP But Bruno answered resolutely STOP Im not going to argue about it, cause
its getting late, and there wont be timebut oos as ong as ever oo
can be STOP And he rubbed the back of his hand across his eyes, in which
tears were beginning to glitter STOP _Sylvies_ eyes filled with tears in a moment STOP I didnt mean it, Bruno,
_darling_ STOP she whispered; and the rest of the argument was lost amid
the tangles of Neras hair, while the two disputants hugged and kissed
each other STOP But this new form of argument was brought to a sudden end by a flash of
lightning, which was closely followed by a peal of thunder, and by a
torrent of rain-drops, which came hissing and spitting, almost like live
creatures, through the leaves of the tree that sheltered us STOP Why, its raining cats and dogs STOP I said STOP And all the _dogs_ has come down _first_, said Bruno: theres nothing
but _cats_ coming down now STOP In another minute the pattering ceased, as suddenly as it had begun STOP I
stepped out from under the tree, and found that the storm was over; but
I looked in vain, on my return, for my tiny companions STOP They had
vanished with the storm, and there was nothing for it but to make the
best of my way home STOP On the table lay, awaiting my return, an envelope of that peculiar
yellow tint which always announces a telegram, and which must be, in the
memories of so many of us, inseparably linked with some great and sudden
sorrowsomething that has cast a shadow, never in this world to be
wholly lifted off, on the brightness of Life STOP No doubt it has _also_
heraldedfor many of ussome sudden news of joy; but this, I think, is
less common: human life seems, on the whole, to contain more of sorrow
than of joy STOP And yet the world goes on STOP Who knows why STOP This time, however, there was no shock of sorrow to be faced: in fact,
the few words it contained (Could not bring myself to write STOP Come soon STOP Always welcome STOP A letter follows this STOP Arthur. STOP seemed so like Arthur
himself speaking, that it gave me quite a thrill of pleasure, and I at
once began the preparations needed for the journey STOP  STOP LOVES CURFEW STOP Fayfield Junction STOP Change for Elveston STOP What subtle memory could there be, linked to these commonplace words,
that caused such a flood of happy thoughts to fill my brain STOP I
dismounted from the carriage in a state of joyful excitement for which I
could not at first account STOP True, I had taken this very journey, and at
the same hour of the day, six months ago; but many things had happened
since then, and an old mans memory has but a slender hold on recent
events: I sought the missing link in vain STOP Suddenly I caught sight of
a benchthe only one provided on the cheerless platformwith a lady
seated on it, and the whole forgotten scene flashed upon me as vividly
as if it were happening over again STOP Yes, I thought STOP This bare platform is, for me, rich with the memory
of a dear friend STOP She was sitting on that very bench, and invited me to
share it, with some quotation from ShakespeareI forget what STOP Ill try
the Earls plan for the Dramatisation of Life, and fancy that figure to
be Lady Muriel; and I wont undeceive myself too soon STOP So I strolled along the platform, resolutely making-believe (as
children say) that the casual passenger, seated on that bench, was the
Lady Muriel I remembered so well STOP She was facing away from me, which
aided the elaborate cheatery I was practising on myself: but, though I
was careful, in passing the spot, to look the other way, in order to
prolong the pleasant illusion, it was inevitable that, when I turned to
walk back again, I should see who it was STOP It was Lady Muriel herself STOP [Illustration: SPEND IT ALL FOR MINNIE]

The whole scene now returned vividly to my memory; and, to make this
repetition of it stranger still, there was the same old man, whom I
remembered seeing so roughly ordered off, by the Station-Master, to make
room for his titled passenger STOP The same, but with a difference: no
longer tottering feebly along the platform, but actually seated at Lady
Muriels side, and in conversation with her STOP Yes, put it in your
purse, she was saying, and remember youre to spend it all for
_Minnie_ STOP And mind you bring her something nice, thatll do her real
good STOP And give her my love STOP So intent was she on saying these words,
that, although the sound of my footstep had made her lift her head and
look at me, she did not at first recognise me STOP I raised my hat as I approached, and then there flashed across her face
a genuine look of joy, which so exactly recalled the sweet face of
Sylvie, when last we met in Kensington Gardens, that I felt quite
bewildered STOP Rather than disturb the poor old man at her side, she rose from her
seat, and joined me in my walk up and down the platform, and for a
minute or two our conversation was as utterly trivial and commonplace as
if we were merely two casual guests in a London drawing-room STOP Each of us
seemed to shrink, just at first, from touching on the deeper interests
which linked our lives together STOP The Elveston train had drawn up at the platform, while we talked; and,
in obedience to the Station-Masters obsequious hint of This way, my
Lady STOP Times up!, we were making the best of our way towards the end
which contained the sole first-class carriage, and were just passing the
now-empty bench, when Lady Muriel noticed, lying on it, the purse in
which her gift had just been so carefully bestowed, the owner of which,
all unconscious of his loss, was being helped into a carriage at the
other end of the train STOP She pounced on it instantly STOP Poor old man STOP she
cried STOP He mustnt go off, and think hes lost it STOP Let _me_ run with it STOP I can go quicker than you STOP I said STOP But she was
already half-way down the platform, flying (running is much too
mundane a word for such fairy-like motion) at a pace that left all
possible efforts of _mine_ hopelessly in the rear STOP She was back again before I had well completed my audacious boast of
speed in running, and was saying, quite demurely, as we entered our
carriage, and you really think _you_ could have done it quicker STOP No indeed STOP I replied STOP I plead Guilty of gross exaggeration, and
throw myself on the mercy of the Court STOP The Court will overlook itfor this once STOP Then her manner suddenly
changed from playfulness to an anxious gravity STOP You are not looking your best STOP she said with an anxious glance STOP In
fact, I think you look _more_ of an invalid than when you left us STOP I
very much doubt if London agrees with you STOP It _may_ be the London air, I said, or it may be the hard workor my
rather lonely life: anyhow, Ive _not_ been feeling very well, lately STOP But Elveston will soon set me up again STOP Arthurs prescriptionhes my
doctor, you know, and I heard from him this morningis plenty of ozone,
and new milk, and _pleasant society_ STOP Pleasant society STOP said Lady Muriel, with a pretty make-believe of
considering the question STOP Well, really I dont know where we can find
_that_ for you STOP We have so few neighbours STOP But new milk we _can_ manage STOP Do get it of my old friend Mrs. Hunter, up there, on the hill-side STOP You
may rely upon the _quality_ STOP And her little Bessie comes to school every
day, and passes your lodgings STOP So it would be very easy to send it STOP Ill follow your advice, with pleasure, I said; and Ill go and
arrange about it tomorrow STOP I know Arthur will want a walk STOP Youll find it quite an easy walkunder three miles, I think STOP Well, now that weve settled that point, let me retort your own remark
upon yourself STOP I dont think _youre_ looking quite your best STOP I daresay not, she replied in a low voice; and a sudden shadow seemed
to overspread her face STOP Ive had some troubles lately STOP Its a matter
about which Ive been long wishing to consult you, but I couldnt easily
write about it STOP Im _so_ glad to have this opportunity STOP Do you think, she began again, after a minutes silence, and with a
visible embarrassment of manner most unusual in her, that a promise,
deliberately and solemnly given, is _always_ bindingexcept, of course,
where its fulfilment would involve some actual _sin_ STOP I cant think of any other exception at this moment, I said STOP That
branch of casuistry is usually, I believe, treated as a question of
truth and untruth

Surely that _is_ the principle STOP she eagerly interrupted STOP I always
thought the Bible-teaching about it consisted of such texts as _lie not
one to another_ STOP I have thought about that point, I replied; and it seems to me that
the essence of _lying_ is the intention of _deceiving_ STOP If you give a
promise, fully _intending_ to fulfil it, you are certainly acting
truthfully _then_; and, if you afterwards break it, that does not
involve any _deception_ STOP I cannot call it _untruthful_ STOP Another pause of silence ensued STOP Lady Muriels face was hard to read:
she looked pleased, I thought, but also puzzled; and I felt curious to
know whether her question had, as I began to suspect, some bearing on
the breaking off of her engagement with Captain (now Major) Lindon STOP You have relieved me from a great fear, she said; but the thing is of
course _wrong_, somehow STOP What texts would _you_ quote, to prove it
wrong STOP Any that enforce the payment of _debts_ STOP If _A_ promises something to
_B_, _B_ has a claim upon _A_ STOP And _A_s sin, if he breaks his promise,
seems to me more analogous to _stealing_ than to _lying_ STOP Its a new way of looking at itto me, she said; but it seems a
_true_ way, also STOP However, I wont deal in generalities, with an old
friend like you STOP For we _are_ old friends, somehow STOP Do you know, I think
we _began_ as old friends STOP she said with a playfulness of tone that ill
accorded with the tears that glistened in her eyes STOP Thank you very much for saying so, I replied STOP I like to think of you
as an _old_ friend, (though you dont look it STOP would have been the
almost necessary sequence, with any other lady; but she and I seemed to
have long passed out of the time when compliments, or any such
trivialities, were possible. STOP Here the train paused at a station, where two or three passengers
entered the carriage; so no more was said till we had reached our
journeys end STOP On our arrival at Elveston, she readily adopted my suggestion that we
should walk up together; so, as soon as our luggage had been duly taken
charge ofhers by the servant who met her at the station, and mine by
one of the porterswe set out together along the familiar lanes, now
linked in my memory with so many delightful associations STOP Lady Muriel at
once recommenced the conversation at the point where it had been
interrupted STOP You knew of my engagement to my cousin Eric STOP Did you also hear

Yes, I interrupted, anxious to spare her the pain of giving any
details STOP I heard it had all come to an end STOP I would like to tell you how it happened, she said; as that is the
very point I want your advice about STOP I had long realised that we were
not in sympathy in religious belief STOP His ideas of Christianity are very
shadowy; and even as to the existence of a God he lives in a sort of
dreamland STOP But it has not affected his life STOP I feel sure, now, that the
most absolute Atheist _may_ be leading, though walking blindfold, a pure
and noble life STOP And if you knew half the good deeds she broke off
suddenly, and turned away her head STOP I entirely agree with you, I said STOP And have we not our Saviours own
promise that such a life shall surely lead to the light STOP Yes, I know it, she said in a broken voice, still keeping her head
turned away STOP And so I told him STOP He said he would believe, for _my_
sake, if he could STOP And he wished, for _my_ sake, he could see things as
I did STOP But that is all wrong STOP she went on passionately STOP God _cannot_
approve such low motives as that STOP Still it was not _I_ that broke it
off STOP I knew he loved me; and I had _promised_; and

Then it was _he_ that broke it off STOP He released me unconditionally STOP She faced me again now, having quite
recovered her usual calmness of manner STOP Then what difficulty remains STOP It is _this_, that I dont believe he did it of his own free will STOP Now,
supposing he did it _against_ his will, merely to satisfy my scruples,
would not his claim on me remain just as strong as ever STOP And would not
my promise be as binding as ever STOP My father says no; but I cant help
fearing he is biased by his love for me STOP And Ive asked no one else STOP I
have many friendsfriends for the bright sunny weather; not friends for
the clouds and storms of life; not _old_ friends like you STOP Let me think a little, I said: and for some minutes we walked on in
silence, while, pained to the heart at seeing the bitter trial that had
come upon this pure and gentle soul, I strove in vain to see my way
through the tangled skein of conflicting motives STOP If she loves him truly, (I seemed at last to grasp the clue to the
problem) is not _that_, for her, the voice of God STOP May she not hope
that she is sent to him, even as Ananias was sent to Saul in his
blindness, that he may receive his sight STOP Once more I seemed to hear
Arthur whispering _What knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save
thy husband?_ and I broke the silence with the words If you still love
him truly

I do _not_ STOP she hastily interrupted STOP At leastnot in _that_ way STOP I
_believe_ I loved him when I promised; but I was very young: it is hard
to know STOP But, whatever the feeling was, it is dead _now_ STOP The motive on
_his_ side is Love: on _mine_ it isDuty STOP Again there was a long silence STOP The whole skein of thought was tangled
worse than ever STOP This time _she_ broke the silence STOP Dont misunderstand
me STOP she said STOP When I said my heart was not _his_, I did not mean it
was any one elses STOP At present I feel bound to _him_; and, till I know I
am absolutely free, in the sight of God, to love any other than him,
Ill never even _think_ of any one elsein _that_ way, I mean STOP I would
die sooner STOP I had never imagined my gentle friend capable of such
passionate utterances STOP I ventured on no further remark until we had nearly arrived at the
Hall-gate; but, the longer I reflected, the clearer it became to me that
no call of Duty demanded the sacrificepossibly of the happiness of a
lifewhich she seemed ready to make STOP I tried to make this clear to _her_
also, adding some warnings on the dangers that surely awaited a union in
which mutual love was wanting STOP The only argument for it, worth
considering, I said in conclusion, seems to be his supposed
_reluctance_ in releasing you from your promise STOP I have tried to give to
that argument its _full_ weight, and my conclusion is that it does _not_
affect the rights of the case, or invalidate the release he has given
you STOP My belief is that you are _entirely_ free to act as _now_ seems
right STOP I am _very_ grateful to you, she said earnestly STOP Believe it, please STOP I cant put it into proper words STOP and the subject was dropped by
mutual consent: and I only learned, long afterwards, that our discussion
had really served to dispel the doubts that had harassed her so long STOP We parted at the Hall-gate, and I found Arthur eagerly awaiting my
arrival; and, before we parted for the night, I had heard the whole
storyhow he had put off his journey from day to day, feeling that he
_could_ not go away from the place till his fate had been irrevocably
settled by the wedding taking place: how the preparations for the
wedding, and the excitement in the neighbourhood, had suddenly come to
an end, and he had learned (from Major Lindon, who called to wish him
good-bye) that the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent: how
he had instantly abandoned all his plans for going abroad, and had
decided to stay on at Elveston, for a year or two at any rate, till his
newly-awakened hopes should prove true or false; and how, since that
memorable day, he had avoided all meetings with Lady Muriel, fearing to
betray his feelings before he had had any sufficient evidence as to how
she regarded him STOP But it is nearly six weeks since all that happened,
he said in conclusion, and we can meet in the ordinary way, now, with
no need for any painful allusions STOP I would have written to tell you all
this: only I kept hoping from day to day, thatthat there would be
_more_ to tell STOP And how should there be _more_, you foolish fellow, I fondly urged,
if you never even go near her STOP Do you expect the offer to come from
_her_ STOP Arthur was betrayed into a smile STOP No, he said, I hardly expect
_that_ STOP But Im a desperate coward STOP Theres no doubt about it STOP And what _reasons_ have you heard of for breaking off the engagement STOP A good many, Arthur replied, and proceeded to count them on his
fingers STOP First, it was found that she was dying ofsomething; so _he_
broke it off STOP Then it was found that _he_ was dying ofsome other thing;
so _she_ broke it off STOP Then the Major turned out to be a confirmed
gamester; so the _Earl_ broke it off STOP Then the Earl insulted him; so the
_Major_ broke it off STOP It got a good deal broken off, all things
considered STOP You have all this on the very best authority, of course STOP Oh, certainly STOP And communicated in the strictest confidence STOP Whatever
defects Elveston society suffers from, _want of information_ isnt one
of them STOP Nor _reticence_, either, it seems STOP But, seriously, do you know the real
reason STOP No, Im quite in the dark STOP I did not feel that I had any right to enlighten him; so I changed the
subject, to the less engrossing one of new milk, and we agreed that I
should walk over, next day, to Hunters farm, Arthur undertaking to set
me part of the way, after which he had to return to keep a
business-engagement STOP  STOP STREAKS OF DAWN STOP Next day proved warm and sunny, and we started early, to enjoy the
luxury of a good long chat before he would be obliged to leave me STOP This neighbourhood has more than its due proportion of the _very_
poor, I remarked, as we passed a group of hovels, too dilapidated to
deserve the name of cottages STOP But the few rich, Arthur replied, give more than their due proportion
of help in charity STOP So the balance is kept STOP I suppose the _Earl_ does a good deal STOP He _gives_ liberally; but he has not the health or strength to do more STOP Lady Muriel does more in the way of school-teaching and cottage-visiting
than she would like me to reveal STOP Then _she_, at least, is not one of the idle mouths one so often
meets with among the upper classes STOP I have sometimes thought they would
have a hard time of it, if suddenly called on to give their _raison
detre_, and to show cause why they should be allowed to live any
longer STOP The whole subject, said Arthur, of what we may call idle mouths (I
mean persons who absorb some of the material _wealth_ of a communityin
the form of food, clothes, and so onwithout contributing its equivalent
in the form of productive _labour_) is a complicated one, no doubt STOP Ive
tried to think it out STOP And it seemed to me that the simplest form of the
problem, to start with, is a community without _money_, who buy and sell
by _barter_ only; and it makes it yet simpler to suppose the food and
other things to be capable of _keeping_ for many years without
spoiling STOP Yours is an excellent plan, I said STOP What is your solution of the
problem STOP The commonest type of idle mouths, said Arthur, is no doubt due to
money being left by parents to their own children STOP So I imagined a
maneither exceptionally clever, or exceptionally strong and
industriouswho had contributed so much valuable labour to the needs of
the community that its equivalent, in clothes, &c., was (say) five times
as much as he needed for himself STOP We cannot deny his _absolute_ right to
give the superfluous wealth as he chooses STOP So, if he leaves _four_
children behind him (say two sons and two daughters), with enough of all
the necessaries of life to last them a life-time, I cannot see that the
_community_ is in any way wronged if they choose to do nothing in life
but to eat, drink, and be merry STOP Most certainly, the community could
not fairly say, in reference to _them_, _if a man will not work,
neither let him eat_ STOP Their reply would be crushing STOP The labour has
already been _done_, which is a fair equivalent for the food we are
eating; and you have had the benefit of it STOP On what principle of justice
can you demand _two_ quotas of work for _one_ quota of food STOP Yet surely, I said, there is something wrong _somewhere_, if these
four people are well able to do useful work, and if that work is
actually _needed_ by the community, and they elect to sit idle STOP I think there _is_, said Arthur: but it seems to me to arise from a
Law of Godthat every one shall do as much as he can to help othersand
not from any _rights_, on the part of the community, to exact labour as
an equivalent for food that has already been fairly earned STOP I suppose the _second_ form of the problem is where the idle mouths
possess _money_ instead of _material_ wealth STOP Yes, replied Arthur: and I think the simplest case is that of
_paper_-money STOP _Gold_ is itself a form of material wealth; but a
bank-note is merely a _promise_ to hand over so much _material_ wealth
when called upon to do so STOP The father of these four idle mouths, had
done (let us say) five thousand pounds worth of useful work for the
community STOP In return for this, the community had given him what amounted
to a written promise to hand over, whenever called upon to do so, five
thousand pounds worth of food, &c. Then, if he only uses _one_ thousand
pounds worth himself, and leaves the rest of the notes to his children,
surely they have a full right to _present_ these written promises, and
to say hand over the food, for which the equivalent labour has been
already done STOP Now I think _this_ case well worth stating, publicly and
clearly STOP I should like to drive it into the heads of those Socialists
who are priming our ignorant paupers with such sentiments as Look at
them bloated haristocrats STOP Doing not a stroke o work for theirselves,
and living on the sweat of _our_ brows STOP I should like to _force_ them
to see that the _money_, which those haristocrats are spending,
represents so much labour _already done_ for the community, and whose
equivalent, in _material_ wealth, is _due from the community_ STOP Might not the Socialists reply Much of this money does not represent
_honest_ labour _at all_ STOP If you could trace it back, from owner to
owner, though you might begin with several legitimate steps, such as
gift, or bequeathing by will, or value received, you would soon reach
an owner who had no moral right to it, but had got it by fraud or other
crimes; and of course his successors in the line would have no better
right to it than _he_ had STOP No doubt, no doubt, Arthur replied STOP But surely that involves the
logical fallacy of _proving too much_ STOP It is _quite_ as applicable to
_material_ wealth, as it is to _money_ STOP If we once begin to go back
beyond the fact that the _present_ owner of certain property came by it
honestly, and to ask whether any previous owner, in past ages, got it by
fraud, would _any_ property be secure STOP After a minutes thought, I felt obliged to admit the truth of this STOP My general conclusion, Arthur continued, from the mere standpoint of
human _rights_, man against man, was thisthat if some wealthy idle
mouth, who has come by his money in a lawful way, even though not one
atom of the labour it represents has been his own doing, chooses to
spend it on his own needs, without contributing any labour to the
community from whom he buys his food and clothes, that community has no
_right_ to interfere with him STOP But its quite another thing, when we
come to consider the _divine_ law STOP Measured by _that_ standard, such a
man is undoubtedly doing wrong, if he fails to use, for the good of
those in need, the strength or the skill, that God has given him STOP That
strength and skill do _not_ belong to the community, to be paid to
_them_ as a _debt_: they do _not_ belong to the man _himself_, to be
used for his _own_ enjoyment: they _do_ belong to God, to be used
according to _His_ will; and we are not left in doubt as to what that
will is STOP _Do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again._

Anyhow, I said, an idle mouth very often gives away a great deal in
charity STOP In _so-called_ charity, he corrected me STOP Excuse me if I seem to
speak _un_charitably STOP I would not dream of _applying_ the term to any
_individual_ STOP But I would say, _generally_, that a man who gratifies
every fancy that occurs to himdenying himself in _nothing_and merely
gives to the poor some part, or even _all_, of his _superfluous_ wealth,
is only deceiving himself if he calls it _charity_ STOP But, even in giving away _superfluous_ wealth, he _may_ be denying
himself the misers pleasure in hoarding STOP I grant you that, gladly, said Arthur STOP Given that he _has_ that
morbid craving, he is doing a good deed in restraining it STOP But, even in spending on _himself_, I persisted, our typical rich man
often does good, by employing people who would otherwise be out of work:
and that is often better than pauperising them by _giving_ the money STOP Im glad youve said that STOP said Arthur STOP I would not like to quit the
subject without exposing the _two_ fallacies of that statementwhich
have gone so long uncontradicted that Society now accepts it as an
axiom STOP What are they STOP I said STOP I dont even see _one_, myself STOP One is merely the fallacy of _ambiguity_the assumption that _doing
good_ (that is, benefiting somebody) is necessarily _a good thing to
do_ (that is, a _right_ thing) STOP The other is the assumption that, if one
of two specified acts is _better_ than another, it is necessarily a
_good_ act in itself STOP I should like to call this the fallacy of
_comparison_meaning that it assumes that what is _comparatively_ good
is therefore _positively_ good STOP Then what is _your_ test of a good act STOP That it shall be _our best_, Arthur confidently replied STOP And even
_then_ _we are unprofitable servants_ STOP But let me illustrate the two
fallacies STOP Nothing illustrates a fallacy so well as an extreme case,
which fairly comes under it STOP Suppose I find two children drowning in a
pond STOP I rush in, and save one of the children, and then walk away,
leaving the other to drown STOP Clearly I have _done good_, in saving a
childs life STOP But STOP Again, supposing I meet an inoffensive stranger,
and knock him down, and walk on STOP Clearly that is _better_ than if I
had proceeded to jump upon him and break his ribs STOP But

Those buts are quite unanswerable, I said STOP But I should like an
instance from _real_ life STOP Well, let us take one of those abominations of modern Society, a
Charity-Bazaar STOP Its an interesting question to think outhow much of
the money, that reaches the object in view, is _genuine_ charity; and
whether even _that_ is spent in the _best_ way STOP But the subject needs
regular classification, and analysis, to understand it properly STOP I should be glad to _have_ it analysed, I said: it has often puzzled
me STOP Well, if I am really not boring you STOP Let us suppose our Charity-Bazaar
to have been organised to aid the funds of some Hospital: and that A, B,
C _give_ their services in making articles to sell, and in acting as
salesmen, while X, Y, Z buy the articles, and the money so paid goes to
the Hospital STOP There are two distinct species of such Bazaars: one, where the payment
exacted is merely the _market-value_ of the goods supplied, that is,
exactly what you would have to pay at a shop: the other, where
_fancy-prices_ are asked STOP We must take these separately STOP First, the market-value case STOP Here A, B, C are exactly in the same
position as ordinary shopkeepers; the only difference being that they
give the proceeds to the Hospital STOP Practically, they are _giving their
skilled labour_ for the benefit of the Hospital STOP This seems to me to be
genuine charity STOP And I dont see how they could use it better STOP But X, Y,
Z, are exactly in the same position as any ordinary purchasers of goods STOP To talk of charity in connection with _their_ share of the business,
is sheer nonsense STOP Yet they are very likely to do so STOP Secondly, the case of fancy-prices STOP Here I think the simplest plan is
to divide the payment into two parts, the market-value and the excess
over that STOP The market-value part is on the same footing as in the
first case: the _excess_ is all we have to consider STOP Well, A, B, C do
not _earn_ it; so we may put _them_ out of the question: it is a _gift_,
from X, Y, Z, to the Hospital STOP And my opinion is that it is not given in
the best way: far better buy what they choose to _buy_, and give what
they choose to _give_, as two _separate_ transactions: then there is
_some_ chance that their motive in giving may be real charity, instead
of a mixed motivehalf charity, half self-pleasing STOP The trail of the
serpent is over it all STOP And _therefore_ it is that I hold all such
spurious Charities in _utter_ abomination STOP He ended with unusual
energy, and savagely beheaded, with his stick, a tall thistle at the
road-side, behind which I was startled to see Sylvie and Bruno standing STOP I caught at his arm, but too late to stop him STOP Whether the stick reached
them, or not, I could not feel sure: at any rate they took not the
smallest notice of it, but smiled gaily, and nodded to me; and I saw at
once that they were only visible to _me_: the eerie influence had not
reached to _Arthur_ STOP Why did you try to save it STOP he said STOP _Thats_ not the wheedling
Secretary of a Charity-Bazaar STOP I only wish it were STOP he added grimly STOP Doos oo know, that stick went right froo my head STOP said Bruno STOP (They
had run round to me by this time, and each had secured a hand. STOP Just
under my chin STOP I _are_ glad I arent a thistle STOP Well, weve threshed _that_ subject out, anyhow STOP Arthur resumed STOP Im
afraid Ive been talking too much, for _your_ patience and for my
strength STOP I must be turning soon STOP This is about the end of my tether STOP Take, O boatman, thrice thy fee;
  Take, I give it willingly;
  For, invisible to thee,
  Spirits twain have crossed with me STOP I quoted, involuntarily STOP For utterly inappropriate and irrelevant quotations, laughed Arthur,
you are ekalled by few, and excelled by none STOP And we strolled on STOP As we passed the head of the lane that led down to the beach, I noticed
a single figure, moving slowly along it, seawards STOP She was a good way
off, and had her back to us: but it was Lady Muriel, unmistakably STOP Knowing that Arthur had not seen her, as he had been looking, in the
other direction, at a gathering rain-cloud, I made no remark, but tried
to think of some plausible pretext for sending him back by the sea STOP The opportunity instantly presented itself STOP Im getting tired, he
said STOP I dont think it would be prudent to go further STOP I had better
turn here STOP I turned with him, for a few steps, and as we again approached the head
of the lane, I said, as carelessly as I could, Dont go back by the
road STOP Its too hot and dusty STOP Down this lane, and along the beach, is
nearly as short; and youll get a breeze off the sea STOP Yes, I think I will, Arthur began; but at that moment we came into
sight of Lady Muriel, and he checked himself STOP No, its too far round STOP Yet it certainly _would_ be cooler He stood, hesitating, looking
first one way and then the othera melancholy picture of utter infirmity
of purpose STOP How long this humiliating scene would have continued, if _I_ had been
the only external influence, it is impossible to say; for at this moment
Sylvie, with a swift decision worthy of Napoleon himself, took the
matter into her own hands STOP You go and drive _her_, up this way, she
said to Bruno STOP Ill get _him_ along STOP And she took hold of the stick
that Arthur was carrying, and gently pulled him down the lane STOP He was totally unconscious that any will but his own was acting on the
stick, and appeared to think it had taken a horizontal position simply
because he was pointing with it STOP Are not those _orchises_ under the
hedge there STOP he said STOP I think that decides me STOP Ill gather some as I
go along STOP [Illustration: ARE NOT THOSE ORCHISES? STOP Meanwhile Bruno had run on beyond Lady Muriel, and, with much jumping
about and shouting (shouts audible to no one but Sylvie and myself),
much as if he were driving sheep, he managed to turn her round and make
her walk, with eyes demurely cast upon the ground, in our direction STOP The victory was ours STOP And, since it was evident that the lovers, thus
urged together, _must_ meet in another minute, I turned and walked on,
hoping that Sylvie and Bruno would follow my example, as I felt sure
that the fewer the spectators the better it would be for Arthur and his
good angel STOP And what sort of meeting was it STOP I wondered, as I paced dreamily on STOP  STOP THE DOG-KING STOP They shooked hands, said Bruno, who was trotting at my side, in answer
to the unspoken question STOP And they looked _ever_ so pleased STOP Sylvie added from the other side STOP Well, we must get on, now, as quick as we can, I said STOP If only I knew
the best way to Hunters farm STOP Theyll be sure to know in this cottage, said Sylvie STOP Yes, I suppose they will STOP Bruno, would you run in and ask STOP Sylvie stopped him, laughingly, as he ran off STOP Wait a minute, she
said STOP I must make you _visible_ first, you know STOP And _audible_ too, I suppose STOP I said, as she took the jewel, that hung
round her neck, and waved it over his head, and touched his eyes and
lips with it STOP Yes, said Sylvie: and _once_, do you know, I made him _audible_, and
forgot to make him _visible_ STOP And he went to buy some sweeties in a
shop STOP And the man _was_ so frightened STOP A voice seemed to come out of the
air, Please, I want two ounces of barley-sugar drops STOP And a shilling
came _bang_ down upon the counter STOP And the man said I cant _see_
you STOP And Bruno said It doosnt sinnify seeing _me_, so long as oo can
see the _shilling_ STOP But the man said he never sold barley-sugar drops
to people he couldnt _see_ STOP So we had to_Now_, Bruno, youre ready STOP And away he trotted STOP Sylvie spent the time, while we were waiting for him, in making
_herself_ visible also STOP Its rather awkward, you know, she explained
to me, when we meet people, and they can see _one_ of us, and cant
see the _other_ STOP In a minute or two Bruno returned, looking rather disconsolate STOP Hed
got friends with him, and he were _cross_ STOP he said STOP He asked me who I
were STOP And I said Im Bruno: who is _these_ peoples STOP And he said Ones
my half-brother, and tothers my half-sister: and I dont want no more
company STOP Go along with yer STOP And I said I cant go along _wizout_ mine
self STOP And I said Oo shouldnt have _bits_ of peoples lying about like
that STOP Its welly untidy STOP And he said Oh, dont talk to _me_ STOP And he
pushted me outside STOP And he shutted the door STOP And you never asked where Hunters farm was STOP queried Sylvie STOP Hadnt room for any questions, said Bruno STOP The room were so crowded STOP Three people _couldnt_ crowd a room, said Sylvie STOP They _did_, though, Bruno persisted STOP _He_ crowded it most STOP Hes such
a welly _thick_ manso as oo couldnt knock him down STOP I failed to see the drift of Brunos argument STOP Surely _anybody_ could
be knocked down, I said: thick or thin wouldnt matter STOP Oo couldnt knock _him_ down, said Bruno STOP Hes more wider than hes
high: so, when hes lying down, hes more higher than when hes
standing: so a-course oo couldnt knock him _down_ STOP Heres another cottage, I said: _Ill_ ask the way, _this_ time STOP There was no need to go in, this time, as the woman was standing in the
doorway, with a baby in her arms, talking to a respectably dressed mana
farmer, as I guessedwho seemed to be on his way to the town STOP and when theres _drink_ to be had, he was saying, hes just the
worst o the lot, is your Willie STOP So they tell me STOP He gets fairly mad
wi it STOP Id have given em the lie to their faces, a twelvemonth back STOP the
woman said in a broken voice STOP But a canna noo STOP A canna noo STOP She
checked herself, on catching sight of us, and hastily retreated into the
house, shutting the door after her STOP Perhaps you can tell me where Hunters farm is STOP I said to the man, as
he turned away from the house STOP I can _that_, Sir STOP he replied with a smile STOP Im John Hunter hissel,
at your sarvice STOP Its nobbut half a mile furtherthe only house in
sight, when you get round bend o the road yonder STOP Youll find my good
woman within, if so be youve business wi _her_ STOP Or mebbe Ill do as
well STOP Thanks, I said STOP I want to order some milk STOP Perhaps I had better
arrange it with your wife STOP Aye, said the man STOP _She_ minds all _that_ STOP Good day tye, Masterand
to your bonnie childer, as well STOP And he trudged on STOP He should have said _child_, not _childer_, said Bruno STOP Sylvies
not a _childer_ STOP He meant _both_ of us, said Sylvie STOP No, he didnt STOP Bruno persisted STOP cause he said bonnie, oo know STOP Well, at any rate he _looked_ at us both, Sylvie maintained STOP Well, then he _must_ have seen were not _both_ bonnie STOP Bruno
retorted STOP A-_course_ Im much uglier than _oo_ STOP Didnt he mean
_Sylvie_, Mister Sir STOP he shouted over his shoulder, as he ran off STOP But there was no use in replying, as he had already vanished round the
bend of the road STOP When we overtook him he was climbing a gate, and was
gazing earnestly into the field, where a horse, a cow, and a kid were
browsing amicably together STOP For its father, a _Horse_, he murmured to
himself STOP For its mother, a _Cow_ STOP For their dear little child, a
_little_ Goat, is the most curiousest thing I ever seen in my world STOP Brunos World STOP I pondered STOP Yes, I suppose every child has a world of
his ownand every man, too, for the matter of that STOP I wonder if _thats_
the cause for all the misunderstanding there is in Life STOP That _must_ be Hunters farm STOP said Sylvie, pointing to a house on the
brow of the hill, led up to by a cart-road STOP Theres no other farm in
sight, _this_ way; and you _said_ we must be nearly there by this time STOP I had _thought_ it, while Bruno was climbing the gate, but I couldnt
remember having _said_ it STOP However, Sylvie was evidently in the right STOP Get down, Bruno, I said, and open the gate for us STOP Its a good thing wes with oo, _isnt_ it, Mister Sir STOP said Bruno, as
we entered the field STOP That big dog might have bited oo, if ood been
alone STOP Oo neednt be _flightened_ of it STOP he whispered, clinging tight
to my hand to encourage me STOP It arent fierce STOP Fierce STOP Sylvie scornfully echoed, as the doga magnificent
Newfoundlandthat had come galloping down the field to meet us, began
curveting round us, in gambols full of graceful beauty, and welcoming us
with short joyful barks STOP Fierce STOP Why, its as gentle as a lamb STOP Itswhy, Bruno, dont you know it STOP Its

So it _are_ STOP cried Bruno, rushing forwards and throwing his arms round
its neck STOP Oh, you _dear_ dog STOP And it seemed as if the two children
would never have done hugging and stroking it STOP And how _ever_ did he get _here_ STOP said Bruno STOP Ask him, Sylvie STOP I
doosnt know how STOP And then began an eager talk in Doggee, which of course was lost upon
_me_; and I could only _guess_, when the beautiful creature, with a sly
glance at me, whispered something in Sylvies ear, that _I_ was now the
subject of conversation STOP Sylvie looked round laughingly STOP He asked me who you are, she explained STOP And I said Hes our
_friend_ STOP And he said Whats his name STOP And I said Its _Mister
Sir_ STOP And he said Bosh STOP What is Bosh STOP in Doggee STOP I enquired STOP Its the same as in English, said Sylvie STOP Only, when a _dog_ says it,
its a sort of a whisper, thats half a _cough_ and half a _bark_ STOP Nero,
say _Bosh!_

And Nero, who had now begun gamboling round us again, said _Bosh!_
several times; and I found that Sylvies description of the sound was
perfectly accurate STOP I wonder whats behind this long wall STOP I said, as we walked on STOP Its the _Orchard_, Sylvie replied, after a consultation with Nero STOP See, theres a boy getting down off the wall, at that far corner STOP And
now hes running away across the field STOP I do believe hes been stealing
the apples STOP Bruno set off after him, but returned to us in a few moments, as he had
evidently no chance of overtaking the young rascal STOP I couldnt catch him STOP he said STOP I wiss Id started a little sooner STOP His pockets _was_ full of apples STOP The Dog-King looked up at Sylvie, and said something in Doggee STOP Why, of _course_ you can STOP Sylvie exclaimed STOP How stupid not to think
of it STOP _Nero_ll hold him for us, Bruno STOP But Id better make him
invisible, first STOP And she hastily got out the Magic Jewel, and began
waving it over Neros head, and down along his back STOP Thatll do STOP cried Bruno, impatiently STOP After him, good Doggie STOP Oh, Bruno STOP Sylvie exclaimed reproachfully STOP You shouldnt have sent
him off so quick STOP I hadnt done the tail STOP Meanwhile Nero was coursing like a greyhound down the field: so at least
I concluded from all _I_ could see of himthe long feathery tail, which
floated like a meteor through the airand in a very few seconds he had
come up with the little thief STOP Hes got him safe, by one foot STOP cried Sylvie, who was eagerly watching
the chase STOP Now theres no hurry, Bruno STOP So we walked, quite leisurely, down the field, to where the frightened
lad stood STOP A more curious sight I had seldom seen, in all my eerie
experiences STOP Every bit of him was in violent action, except the left
foot, which was apparently glued to the groundthere being nothing
visibly holding it: while, at some little distance, the long feathery
tail was waving gracefully from side to side, showing that Nero, at
least, regarded the whole affair as nothing but a magnificent game of
play STOP Whats the matter with you STOP I said, as gravely as I could STOP Got the crahmp in me ahnkle STOP the thief groaned in reply STOP An me futs
gone to sleep STOP And he began to blubber aloud STOP Now, look here STOP Bruno said in a commanding tone, getting in front of
him STOP Oove got to give up those apples STOP The lad glanced at me, but didnt seem to reckon _my_ interference as
worth anything STOP Then he glanced at Sylvie: _she_ clearly didnt count
for very much, either STOP Then he took courage STOP Itll take a better man
than any of _yer_ to get em STOP he retorted defiantly STOP [Illustration: A ROYAL THIEF-TAKER]

Sylvie stooped and patted the invisible Nero STOP A _little_ tighter STOP she
whispered STOP And a sharp yell from the ragged boy showed how promptly the
Dog-King had taken the hint STOP Whats the matter _now_ STOP I said STOP Is your ankle worse STOP And itll get worse, and worse, and worse, Bruno solemnly assured him,
till oo gives up those apples STOP Apparently the thief was convinced of this at last, and he sulkily began
emptying his pockets of the apples STOP The children watched from a little
distance, Bruno dancing with delight at every fresh yell extracted from
Neros terrified prisoner STOP Thats all, the boy said at last STOP It _isnt_ all STOP cried Bruno STOP Theres three more in that pocket STOP Another hint from Sylvie to the Dog-Kinganother sharp yell from the
thief, now convicted of lying alsoand the remaining three apples were
surrendered STOP Let him go, please, Sylvie said in Doggee, and the lad limped away at
a great pace, stooping now and then to rub the ailing ankle, in fear,
seemingly, that the crahmp might attack it again STOP [Illustration: SUMMAT WRONG WI MY SPECTACLES! STOP Bruno ran back, with his booty, to the orchard wall, and pitched the
apples over it one by one STOP Is welly afraid _some_ of thems gone under
the wrong trees STOP he panted, on overtaking us again STOP The _wrong_ trees STOP laughed Sylvie STOP Trees _cant_ do wrong STOP Theres
no such things as _wrong_ trees STOP Then theres no such things as _right_ trees, neither STOP cried Bruno STOP And Sylvie gave up the point STOP Wait a minute, please STOP she said to me STOP I must make Nero _visible_,
you know STOP No, _please_ dont STOP cried Bruno, who had by this time mounted on the
Royal back, and was twisting the Royal hair into a bridle STOP Itll be
_such_ fun to have him like this STOP Well, it _does_ look funny, Sylvie admitted, and led the way to the
farm-house, where the farmers wife stood, evidently much perplexed at
the weird procession now approaching her STOP Its summat gone wrong wi my
spectacles, I doubt STOP she murmured, as she took them off, and began
diligently rubbing them with a corner of her apron STOP Meanwhile Sylvie had hastily pulled Bruno down from his steed, and had
just time to make His Majesty wholly visible before the spectacles were
resumed STOP All was natural, now; but the good woman still looked a little uneasy
about it STOP My eyesights getting bad, she said, but I see you _now_,
my darlings STOP Youll give me a kiss, wont you STOP Bruno got behind me, in a moment: however Sylvie put up _her_ face, to
be kissed, as representative of _both_, and we all went in together STOP  STOP MATILDA JANE STOP Come to me, my little gentleman, said our hostess, lifting Bruno into
her lap, and tell me everything STOP I cant, said Bruno STOP There wouldnt be time STOP Besides, I dont _know_
everything STOP The good woman looked a little puzzled, and turned to Sylvie for help STOP Does he like _riding_ STOP she asked STOP Yes, I _think_ so, Sylvie gently replied STOP Hes just had a ride on
_Nero_ STOP Ah, Neros a grand dog, isnt he STOP Were you ever outside a _horse_, my
little man STOP _Always!_ Bruno said with great decision STOP Never was _inside_ one STOP Was
_oo_ STOP Here I thought it well to interpose, and to mention the business on
which we had come, and so relieved her, for a few minutes, from Brunos
perplexing questions STOP And those dear children will like a bit of cake, _Ill_ warrant STOP said
the farmers hospitable wife, when the business was concluded, as she
opened her cupboard, and brought out a cake STOP And dont you waste the
crust, little gentleman STOP she added, as she handed a good slice of it to
Bruno STOP You know what the poetry-book says about wilful waste STOP No, I dont, said Bruno STOP What doos he say about it STOP Tell him, Bessie STOP And the mother looked down, proudly and lovingly, on
a rosy little maiden, who had just crept shyly into the room, and was
leaning against her knee STOP Whats that your poetry-book says about
wilful waste STOP _For wilful waste makes woeful want_, Bessie recited, in an almost
inaudible whisper: _and you may live to say How much I wish I had the
crust that then I threw away!_

Now try if _you_ can say it, my dear STOP _For wilful_

_For wifful_sumfinoruvver Bruno began, readily enough; and then
there came a dead pause STOP Cant remember no more STOP Well, what do you _learn_ from it, then STOP You can tell us _that_, at any
rate STOP Bruno ate a little more cake, and considered: but the moral did not seem
to him to be a very obvious one STOP Always to Sylvie prompted him in a whisper STOP Always to Bruno softly repeated: and then, with sudden inspiration,
always to look where it goes to STOP Where _what_ goes to, darling STOP Why the _crust_, a course STOP said Bruno STOP Then, if I lived to say _How
much I wiss I had the crust_ (and all that), Id know where I frew it
to STOP This new interpretation quite puzzled the good woman STOP She returned to
the subject of Bessie STOP Wouldnt you like to see Bessies doll, my
dears STOP Bessie, take the little lady and gentleman to see Matilda Jane STOP Bessies shyness thawed away in a moment STOP Matilda Jane has just woke
up, she stated, confidentially, to Sylvie STOP Wont you help me on with
her frock STOP Them strings _is_ such a bother to tie STOP I can tie _strings_, we heard, in Sylvies gentle voice, as the two
little girls left the room together STOP Bruno ignored the whole proceeding,
and strolled to the window, quite with the air of a fashionable
gentleman STOP Little girls, and dolls, were not at all in his line STOP And forthwith the fond mother proceeded to tell me (as what mother is
not ready to do? STOP of all Bessies virtues (and vices too, for the matter
of that) and of the many fearful maladies which, notwithstanding those
ruddy cheeks and that plump little figure, had nearly, time and again,
swept her from the face of the earth STOP When the full stream of loving memories had nearly run itself out, I
began to question her about the working men of that neighbourhood, and
specially the Willie, whom we had heard of at his cottage STOP He was a
good fellow once, said my kind hostess: but its the drink has ruined
him STOP Not that Id rob them of the drinkits good for the most of
thembut theres some as is too weak to stand agin temptations: its a
thousand pities, for _them_, as they ever built the Golden Lion at the
corner there STOP The Golden Lion STOP I repeated STOP Its the new Public, my hostess explained STOP And it stands right in the
way, and handy for the workmen, as they come back from the brickfields,
as it might be to-day, with their weeks wages STOP A deal of money gets
wasted that way STOP And some of em gets drunk STOP If only they could have it in their own houses I mused, hardly
knowing I had said the words out loud STOP Thats it STOP she eagerly exclaimed STOP It was evidently a solution, of the
problem, that she had already thought out STOP If only you could manage,
sos each man to have his own little barrel in his own housethered
hardly be a drunken man in the length and breadth of the land STOP And then I told her the old storyabout a certain cottager who bought
himself a little barrel of beer, and installed his wife as bar-keeper:
and how, every time he wanted his mug of beer, he regularly paid her
over the counter for it: and how she never would let him go on tick,
and was a perfectly inflexible bar-keeper in never letting him have more
than his proper allowance: and how, every time the barrel needed
refilling, she had plenty to do it with, and something over for her
money-box: and how, at the end of the year, he not only found himself in
first-rate health and spirits, with that undefinable but quite
unmistakeable air which always distinguishes the sober man from the one
who takes a drop too much, but had quite a box full of money, all
saved out of his own pence STOP If only theyd all do like that STOP said the good woman, wiping her eyes,
which were overflowing with kindly sympathy STOP Drink hadnt need to be
the curse it is to some

Only a _curse_, I said, when it is used wrongly STOP Any of Gods gifts
may be turned into a curse, unless we use it wisely STOP But we must be
getting home STOP Would you call the little girls STOP Matilda Jane has seen
enough of company, for _one_ day, Im sure STOP Ill find em in a minute, said my hostess, as she rose to leave the
room STOP Maybe that young gentleman saw which way they went STOP Where are they, Bruno STOP I said STOP They aint in the field, was Brunos rather evasive reply, cause
theres nothing but _pigs_ there, and Sylvie isnt a pig STOP Now dont
imperrupt me any more, cause Im telling a story to this fly; and it
wont attend STOP Theyre among the apples, Ill warrant em STOP said the Farmers wife STOP So
we left Bruno to finish his story, and went out into the orchard, where
we soon came upon the children, walking sedately side by side, Sylvie
carrying the doll, while little Bess carefully shaded its face, with a
large cabbage-leaf for a parasol STOP As soon as they caught sight of us, little Bess dropped her cabbage-leaf
and came running to meet us, Sylvie following more slowly, as her
precious charge evidently needed great care and attention STOP Im its Mamma, and Sylvies the Head-Nurse, Bessie explained: and
Sylvies taught me ever such a pretty song, for me to sing to Matilda
Jane STOP Lets hear it once more, Sylvie, I said, delighted at getting the
chance I had long wished for, of hearing her sing STOP But Sylvie turned shy
and frightened in a moment STOP No, _please_ not STOP she said, in an earnest
aside to me STOP Bessie knows it quite perfect now STOP Bessie can sing it STOP Aye, aye STOP Let Bessie sing it STOP said the proud mother STOP Bessie has a
bonny voice of her own, (this again was an aside to me) though I say
it as shouldnt STOP Bessie was only too happy to accept the encore STOP So the plump little
Mamma sat down at our feet, with her hideous daughter reclining stiffly
across her lap (it was one of a kind that wont sit down, under _any_
amount of persuasion), and, with a face simply beaming with delight,
began the lullaby, in a shout that _ought_ to have frightened the poor
baby into fits STOP The Head-Nurse crouched down behind her, keeping herself
respectfully in the back-ground, with her hands on the shoulders of her
little mistress, so as to be ready to act as Prompter, if required, and
to supply _each gap in faithless memory void_ STOP [Illustration: BESSIES SONG]

The shout, with which she began, proved to be only a momentary effort STOP After a very few notes, Bessie toned down, and sang on in a small but
very sweet voice STOP At first her great black eyes were fixed on her
mother, but soon her gaze wandered upwards, among the apples, and she
seemed to have quite forgotten that she had any other audience than her
Baby, and her Head-Nurse, who once or twice supplied, almost inaudibly,
the right note, when the singer was getting a little flat STOP Matilda Jane, you never look
  At any toy or picture-book:
  I show you pretty things in vain
  You must be blind, Matilda Jane STOP I ask you riddles, tell you tales,
  But _all_ our conversation fails:
  You _never_ answer me again
  I fear youre dumb, Matilda Jane STOP Matilda, darling, when I call,
  You never seem to hear at all:
  I shout with all my might and main
  But youre _so_ deaf, Matilda Jane STOP Matilda Jane, you neednt mind;
  For, though youre deaf, and dumb, and blind,
  Theres _some one_ loves you, it is plain
  And that is _me,_ Matilda Jane STOP She sang three of the verses in a rather perfunctory style, but the last
stanza evidently excited the little maiden STOP Her voice rose, ever clearer
and louder: she had a rapt look on her face, as if suddenly inspired,
and, as she sang the last few words, she clasped to her heart the
inattentive Matilda Jane STOP Kiss it now STOP prompted the Head-Nurse STOP And in a moment the simpering
meaningless face of the Baby was covered with a shower of passionate
kisses STOP What a bonny song STOP cried the Farmers wife STOP Who made the words,
dearie STOP II think Ill look for Bruno, Sylvie said demurely, and left us
hastily STOP The curious child seemed always afraid of being praised, or
even noticed STOP Sylvie planned the words, Bessie informed us, proud of her superior
information: and Bruno planned the musicand _I_ sang it STOP (this last
circumstance, by the way, we did not need to be told) STOP So we followed Sylvie, and all entered the parlour together STOP Bruno was
still standing at the window, with his elbows on the sill STOP He had,
apparently, finished the story that he was telling to the fly, and had
found a new occupation STOP Dont imperrupt STOP he said as we came in STOP Im
counting the Pigs in the field STOP How many are there STOP I enquired STOP About a thousand and four, said Bruno STOP You mean about a thousand, Sylvie corrected him STOP Theres no good
saying _and four_: you _cant_ be sure about the four STOP And youre as wrong as ever STOP Bruno exclaimed triumphantly STOP Its just
the _four_ I _can_ be sure about; cause theyre here, grubbling under
the window STOP Its the _thousand_ I isnt pruffickly sure about STOP But some of them have gone into the sty, Sylvie said, leaning over him
to look out of the window STOP Yes, said Bruno; but they went so slowly and so fewly, I didnt care
to count _them_ STOP We must be going, children, I said STOP Wish Bessie good-bye STOP Sylvie
flung her arms round the little maidens neck, and kissed her: but Bruno
stood aloof, looking unusually shy STOP (I never kiss _nobody_ but Sylvie STOP he explained to me afterwards. STOP The farmers wife showed us out: and we
were soon on our way back to Elveston STOP And thats the new public-house that we were talking about, I suppose STOP I said, as we came in sight of a long low building, with the words The
Golden Lion over the door STOP Yes, thats it, said Sylvie STOP I wonder if _her_ Willies inside STOP Run
in, Bruno, and see if hes there STOP I interposed, feeling that Bruno was, in a sort of way, in _my_ care STOP Thats not a place to send a child into STOP For already the revelers were
getting noisy: and a wild discord of singing, shouting, and meaningless
laughter came to us through the open windows STOP They wont _see_ him, you know, Sylvie explained STOP Wait a minute,
Bruno STOP She clasped the jewel, that always hung round her neck, between
the palms of her hands, and muttered a few words to herself STOP What they
were I could not at all make out, but some mysterious change seemed
instantly to pass over us STOP My feet seemed to me no longer to press the
ground, and the dream-like feeling came upon me, that I was suddenly
endowed with the power of floating in the air STOP I could still just _see_
the children: but their forms were shadowy and unsubstantial, and their
voices sounded as if they came from some distant place and time, they
were so unreal STOP However, I offered no further opposition to Brunos
going into the house STOP He was back again in a few moments STOP No, he isnt
come yet, he said STOP Theyre talking about him inside, and saying how
drunk he was last week STOP While he was speaking, one of the men lounged out through the door, a
pipe in one hand and a mug of beer in the other, and crossed to where we
were standing, so as to get a better view along the road STOP Two or three
others leaned out through the open window, each holding his mug of beer,
with red faces and sleepy eyes STOP Canst see him, lad STOP one of them asked STOP I dunnot know, the man said, taking a step forwards, which brought us
nearly face to face STOP Sylvie hastily pulled me out of his way STOP Thanks,
child, I said STOP I had forgotten he couldnt see us STOP What would have
happened if I had staid in his way STOP I dont know, Sylvie said gravely STOP It wouldnt matter to _us_; but
_you_ may be different STOP She said this in her usual voice, but the man
took no sort of notice, though she was standing close in front of him,
and looking up into his face as she spoke STOP Hes coming now STOP cried Bruno, pointing down the road STOP He be a-coomin noo STOP echoed the man, stretching out his arm exactly
over Brunos head, and pointing with his pipe STOP Then _chorus_ agin STOP was shouted out by one of the red-faced men in the
window: and forthwith a dozen voices yelled, to a harsh discordant
melody, the refrain:

  Theres him, an yo an me,
            Roarin laddies STOP We loves a bit o spree,
  Roarin laddies we,
            Roarin laddies
            Roarin laddies STOP The man lounged back again to the house, joining lustily in the chorus
as he went: so that only the children and I were in the road when
Willie came up STOP  STOP WILLIES WIFE STOP He made for the door of the public-house, but the children intercepted
him STOP Sylvie clung to one arm; while Bruno, on the opposite side, was
pushing him with all his strength, with many inarticulate cries of
Gee-up STOP Gee-back STOP Woah then STOP which he had picked up from the
waggoners STOP Willie took not the least notice of them: he was simply conscious that
_something_ had checked him: and, for want of any other way of
accounting for it, he seemed to regard it as his own act STOP [Illustration: THE RESCUE OF WILLIE]

I wunnut coom in, he said: not to-day STOP A mug o beer wunnut hurt ee STOP his friends shouted in chorus STOP _Two_
mugs wunnut hurt ee STOP Nor a dozen mugs STOP Nay, said Willie STOP Im agoan whoam STOP What, withouten thy drink, Willie man STOP shouted the others STOP But Willie
man would have no more discussion, and turned doggedly away, the
children keeping one on each side of him, to guard him against any
change in his sudden resolution STOP For a while he walked on stoutly enough, keeping his hands in his
pockets, and softly whistling a tune, in time to his heavy tread: his
success, in appearing entirely at his ease, was _almost_ complete; but a
careful observer would have noted that he had forgotten the second part
of the air, and that, when it broke down, he instantly began it again,
being too nervous to think of another, and too restless to endure
silence STOP It was not the old fear that possessed him nowthe old fear, that had
been his dreary companion every Saturday night he could remember, as he
had reeled along, steadying himself against gates and garden-palings,
and when the shrill reproaches of his wife had seemed to his dazed brain
only the echo of a yet more piercing voice within, the intolerable wail
of a hopeless remorse: it was a wholly new fear that had come to him
now: life had taken on itself a new set of colours, and was lighted up
with a new and dazzling radiance, and he did not see, as yet, how his
home-life, and his wife and child, would fit into the new order of
things: the very novelty of it all was, to his simple mind, a perplexity
and an overwhelming terror STOP And now the tune died into sudden silence on the trembling lips, as he
turned a sharp corner, and came in sight of his own cottage, where his
wife stood, leaning with folded arms on the wicket-gate, and looking up
the road with a pale face, that had in it no glimmer of the light of
hopeonly the heavy shadow of a deep stony despair STOP Fine an early, lad STOP Fine an early STOP The words might have been words
of welcoming, but oh, the bitterness of the tone in which she said it STOP What brings thee from thy merry mates, and all the fiddling and the
jigging STOP Pockets empty, I doubt STOP Or thoust come, mebbe, for to see thy
little one die STOP The bairnies clemmed, and Ive nor bite nor sup to gie
her STOP But what does _thou_ care STOP She flung the gate open, and met him
with blazing eyes of fury STOP The man said no word STOP Slowly, and with downcast eyes, he passed into the
house, while she, half terrified at his strange silence, followed him in
without another word; and it was not till he had sunk into a chair, with
his arms crossed on the table and with drooping head, that she found her
voice again STOP It seemed entirely natural for us to go in with them: at another time
one would have asked leave for this, but I felt, I knew not why, that we
were in some mysterious way invisible, and as free to come and to go as
disembodied spirits STOP The child in the cradle woke up, and raised a piteous cry, which in a
moment brought the children to its side: Bruno rocked the cradle, while
Sylvie tenderly replaced the little head on the pillow from which it had
slipped STOP But the mother took no heed of the cry, nor yet of the
satisfied coo that it set up when Sylvie had made it happy again: she
only stood gazing at her husband, and vainly trying, with white
quivering lips (I believe she thought he was mad), to speak in the old
tones of shrill upbraiding that he knew so well STOP And thoust spent all thy wagesIll swear thou haston the devils own
drinkand thoust been and made thysen a beast againas thou allus
dost

Hasna STOP the man muttered, his voice hardly rising above a whisper, as
he slowly emptied his pockets on the table STOP Theres th wage, Missus,
every penny ont STOP The woman gasped, and put one hand to her heart, as if under some great
shock of surprise STOP Then _how_s thee gotten th drink STOP _Hasna_ gotten it, he answered her, in a tone more sad than sullen STOP I
hanna touched a drop this blessed day STOP No STOP he cried aloud, bringing his
clenched fist heavily down upon the table, and looking up at her with
gleaming eyes, nor Ill never touch another drop o the cursed
drinktill I dieso help me God my Maker STOP His voice, which had suddenly
risen to a hoarse shout, dropped again as suddenly: and once more he
bowed his head, and buried his face in his folded arms STOP [Illustration: WILLIES WIFE]

The woman had dropped upon her knees by the cradle, while he was
speaking STOP She neither looked at him nor seemed to hear him STOP With hands
clasped above her head, she rocked herself wildly to and fro STOP Oh my
God STOP Oh my God STOP was all she said, over and over again STOP Sylvie and Bruno gently unclasped her hands and drew them downtill she
had an arm round each of them, though she took no notice of them, but
knelt on with eyes gazing upwards, and lips that moved as if in silent
thanksgiving STOP The man kept his face hidden, and uttered no sound: but
one could _see_ the sobs that shook him from head to foot STOP After a while he raised his headhis face all wet with tears STOP Polly STOP he said softly; and then, louder, Old Poll STOP Then she rose from her knees and came to him, with a dazed look, as if
she were walking in her sleep STOP Who was it called me old Poll STOP she
asked: her voice took on it a tender playfulness: her eyes sparkled; and
the rosy light of Youth flushed her pale cheeks, till she looked more
like a happy girl of seventeen than a worn woman of forty STOP Was that my
own lad, my Willie, a-waiting for me at the stile STOP His face too was transformed, in the same magic light, to the likeness
of a bashful boy: and boy and girl they seemed, as he wound an arm about
her, and drew her to his side, while with the other hand he thrust from
him the heap of money, as though it were something hateful to the touch STOP Tak it, lass, he said, tak it all STOP An fetch us summat to eat: but
get a sup o milk, first, for t bairn STOP My _little_ bairn STOP she murmured as she gathered up the coins STOP My own
little lassie STOP Then she moved to the door, and was passing out, but a
sudden thought seemed to arrest her: she hastily returnedfirst to kneel
down and kiss the sleeping child, and then to throw herself into her
husbands arms and be strained to his heart STOP The next moment she was on
her way, taking with her a jug that hung on a peg near the door: we
followed close behind STOP We had not gone far before we came in sight of a swinging sign-board
bearing the word DAIRY on it, and here she went in, welcomed by a
little curly white dog, who, not being under the eerie influence, saw
the children, and received them with the most effusive affection STOP When I
got inside, the dairyman was in the act of taking the money STOP Ist for
thysen, Missus, or for t bairn STOP he asked, when he had filled the jug,
pausing with it in his hand STOP For t _bairn_ STOP she said, almost reproachfully STOP Thinkst tha Id
touch a drop _mysen_, while as _she_ hadna got her fill STOP All right, Missus, the man replied, turning away with the jug in his
hand STOP Lets just mak sure its good measure STOP He went back among his
shelves of milk-bowls, carefully keeping his back towards her while he
emptied a little measure of cream into the jug, muttering to himself
mebbe itll hearten her up a bit, the little lassie STOP The woman never noticed the kind deed, but took back the jug with a
simple Good evening, Master, and went her way: but the children had
been more observant, and, as we followed her out, Bruno remarked That
were _welly_ kind: and I loves that man: and if I was welly rich Id
give him a hundred poundsand a bun STOP That little grummeling dog doosnt
know its business STOP He referred to the dairymans little dog, who had
apparently quite forgotten the affectionate welcome he had given us on
our arrival, and was now following at a respectful distance, doing his
best to _speed the parting guest_ with a shower of little shrill
barks, that seemed to tread on one anothers heels STOP What _is_ a dogs business STOP laughed Sylvie STOP Dogs cant keep shops
and give change STOP Sisters businesses _isnt_ to laugh at their brothers, Bruno replied
with perfect gravity STOP And dogs businesses is to _bark_not like that:
it should finish one bark before it begins another: and it shouldOh
Sylvie, theres some dindledums STOP And in another moment the happy children were flying across the common,
racing for the patch of dandelions STOP While I stood watching them, a strange dreamy feeling came upon me: a
railway-platform seemed to take the place of the green sward, and,
instead of the light figure of Sylvie bounding along, I seemed to see
the flying form of Lady Muriel; but whether Bruno had also undergone a
transformation, and had become the old man whom she was running to
overtake, I was unable to judge, so instantaneously did the feeling come
and go STOP When I re-entered the little sitting-room which I shared with Arthur, he
was standing with his back to me, looking out of the open window, and
evidently had not heard me enter STOP A cup of tea, apparently just tasted
and pushed aside, stood on the table, on the opposite side of which was
a letter, just begun, with the pen lying across it: an open book lay on
the sofa: the London paper occupied the easy chair; and on the little
table, which stood by it, I noticed an unlighted cigar and an open box
of cigar-lights: all things betokened that the Doctor, usually so
methodical and so self-contained, had been trying every form of
occupation, and could settle to none STOP This is very unlike _you_, Doctor STOP I was beginning, but checked
myself, as he turned at the sound of my voice, in sheer amazement at the
wonderful change that had taken place in his appearance STOP Never had I
seen a face so radiant with happiness, or eyes that sparkled with such
unearthly light STOP Even thus, I thought, must the herald-angel have
looked, who brought to the shepherds, watching over their flocks by
night, that sweet message of _peace on earth, good-will to men_ STOP Yes, dear friend STOP he said, as if in answer to the question that I
suppose he read in my face STOP It is true STOP It is true STOP No need to ask _what_ was true STOP God bless you both STOP I said, as I felt
the happy tears brimming to my eyes STOP You were made for each other STOP Yes, he said, simply, I believe we were STOP And _what_ a change it makes
in ones Life STOP This isnt the same world STOP That isnt the sky I saw
yesterday STOP Those cloudsI never saw such clouds in all my life before STOP They look like troops of hovering angels STOP To _me_ they looked very ordinary clouds indeed: but then _I_ had not
fed _on honey-dew, And drunk the milk of Paradise_ STOP She wants to see youat once, he continued, descending suddenly to the
things of earth STOP She says _that_ is the _one_ drop yet wanting in her
cup of happiness STOP Ill go at once, I said, as I turned to leave the room STOP Wont you
come with me STOP No, Sir STOP said the Doctor, with a sudden effortwhich proved an utter
failureto resume his professional manner STOP Do I _look_ like coming with
you STOP Have you never heard that two is company, and

Yes, I said, I _have_ heard it: and Im painfully aware that_ I_ am
_Number Three_ STOP But, _when_ shall we three meet again STOP _When the hurly-burlys done!_ he answered with a happy laugh, such as
I had not heard from him for many a year STOP  STOP MEIN HERR STOP So I went on my lonely way, and, on reaching the Hall, I found Lady
Muriel standing at the garden-gate waiting for me STOP No need to _give_ you joy, or to _wish_ you joy STOP I began STOP None _whatever_ STOP she replied, with the joyous laugh of a child STOP We
_give_ people what they havent got: we _wish_ for something that is yet
to come STOP For _me_, its all _here_ STOP Its all _mine_ STOP Dear friend, she
suddenly broke off, do you think Heaven ever begins on _Earth_, for any
of us STOP For _some_, I said STOP For some, perhaps, who are simple and childlike STOP You know He said of such is the Kingdom of Heaven STOP Lady Muriel clasped her hands, and gazed up into the cloudless sky, with
a look I had often seen in Sylvies eyes STOP I feel as if it had begun for
_me_, she almost whispered STOP I feel as if _I_ were one of the happy
children, whom He bid them bring near to Him, though the people would
have kept them back STOP Yes, He has seen me in the throng STOP He has read the
wistful longing in my eyes STOP He has beckoned me to Him STOP They have _had_
to make way for me STOP He has taken me up in His arms STOP He has put His hands
upon me and blessed me STOP She paused, breathless in her perfect
happiness STOP Yes, I said STOP I think He has STOP You must come and speak to my father, she went on, as we stood side by
side at the gate, looking down the shady lane STOP But, even as she said the
words, the eerie sensation came over me like a flood: I saw the dear
old Professor approaching us, and also saw, what was stranger still,
that he was visible to _Lady Muriel_ STOP What was to be done STOP Had the fairy-life been merged in the real life STOP Or
was Lady Muriel eerie also, and thus able to enter into the
fairy-world along with me STOP The words were on my lips (I see an old
friend of mine in the lane: if you dont know him, may I introduce him
to you? STOP when the strangest thing of all happened: Lady Muriel spoke STOP I see an old friend of mine in the lane, she said: if you dont know
him, may I introduce him to you STOP I seemed to wake out of a dream: for the eerie feeling was still
strong upon me, and the figure outside seemed to be changing at every
moment, like one of the shapes in a kaleidoscope: now he was the
_Professor_, and now he was somebody else STOP By the time he had reached
the gate, he certainly was somebody else: and I felt that the proper
course was for _Lady Muriel_, not for _me_, to introduce him STOP She
greeted him kindly, and, opening the gate, admitted the venerable old
mana German, obviouslywho looked about him with dazed eyes, as if
_he_, too, had but just awaked from a dream STOP No, it was certainly _not_ the Professor STOP My old friend _could_ not have
grown that magnificent beard since last we met: moreover, he would have
recognised _me_, for I was certain that _I_ had not changed much in the
time STOP As it was, he simply looked at me vaguely, and took off his hat in
response to Lady Muriels words Let me introduce Mein Herr to you;
while in the words, spoken in a strong German accent, proud to make
your acquaintance, Sir STOP I could detect no trace of an idea that we had
ever met before STOP Lady Muriel led us to the well-known shady nook, where preparations for
afternoon tea had already been made, and, while she went in to look for
the Earl, we seated ourselves in two easy-chairs, and Mein Herr took
up Lady Muriels work, and examined it through his large spectacles (one
of the adjuncts that made him so provokingly like the Professor) STOP Hemming pocket-handkerchiefs STOP he said, musingly STOP So _that_ is what
the English miladies occupy themselves with, is it STOP It is the one accomplishment, I said, in which Man has never yet
rivaled Woman STOP Here Lady Muriel returned with her father; and, after he had exchanged
some friendly words with Mein Herr, and we had all been supplied with
the needful creature-comforts, the newcomer returned to the suggestive
subject of Pocket-handkerchiefs STOP You have heard of Fortunatuss Purse, Miladi STOP Ah, so STOP Would you be
surprised to hear that, with three of these leetle handkerchiefs, you
shall make the Purse of Fortunatus, quite soon, quite easily STOP Shall I indeed STOP Lady Muriel eagerly replied, as she took a heap of
them into her lap, and threaded her needle STOP _Please_ tell me how, Mein
Herr STOP Ill make one before I touch another drop of tea STOP You shall first, said Mein Herr, possessing himself of two of the
handkerchiefs, spreading one upon the other, and holding them up by two
corners, you shall first join together these upper corners, the right
to the right, the left to the left; and the opening between them shall
be the _mouth_ of the Purse STOP A very few stitches sufficed to carry out _this_ direction STOP Now, if I
sew the other three edges together, she suggested, the bag is
complete STOP Not so, Miladi: the _lower_ edges shall _first_ be joinedah, not so STOP (as she was beginning to sew them together) STOP Turn one of them over, and
join the _right_ lower corner of the one to the _left_ lower corner of
the other, and sew the lower edges together in what you would call _the
wrong way_ STOP _I_ see STOP said Lady Muriel, as she deftly executed the order STOP And a
very twisted, uncomfortable, uncanny-looking bag it makes STOP But the
_moral_ is a lovely one STOP Unlimited wealth can only be attained by doing
things _in the wrong way_ STOP And how are we to join up these
mysteriousno, I mean _this_ mysterious opening STOP (twisting the thing
round and round with a puzzled air. STOP Yes, it _is_ one opening STOP I
thought it was _two_, at first STOP You have seen the puzzle of the Paper Ring STOP Mein Herr said, addressing
the Earl STOP Where you take a slip of paper, and join its ends together,
first twisting one, so as to join the _upper_ corner of _one_ end to the
_lower_ corner of the _other_ STOP I saw one made, only yesterday, the Earl replied STOP Muriel, my child,
were you not making one, to amuse those children you had to tea STOP Yes, I know that Puzzle, said Lady Muriel STOP The Ring has only _one_
surface, and only _one_ edge STOP Its very mysterious STOP The _bag_ is just like that, isnt it STOP I suggested STOP Is not the
_outer_ surface of one side of it continuous with the _inner_ surface of
the other side STOP So it is STOP she exclaimed STOP Only it _isnt_ a bag, just yet STOP How shall
we fill up this opening, Mein Herr STOP Thus STOP said the old man impressively, taking the bag from her, and
rising to his feet in the excitement of the explanation STOP The edge of
the opening consists of _four_ handkerchief-edges, and you can trace it
continuously, round and round the opening: down the right edge of _one_
handkerchief, up the left edge of the _other_, and then down the left
edge of the _one_, and up the right edge of the _other_ STOP So you can STOP Lady Muriel murmured thoughtfully, leaning her head on her
hand, and earnestly watching the old man STOP And that _proves_ it to be
only _one_ opening STOP [Illustration: FORTUNATUS PURSE]

She looked so strangely like a child, puzzling over a difficult lesson,
and Mein Herr had become, for the moment, so strangely like the old
Professor, that I felt utterly bewildered: the eerie feeling was on me
in its full force, and I felt almost _impelled_ to say Do you
understand it, Sylvie STOP However I checked myself by a great effort, and
let the dream (if indeed it _was_ a dream) go on to its end STOP Now, this _third_ handkerchief, Mein Herr proceeded, has _also_ four
edges, which you can trace continuously round and round: all you need do
is to join its four edges to the four edges of the opening STOP The Purse is
then complete, and its outer surface

_I_ see STOP Lady Muriel eagerly interrupted STOP Its _outer_ surface will be
continuous with its _inner_ surface STOP But it will take time STOP Ill sew it
up after tea STOP She laid aside the bag and resumed her cup of tea STOP But
why do you call it Fortunatuss Purse, Mein Herr STOP The dear old man beamed upon her, with a jolly smile, looking more
exactly like the Professor than ever STOP Dont you see, my childI should
say Miladi STOP Whatever is _inside_ that Purse, is _outside_ it; and
whatever is _outside_ it, is _inside_ it STOP So you have all the wealth of
the world in that leetle Purse STOP His pupil clapped her hands, in unrestrained delight STOP Ill certainly
sew the third handkerchief in_some_ time, she said: but I wont take
up your time by trying it now STOP Tell us some more wonderful things,
please STOP And her face and her voice so _exactly_ recalled Sylvie, that I
could not help glancing round, half-expecting to see _Bruno_ also STOP Mein Herr began thoughtfully balancing his spoon on the edge of his
teacup, while he pondered over this request STOP Something wonderfullike
 Fortunatuss Purse STOP _That_ will give youwhen it is madewealth beyond
your wildest dreams: but it will not give you _Time_ STOP A pause of silence ensuedutilised by Lady Muriel for the very practical
purpose of refilling the teacups STOP In _your_ country, Mein Herr began with a startling abruptness, what
becomes of all the wasted Time STOP Lady Muriel looked grave STOP Who can tell STOP she half-whispered to herself STOP All one knows is that it is gonepast recall STOP Well, in _my_I mean in a country _I_ have visited, said the old man,
they store it up: and it comes in _very_ useful, years afterwards STOP For
example, suppose you have a long tedious evening before you: nobody to
talk to: nothing you care to do: and yet hours too soon to go to bed STOP How do _you_ behave then STOP I get _very_ cross, she frankly admitted: and I want to throw things
about the room STOP When that happens toto the people I have visited, they never act _so_ STOP By a short and simple processwhich I cannot explain to youthey store
up the useless hours: and, on some _other_ occasion, when they happen to
_need_ extra time, they get them out again STOP The Earl was listening with a slightly incredulous smile STOP Why cannot
you _explain_ the process STOP he enquired STOP Mein Herr was ready with a quite unanswerable reason STOP Because you have
no _words_, in _your_ language, to convey the ideas which are needed STOP I
could explain it ininbut you would not understand it STOP No indeed STOP said Lady Muriel, graciously dispensing with the _name_ of
the unknown language STOP I never learnt itat least, not to speak it
_fluently_, you know STOP _Please_ tell us some more wonderful things STOP They run their railway-trains without any enginesnothing is needed but
machinery to _stop_ them with STOP Is _that_ wonderful enough, Miladi STOP But where does the _force_ come from STOP I ventured to ask STOP Mein Herr turned quickly round, to look at the new speaker STOP Then he took
off his spectacles, and polished them, and looked at me again, in
evident bewilderment STOP I could see he was thinkingas indeed _I_ was
alsothat we _must_ have met before STOP They use the force of _gravity_, he said STOP It is a force known also in
_your_ country, I believe STOP But that would need a railway going _down-hill_, the Earl remarked STOP You cant have _all_ your railways going down-hill STOP They _all_ do, said Mein Herr STOP Not from _both_ ends STOP From _both_ ends STOP Then I give it up STOP said the Earl STOP Can you explain the process STOP said Lady Muriel STOP Without using that
language, that I cant speak fluently STOP Easily, said Mein Herr STOP Each railway is in a long tunnel, perfectly
straight: so of course the _middle_ of it is nearer the centre of the
globe than the two ends: so every train runs half-way _down_-hill, and
that gives it force enough to run the _other_ half _up_-hill STOP Thank you STOP I understand that perfectly, said Lady Muriel STOP But the
velocity, in the _middle_ of the tunnel, must be something _fearful_ STOP Mein Herr was evidently much gratified at the intelligent interest
Lady Muriel took in his remarks STOP At every moment the old man seemed to
grow more chatty and more fluent STOP You would like to know our methods of
_driving_ STOP he smilingly enquired STOP To us, a run-away horse is of no
import at all STOP Lady Muriel slightly shuddered STOP To _us_ it is a very real danger, she
said STOP That is because your carriage is wholly _behind_ your horse STOP Your horse
runs STOP Your carriage follows STOP Perhaps your horse has the bit in his
teeth STOP Who shall stop him STOP You fly, ever faster and faster STOP Finally
comes the inevitable upset STOP But suppose _your_ horse manages to get the bit in his teeth STOP No matter STOP We would not concern ourselves STOP Our horse is harnessed in
the very centre of our carriage STOP Two wheels are in front of him, and two
behind STOP To the roof is attached one end of a broad belt STOP This goes under
the horses body, and the other end is attached to a leetlewhat you
call a windlass, I think STOP The horse takes the bit in his teeth STOP He
runs away STOP We are flying at ten miles an hour STOP We turn our little
windlass, five turns, six turns, seven turns, andpoof STOP Our horse is off
the ground STOP _Now_ let him gallop in the air, as much as he pleases: our
_carriage_ stands still STOP We sit round him, and watch him till he is
tired STOP Then we let him down STOP Our horse is glad, very much glad, when his
feet once more touch the ground STOP Capital STOP said the Earl, who had been listening attentively STOP Are there
any other peculiarities in your carriages STOP In the _wheels_, sometimes, my Lord STOP For your health, _you_ go to sea:
to be pitched, to be rolled, occasionally to be drowned STOP _We_ do all
that on land: we are pitched, as you; we are rolled, as you; but
_drowned_, no STOP There is no water STOP What are the wheels like, then STOP They are _oval_, my Lord STOP Therefore the carriages rise and fall STOP Yes, and pitch the carriage backwards and forwards: but how do they
make it _roll_ STOP They do not match, my Lord STOP The _end_ of one wheel answers to the
_side_ of the opposite wheel STOP So first one side of the carriage rises,
then the other STOP And it pitches all the while STOP Ah, you must be a good
sailor, to drive in our boat-carriages STOP I can easily believe it, said the Earl STOP Mein Herr rose to his feet STOP I must leave you now, Miladi, he said,
consulting his watch STOP I have another engagement STOP I only wish we had stored up some extra time STOP Lady Muriel said, as she
shook hands with him STOP Then we could have kept you a little longer STOP In _that_ case I would gladly stay, replied Mein Herr STOP As it isI
fear I must say good-bye STOP Where did you first meet him STOP I asked Lady Muriel, when Mein Herr had
left us STOP And where does he live STOP And what is his real name STOP We firstmethim she musingly replied, really, I cant remember
_where_ STOP And Ive no idea where he lives STOP And I never heard any other
name STOP Its very curious STOP It never occurred to me before to consider what
a mystery he is STOP I hope we shall meet again, I said: he interests me very much STOP He will be at our farewell-party, this day fortnight, said the Earl STOP Of course you will come STOP Muriel is anxious to gather all our friends
around us once more, before we leave the place STOP And then he explained to meas Lady Muriel had left us togetherthat he
was so anxious to get his daughter away from a place full of so many
painful memories connected with the now-canceled engagement with Major
Lindon, that they had arranged to have the wedding in a months time,
after which Arthur and his wife were to go on a foreign tour STOP Dont forget Tuesday week STOP he said as we shook hands at parting STOP I
only wish you could bring with you those charming children, that you
introduced to us in the summer STOP Talk of the mystery of Mein Herr STOP Thats
_nothing_ to the mystery that seems to attend _them_ STOP I shall never
forget those marvellous flowers STOP I will bring them if I possibly can, I said STOP But how to _fulfil_ such
a promise, I mused to myself on my way back to our lodgings, was a
problem entirely beyond my skill STOP  STOP IN A SHADY PLACE STOP The ten days glided swiftly away: and, the day before the great party
was to take place, Arthur proposed that we should stroll down to the
Hall, in time for afternoon-tea STOP Hadnt you better go _alone_ STOP I suggested STOP Surely _I_ shall be very
much _de trop_ STOP Well, itll be a kind of _experiment_, he said STOP _Fiat experimentum in
corpore vili!_ he added, with a graceful bow of mock politeness towards
the unfortunate victim STOP You see I shall have to bear the sight,
to-morrow night, of my lady-love making herself agreable to everybody
_except_ the right person, and I shall bear the agony all the better if
we have a dress-rehearsal beforehand STOP _My_ part in the play being, apparently, that of the sample _wrong_
person STOP Well, no, Arthur said musingly, as we set forth: theres no such part
in a regular company STOP Heavy Father STOP _That_ wont do: thats filled
already STOP Singing Chambermaid STOP Well, the First Lady doubles _that_
part STOP Comic Old Man STOP Youre not comic enough STOP After all, Im afraid
theres no part for you but the Well-dressed Villain: only, with a
critical side-glance, Im a _leetle_ uncertain about the dress STOP We found Lady Muriel alone, the Earl having gone out to make a call, and
at once resumed old terms of intimacy, in the shady arbour where the
tea-things seemed to be always waiting STOP The only novelty in the
arrangements (one which Lady Muriel seemed to regard as _entirely_ a
matter of course), was that two of the chairs were placed _quite_ close
together, side by side STOP Strange to say, _I_ was not invited to occupy
_either_ of them STOP We have been arranging, as we came along, about letter-writing, Arthur
began STOP He will want to know how were enjoying our Swiss tour: and of
course we must pretend we _are_ STOP Of course, she meekly assented STOP And the skeleton-in-the-cupboard I suggested STOP is always a difficulty, she quickly put in, when youre traveling
about, and when there are no cupboards in the hotels STOP However, _ours_ is
a _very_ portable one; and will be neatly packed, in a nice leather
case

But please dont think about _writing_, I said, when youve anything
more attractive on hand STOP I delight in _reading_ letters, but I know well
how tiring it is to _write_ them STOP It _is_, sometimes, Arthur assented STOP For instance, when youre very
shy of the person you have to write to STOP Does that show itself in the _letter_ STOP Lady Muriel enquired STOP Of
course, when I hear any one _talking__you_, for instanceI can see how
_desperately_ shy he is STOP But can you see that in a _letter_ STOP Well, of course, when you hear any one talk _fluently__you_, for
instanceyou can see how desperately _un_-shy she isnot to say saucy STOP But the shyest and most intermittent talker must _seem_ fluent in
letter-writing STOP He may have taken half-an-hour to _compose_ his second
sentence; but there it is, close after the first STOP Then letters dont express all that they _might_ express STOP Thats merely because our system of letter-writing is incomplete STOP A shy
writer _ought_ to be able to show that he is so STOP Why shouldnt he make
_pauses_ in writing, just as he would do in speaking STOP He might leave
blank spacessay half a page at a time STOP And a _very_ shy girlif there
_is_ such a thingmight write a sentence on the _first_ sheet of her
letterthen put in a couple of _blank_ sheetsthen a sentence on the
_fourth_ sheet: and so on STOP I quite foresee that _we_I mean this clever little boy and myself
Lady Muriel said to me, evidently with the kind wish to bring me into
the conversation, are going to become famousof course all our
inventions are common property nowfor a new Code of Rules for
Letter-writing STOP Please invent some more, little boy STOP Well, another thing _greatly_ needed, little girl, is some way of
expressing that we _dont_ mean anything STOP Explain yourself, little boy STOP Surely _you_ can find no difficulty in
expressing a _total_ absence of meaning STOP I mean that you should be able, when you _dont_ mean a thing to be
taken seriously, to express that wish STOP For human nature is so
constituted that whatever you write seriously is taken as a joke, and
whatever you mean as a joke is taken seriously STOP At any rate, it is so in
writing to a _lady_ STOP Ah STOP youre not used to writing to ladies STOP Lady Muriel remarked,
leaning back in her chair, and gazing thoughtfully into the sky STOP You
should try STOP Very good, said Arthur STOP How many ladies may I begin writing to STOP As
many as I can count on the fingers of both hands STOP As many as you can count on the _thumbs_ of _one_ hand STOP his lady-love
replied with much severity STOP What a _very_ naughty little boy he is STOP _Isnt_ he STOP (with an appealing glance at me) STOP Hes a little fractious, I said STOP Perhaps hes cutting a tooth STOP While
to myself I said How _exactly_ like Sylvie talking to Bruno STOP He wants his tea STOP (The naughty little boy volunteered the
information. STOP Hes getting very tired, at the mere _prospect_ of the
great party to-morrow STOP Then he shall have a good rest beforehand STOP she soothingly replied STOP The tea isnt made yet STOP Come, little boy, lean well back in your chair,
and think about nothingor about _me_, whichever you prefer STOP All the same, all the same STOP Arthur sleepily murmured, watching her
with loving eyes, as she moved her chair away to the tea table, and
began to make the tea STOP Then hell wait for his tea, like a good,
patient little boy STOP Shall I bring you the London Papers STOP said Lady Muriel STOP I saw them
lying on the table as I came out, but my father said there was nothing
in them, except that horrid murder-trial STOP (Society was just then
enjoying its daily thrill of excitement in studying the details of a
specially sensational murder in a thieves den in the East of London. STOP I have no appetite for horrors, Arthur replied STOP But I hope we have
learned the lesson they should teach usthough we are very apt to read
it backwards STOP [Illustration: I AM SITTING AT YOUR FEET]

You speak in riddles, said Lady Muriel STOP Please explain yourself STOP See
now, suiting the action to the word, I am sitting at your feet, just
as if you were a second Gamaliel STOP Thanks, no STOP (This was to me, who had
risen to bring her chair back to its former place. STOP Pray dont disturb
yourself STOP This tree and the grass make a very nice easy-chair STOP _What_ is
the lesson that one always reads wrong STOP Arthur was silent for a minute STOP I would like to be clear what it _is_ I
mean, he said, slowly and thoughtfully, before I say anything to
_you_because you _think_ about it STOP Anything approaching to a compliment was so unusual an utterance for
Arthur, that it brought a flush of pleasure to her cheek, as she replied
It is _you_, that give me the ideas to think about STOP Ones first thought, Arthur proceeded, in reading of anything
specially vile or barbarous, as done by a fellow-creature, is apt to be
that we see a new depth of Sin revealed _beneath_ us: and we seem to
gaze down into that abyss from some higher ground, far apart from it STOP I think I understand you now STOP You mean that one ought to thinknot
God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men arebut God, be merciful
to me also, who might be, but for Thy grace, a sinner as vile as he STOP No, said Arthur STOP I meant a great deal more than that STOP She looked up quickly, but checked herself, and waited in silence STOP One must begin further back, I think STOP Think of some other man, the same
age as this poor wretch STOP Look back to the time when they both began
lifebefore they had sense enough to know Right from Wrong STOP _Then_, at
any rate, they were equal in Gods sight STOP She nodded assent STOP We have, then, two distinct epochs at which we may contemplate the two
men whose lives we are comparing STOP At the first epoch they are, so far as
moral responsibility is concerned, on precisely the same footing: they
are alike incapable of doing right or wrong STOP At the second epoch the one
manI am taking an extreme case, for contrasthas won the esteem and
love of all around him: his character is stainless, and his name will be
held in honour hereafter: the other mans history is one unvaried record
of crime, and his life is at last forfeited to the outraged laws of his
country STOP Now what have been the causes, in each case, of each mans
condition being what it is at the second epoch STOP They are of two
kindsone acting from within, the other from without STOP These two kinds
need to be discussed separatelythat is, if I have not already tired you
with my prosing STOP On the contrary, said Lady Muriel, it is a special delight to me to
have a question discussed in this wayanalysed and arranged, so that one
can understand it STOP Some books, that profess to argue out a question, are
to me intolerably wearisome, simply because the ideas are all arranged
hap-hazarda sort of first come, first served STOP You are very encouraging, Arthur replied, with a pleased look STOP The
causes, acting from _within_, which make a mans character what it is at
any given moment, are his successive acts of volitionthat is, his acts
of choosing whether he will do this or that STOP We are to assume the existence of Free-Will STOP I said, in order to have
that point made quite clear STOP If not, was the quiet reply, _cadit quaestio_: and I have no more to
say STOP We _will_ assume it STOP the rest of the audiencethe majority, I may say,
looking at it from Arthurs point of viewimperiously proclaimed STOP The
orator proceeded STOP The causes, acting from _without_, are his surroundingswhat Mr.
Herbert Spencer calls his environment STOP Now the point I want to make
clear is this, that a man is responsible for his acts of choosing, but
_not_ responsible for his environment STOP Hence, if these two men make, on
some given occasion, when they are exposed to equal temptation, equal
efforts to resist and to choose the right, their condition, in the sight
of God, must be the same STOP If He is pleased in the one case, so will He
be in the other; if displeased in the one case, so also in the other STOP That is so, no doubt: I see it quite clearly, Lady Muriel put in STOP And yet, owing to their different environments, the one may win a great
victory over the temptation, while the other falls into some black abyss
of crime STOP But surely you would not say those men were equally guilty in the sight
of God STOP Either that, said Arthur, or else I must give up my belief in Gods
perfect justice STOP But let me put one more case, which will show my
meaning even more forcibly STOP Let the one man be in a high social
positionthe other, say, a common thief STOP Let the one be tempted to some
trivial act of unfair dealingsomething which he can do with the
absolute certainty that it will never be discoveredsomething which he
can with perfect ease forbear from doingand which he distinctly knows
to be a sin STOP Let the other be tempted to some terrible crimeas men
would consider itbut under an almost overwhelming pressure of
motivesof course not _quite_ overwhelming, as that would destroy all
responsibility STOP Now, in this case, let the second man make a _greater_
effort at resistance than the first STOP Also suppose _both_ to fall under
the temptationI say that the second man is, in Gods sight, _less_
guilty than the other STOP Lady Muriel drew a long breath STOP It upsets all ones ideas of Right and
Wrongjust at first STOP Why, in that dreadful murder-trial, you would say,
I suppose, that it was possible that the least guilty man in the Court
was the murderer, and that possibly the judge who tried him, by yielding
to the temptation of making one unfair remark, had committed a crime
outweighing the criminals whole career STOP Certainly I should, Arthur firmly replied STOP It sounds like a paradox,
I admit STOP But just think what a grievous sin it must be, in Gods sight,
to yield to some very slight temptation, which we could have resisted
with perfect ease, and to do it deliberately, and in the full light of
Gods Law STOP What penance can atone for a sin like _that_ STOP I cant reject your theory, I said STOP But how it seems to widen the
possible area of Sin in the world STOP Is that so STOP Lady Muriel anxiously enquired STOP Oh, not so, not so STOP was the eager reply STOP To me it seems to clear away
much of the cloud that hangs over the worlds history STOP When this view
first made itself clear to me, I remember walking out into the fields,
repeating to myself that line of Tennyson _There seemed no room for
sense of wrong!_ The thought, that perhaps the real guilt of the human
race was infinitely less than I fancied itthat the millions, whom I had
thought of as sunk in hopeless depths of sin, were perhaps, in Gods
sight, scarcely sinning at allwas more sweet than words can tell STOP Life
seemed more bright and beautiful, when once that thought had come STOP _A
livelier emerald twinkles in the grass, A purer sapphire melts into the
sea!_ His voice trembled as he concluded, and the tears stood in his
eyes STOP Lady Muriel shaded her face with her hand, and was silent for a minute STOP It is a beautiful thought, she said, looking up at last STOP Thank
youArthur, for putting it into my head STOP The Earl returned in time to join us at tea, and to give us the very
unwelcome tidings that a fever had broken out in the little harbour-town
that lay below usa fever of so malignant a type that, though it had
only appeared a day or two ago, there were already more than a dozen
down in it, two or three of whom were reported to be in imminent danger STOP In answer to the eager questions of Arthurwho of course took a deep
scientific interest in the matterhe could give very few _technical_
details, though he had met the local doctor STOP It appeared, however, that
it was an almost _new_ diseaseat least in _this_ century, though it
_might_ prove to be identical with the Plague recorded in
History_very_ infectious, and frightfully rapid in its action STOP It will
not, however, prevent our party to-morrow, he said in conclusion STOP None
of the guests belong to the infected district, which is, as you know,
exclusively peopled by fishermen: so you may come without any fear STOP Arthur was very silent, all the way back, and, on reaching our lodgings,
immediately plunged into medical studies, connected with the alarming
malady of whose arrival we had just heard STOP  STOP THE FAREWELL-PARTY STOP On the following day, Arthur and I reached the Hall in good time, as
only a few of the guestsit was to be a party of eighteenhad as yet
arrived; and these were talking with the Earl, leaving us the
opportunity of a few words apart with our hostess STOP Who is that _very_ learned-looking man with the large spectacles STOP Arthur enquired STOP I havent met him here before, have I STOP No, hes a new friend of ours, said Lady Muriel: a German, I believe STOP He _is_ such a dear old thing STOP And quite the most learned man I ever
metwith _one_ exception, of course STOP she added humbly, as Arthur drew
himself up with an air of offended dignity STOP And the young lady in blue, just beyond him, talking to that
foreign-looking man STOP Is _she_ learned, too STOP I dont know, said Lady Muriel STOP But Im told shes a wonderful
piano-forte-player STOP I hope youll hear her to-night STOP I asked that
foreigner to take her in, because _hes_ very musical, too STOP Hes a
French Count, I believe; and he sings _splendidly_ STOP Sciencemusicsingingyou have indeed got a complete party STOP said
Arthur STOP I feel quite a privileged person, meeting all these stars STOP I
_do_ love music STOP But the party isnt _quite_ complete STOP said Lady Muriel STOP You havent
brought us those two beautiful children, she went on, turning to me STOP He brought them here to tea, you know, one day last summer, again
addressing Arthur; and they _are_ such darlings STOP They are, _indeed_, I assented STOP But why havent you brought them with you STOP You promised my father you
_would_ STOP Im very sorry, I said; but really it was impossible to bring them
with me STOP Here I most certainly _meant_ to conclude the sentence: and it
was with a feeling of utter amazement, which I cannot adequately
describe, that I heard myself _going on speaking_ STOP but they are to
join me here in the course of the evening were the words, uttered in
_my_ voice, and seeming to come from _my_ lips STOP Im _so_ glad STOP Lady Muriel joyfully replied STOP I _shall_ enjoy
introducing them to some of my friends here STOP When do you expect them STOP I took refuge in silence STOP The only _honest_ reply would have been That
was not _my_ remark STOP _I_ didnt say it, and _it isnt true_ STOP But I had
not the moral courage to make such a confession STOP The character of a
lunatic is not, I believe, very difficult to _acquire_: but it is
amazingly difficult to _get rid of_: and it seemed quite certain that
any such speech as _that_ would _quite_ justify the issue of a writ _de
lunatico inquirendo_ STOP Lady Muriel evidently thought I had failed to hear her question, and
turned to Arthur with a remark on some other subject; and I had time to
recover from my shock of surpriseor to awake out of my momentary
eerie condition, whichever it was STOP When things around me seemed once more to be real, Arthur was saying
Im afraid theres no help for it: they _must_ be finite in number STOP I should be sorry to have to believe it, said Lady Muriel STOP Yet, when
one comes to think of it, there _are_ no new melodies, now-a-days STOP What
people talk of as the last new song always recalls to _me_ some tune
Ive known as a child STOP The day must comeif the world lasts long enough said Arthur, when
every possible tune will have been composedevery possible pun
perpetrated (Lady Muriel wrung her hands, like a tragedy-queen) and,
worse than that, every possible _book_ written STOP For the number of
_words_ is finite STOP Itll make very little difference to the _authors_, I suggested STOP Instead of saying _what_ book shall I write STOP an author will ask
himself _which_ book shall I write STOP A mere verbal distinction STOP Lady Muriel gave me an approving smile STOP But _lunatics_ would always
write new books, surely STOP she went on STOP They _couldnt_ write the sane
books over again STOP True, said Arthur STOP But _their_ books would come to an end, also STOP The
number of lunatic _books_ is as finite as the number of lunatics STOP And _that_ number is becoming greater every year, said a pompous man,
whom I recognised as the self-appointed showman on the day of the
picnic STOP So they say, replied Arthur STOP And, when ninety per cent STOP of us are
lunatics, (he seemed to be in a wildly nonsensical mood) the asylums
will be put to their proper use STOP And that is STOP the pompous man gravely enquired STOP _To shelter the sane!_ said Arthur STOP _We_ shall bar ourselves in STOP The
lunatics will have it all their own way, _outside_ STOP Theyll do it a
little queerly, no doubt STOP Railway-collisions will be always happening:
steamers always blowing up: most of the towns will be burnt down: most
of the ships sunk

And most of the men _killed_ STOP murmured the pompous man, who was
evidently hopelessly bewildered STOP Certainly, Arthur assented STOP Till at last there will be _fewer_
lunatics than sane men STOP Then _we_ come out: _they_ go in: and things
return to their normal condition STOP The pompous man frowned darkly, and bit his lip, and folded his arms,
vainly trying to think it out STOP He is _jesting_ STOP he muttered to himself
at last, in a tone of withering contempt, as he stalked away STOP By this time the other guests had arrived; and dinner was announced STOP Arthur of course took down Lady Muriel: and _I_ was pleased to find
myself seated at her other side, with a severe-looking old lady (whom I
had not met before, and whose name I had, as is usual in introductions,
entirely failed to catch, merely gathering that it sounded like a
compound-name) as my partner for the banquet STOP She appeared, however, to be acquainted with Arthur, and confided to me
in a low voice her opinion that he was a very argumentative young man STOP Arthur, for his part, seemed well inclined to show himself worthy of the
character she had given him, and, hearing her say I never take wine
with my soup STOP (this was _not_ a confidence to me, but was launched upon
Society, as a matter of general interest), he at once challenged a
combat by asking her _when_ would you say that property _commence_ in a
plate of soup STOP This is _my_ soup, she sternly replied: and what is before you is
_yours_ STOP No doubt, said Arthur: but _when_ did I begin to own it STOP Up to the
moment of its being put into the plate, it was the property of our host:
while being offered round the table, it was, let us say, held in trust
by the waiter: did it become mine when I accepted it STOP Or when it was
placed before me STOP Or when I took the first spoonful STOP He is a _very_ argumentative young man STOP was all the old lady would
say: but she said it audibly, this time, feeling that Society had a
right to know it STOP Arthur smiled mischievously STOP I shouldnt mind betting you a shilling,
he said, that the Eminent Barrister next you (It certainly _is_
possible to say words so as to make them begin with capitals! STOP cant
answer me STOP I _never_ bet, she sternly replied STOP Not even sixpenny points at _whist_ STOP _Never!_ she repeated STOP _Whist_ is innocent enough: but whist played
for _money_ STOP She shuddered STOP Arthur became serious again STOP Im afraid I cant take that view, he
said STOP I consider that the introduction of small stakes for card-playing
was one of the most _moral_ acts Society ever did, _as_ Society STOP How was it so STOP said Lady Muriel STOP Because it took Cards, once for all, out of the category of games at
which _cheating_ is possible STOP Look at the way Croquet is demoralising
Society STOP Ladies are beginning to cheat at it, terribly: and, if theyre
found out, they only laugh, and call it fun STOP But when theres _money_ at
stake, that is out of the question STOP The swindler is _not_ accepted as a
wit STOP When a man sits down to cards, and cheats his friends out of their
money, he doesnt get much _fun_ out of itunless he thinks it fun to be
kicked down stairs STOP If all gentlemen thought as badly of ladies as _you_ do, my neighbour
remarked with some bitterness, there would be very fewvery few STOP She
seemed doubtful how to end her sentence, but at last took honeymoons
as a safe word STOP On the contrary, said Arthur, the mischievous smile returning to his
face, if only people would adopt _my_ theory, the number of
honeymoonsquite of a new kindwould be greatly increased STOP May we hear about this new kind of honeymoon STOP said Lady Muriel STOP Let _X_ be the gentleman, Arthur began, in a slightly raised voice, as
he now found himself with an audience of _six_, including Mein Herr,
who was seated at the other side of my polynomial partner STOP Let _X_ be
the gentleman, and _Y_ the lady to whom he thinks of proposing STOP He
applies for an Experimental Honeymoon STOP It is granted STOP Forthwith the
young coupleaccompanied by the great-aunt of _Y_, to act as
chaperonestart for a months tour, during which they have many a
moonlight-walk, and many a _tete-a-tete_ conversation, and each can form
a more correct estimate of the others character, in four _weeks_, than
would have been possible in as many _years_, when meeting under the
ordinary restrictions of Society STOP And it is only after their _return_
that _X_ finally decides whether he will, or will not, put the momentous
question to _Y_ STOP In nine cases out of ten, the pompous man proclaimed, he would decide
to break it off STOP Then, in nine cases out of ten, Arthur rejoined, an unsuitable match
would be prevented, and _both_ parties saved from misery STOP The only really _unsuitable_ matches, the old lady remarked, are
those made without sufficient _Money_ STOP Love may come _afterwards_ STOP Money
is needed _to begin with_ STOP This remark was cast loose upon Society, as a sort of general challenge;
and, as such, it was at once accepted by several of those within
hearing: _Money_ became the key-note of the conversation for some time;
and a fitful echo of it was again heard, when the dessert had been
placed upon the table, the servants had left the room, and the Earl had
started the wine in its welcome progress round the table STOP Im very glad to see you keep up the old customs, I said to Lady
Muriel as I filled her glass STOP Its really delightful to experience,
once more, the peaceful feeling that comes over one when the waiters
have left the roomwhen one can converse without the feeling of being
overheard, and without having dishes constantly thrust over ones
shoulder STOP How much more sociable it is to be able to pour out the wine
for the ladies, and to hand the dishes to those who wish for them STOP In that case, kindly send those peaches down here, said a fat
red-faced man, who was seated beyond our pompous friend STOP Ive been
wishing for themdiagonallyfor some time STOP Yes, it _is_ a ghastly innovation, Lady Muriel replied, letting the
waiters carry round the wine at dessert STOP For one thing, they _always_
take it the wrong way roundwhich of course brings bad luck to
_everybody_ present STOP Better go the _wrong_ way than not go _at all_ STOP said our host STOP Would
you kindly help yourself STOP (This was to the fat red-faced man. STOP You are
not a teetotaler, I think STOP Indeed but I _am_ STOP he replied, as he pushed on the bottles STOP Nearly
twice as much money is spent in England on _Drink_, as on any other
article of food STOP Read this card STOP (What faddist ever goes about without
a pocketful of the appropriate literature? STOP The stripes of different
colours represent the amounts spent on various articles of food STOP Look at
the highest three STOP Money spent on butter and on cheese, thirty-five
millions: on bread, seventy millions: on _intoxicating liquors_, one
hundred and thirty-six millions STOP If I had my way, I would close every
public-house in the land STOP Look at that card, and read the motto STOP _Thats
where all the money goes to!_

Have you seen the _Anti-Teetotal Card_ STOP Arthur innocently enquired STOP No, Sir, I have not STOP the orator savagely replied STOP What is it like STOP Almost exactly like this one STOP The coloured stripes are the same STOP Only,
instead of the words Money spent on, it has Incomes derived from sale
of; and, instead of Thats where all the money goes to, its motto is
_Thats where all the money comes from!_

The red-faced man scowled, but evidently considered Arthur beneath his
notice STOP So Lady Muriel took up the cudgels STOP Do you hold the theory,
she enquired, that people can preach teetotalism more effectually by
being teetotalers themselves STOP Certainly I do STOP replied the red-faced man STOP Now, here is a case in
point, unfolding a newspaper-cutting: let me read you this letter from
a teetotaler STOP _To the Editor STOP Sir, I was once a moderate drinker, and
knew a man who drank to excess STOP I went to him STOP Give up this drink, I
said STOP It will ruin your health STOP You drink, he said: why shouldnt
I STOP Yes, I said, but I know when to leave off STOP He turned away from
me STOP You drink in your way, he said: let me drink in mine STOP Be off STOP Then I saw that, to do any good with him, I must forswear drink STOP From
that hour I havent touched a drop!_

There STOP What do you say to _that_ STOP He looked round triumphantly, while
the cutting was handed round for inspection STOP How very curious STOP exclaimed Arthur, when it had reached him STOP Did you
happen to see a letter, last week, about early rising STOP It was strangely
like this one STOP The red-faced mans curiosity was roused STOP Where did it appear STOP he
asked STOP Let me read it to you, said Arthur STOP He took some papers from his
pocket, opened one of them, and read as follows STOP _To the Editor STOP Sir, I
was once a moderate sleeper, and knew a man who slept to excess STOP I
pleaded with him STOP Give up this lying in bed, I said, It will ruin
your health STOP You go to bed, he said: why shouldnt I STOP Yes, I
said, but I know when to get up in the morning STOP He turned away from
me STOP You sleep in your way, he said: let me sleep in mine STOP Be off STOP Then I saw that to do any good with him, I must forswear sleep STOP From
that hour I havent been to bed!_

Arthur folded and pocketed his paper, and passed on the
newspaper-cutting STOP None of us dared to laugh, the red-faced man was
evidently so angry STOP Your parallel doesnt run on all fours STOP he
snarled STOP _Moderate_ drinkers never do so STOP Arthur quietly replied STOP Even the
stern old lady laughed at this STOP But it needs many other things to make a _perfect_ dinner STOP said Lady
Muriel, evidently anxious to change the subject STOP Mein Herr STOP What is
_your_ idea of a perfect dinner-party STOP The old man looked round smilingly, and his gigantic spectacles seemed
more gigantic than ever STOP A _perfect_ dinner-party STOP he repeated STOP First, it must be presided over by our present hostess STOP That, of _course_ STOP she gaily interposed STOP But what _else_, Mein Herr STOP I can but tell you what I have seen, said Mein Herr, in mine ownin
the country I have traveled in STOP He paused for a full minute, and gazed steadily at the ceilingwith so
dreamy an expression on his face, that I feared he was going off into a
reverie, which seemed to be his normal state STOP However, after a minute,
he suddenly began again STOP That which chiefly causes the failure of a dinner-party, is the
running-shortnot of meat, nor yet of drink, but of _conversation_ STOP In an _English_ dinner-party, I remarked, I have never known
_small-talk_ run short STOP Pardon me, Mein Herr respectfully replied, I did not say
small-talk STOP I said conversation STOP All such topics as the weather, or
politics, or local gossip, are unknown among us STOP They are either vapid
or controversial STOP What we need for _conversation_ is a topic of
_interest_ and of _novelty_ STOP To secure these things we have tried
various plansMoving-Pictures, Wild-Creatures, Moving-Guests, and a
Revolving-Humorist STOP But this last is only adapted to _small_ parties STOP Let us have it in four separate Chapters, please STOP said Lady Muriel,
who was evidently deeply interestedas, indeed, most of the party were,
by this time: and, all down the table, talk had ceased, and heads were
leaning forwards, eager to catch fragments of Mein Herrs oration STOP Chapter One STOP Moving-Pictures STOP was proclaimed in the silvery voice of
our hostess STOP The dining-table is shaped like a circular ring, Mein Herr began, in
low dreamy tones, which, however, were perfectly audible in the silence STOP The guests are seated at the inner side as well as the outer, having
ascended to their places by a winding-staircase, from the room below STOP Along the middle of the table runs a little railway; and there is an
endless train of trucks, worked round by machinery; and on each truck
there are two pictures, leaning back to back STOP The train makes two
circuits during dinner; and, when it has been _once_ round, the waiters
turn the pictures round in each truck, making them face the other way STOP Thus _every_ guest sees _every_ picture STOP He paused, and the silence seemed deader than ever STOP Lady Muriel looked
aghast STOP Really, if this goes on, she exclaimed, I shall have to drop
a pin STOP Oh, its _my_ fault, is it STOP (In answer to an appealing look from
Mein Herr. STOP I was forgetting my duty STOP Chapter Two STOP Wild-Creatures STOP We found the Moving-Pictures a _little_ monotonous, said Mein Herr STOP People didnt care to talk Art through a whole dinner; so we tried
Wild-Creatures STOP Among the flowers, which we laid (just as _you_ do)
about the table, were to be seen, here a mouse, there a beetle; here a
spider, (Lady Muriel shuddered) there a wasp; here a toad, there a
snake; (Father STOP said Lady Muriel, plaintively STOP Did you hear
_that_? STOP so we had plenty to talk about STOP And when you got stung the old lady began STOP They were all chained-up, dear Madam STOP And the old lady gave a satisfied nod STOP There was no silence to follow, _this_ time STOP Third Chapter STOP Lady
Muriel proclaimed at once, Moving-Guests STOP Even the Wild-Creatures proved monotonous, the orator proceeded STOP So
we left the guests to choose their own subjects; and, to avoid monotony,
we changed _them_ STOP We made the table of _two_ rings; and the inner ring
moved slowly round, all the time, along with the floor in the middle and
the inner row of guests STOP Thus _every_ inner guest was brought
face-to-face with _every_ outer guest STOP It was a little confusing,
sometimes, to have to _begin_ a story to one friend and _finish_ it to
another; but _every_ plan has its faults, you know STOP Fourth Chapter STOP Lady Muriel hastened to announce STOP The
Revolving-Humorist STOP For a _small_ party we found it an excellent plan to have a round
table, with a hole cut in the middle large enough to hold _one_ guest STOP Here we placed our _best_ talker STOP He revolved slowly, facing every other
guest in turn: and he told lively anecdotes the whole time STOP I shouldnt like it STOP murmured the pompous man STOP It would make me
giddy, revolving like that STOP I should decline to here it appeared to
dawn upon him that perhaps the assumption he was making was not
warranted by the circumstances: he took a hasty gulp of wine, and choked
himself STOP But Mein Herr had relapsed into reverie, and made no further remark STOP Lady Muriel gave the signal, and the ladies left the room STOP  STOP JABBERING AND JAM STOP When the last lady had disappeared, and the Earl, taking his place at
the head of the table, had issued the military order Gentlemen STOP Close
up the ranks, if you please!, and when, in obedience to his command, we
had gathered ourselves compactly round him, the pompous man gave a deep
sigh of relief, filled his glass to the brim, pushed on the wine, and
began one of his favorite orations STOP They are charming, no doubt STOP Charming, but very frivolous STOP They drag us down, so to speak, to a lower
level STOP They

Do not all pronouns require antecedent _nouns_ STOP the Earl gently
enquired STOP Pardon me, said the pompous man, with lofty condescension STOP I had
overlooked the noun STOP The ladies STOP We regret their absence STOP Yet we console
ourselves STOP _Thought is free._ With them, we are limited to _trivial_
topicsArt, Literature, Politics, and so forth STOP One can bear to discuss
_such_ paltry matters with a lady STOP But no man, in his senses (he
looked sternly round the table, as if defying contradiction) ever yet
discussed _WINE_ with a lady STOP He sipped his glass of port, leaned back
in his chair, and slowly raised it up to his eye, so as to look through
it at the lamp STOP The vintage, my Lord STOP he enquired, glancing at his
host STOP The Earl named the date STOP So I had supposed STOP But one likes to be certain STOP The _tint_ is, perhaps,
slightly pale STOP But the _body_ is unquestionable STOP And as for the
_bouquet_

Ah, that magic Bouquet STOP How vividly that single word recalled the scene STOP The little beggar-boy turning his somersault in the roadthe sweet
little crippled maiden in my armsthe mysterious evanescent
nurse-maidall rushed tumultuously into my mind, like the creatures of a
dream: and through this mental haze there still boomed on, like the
tolling of a bell, the solemn voice of the great connoisseur of _WINE_ STOP Even _his_ utterances had taken on themselves a strange and dream-like
form STOP No, he resumedand _why_ is it, I pause to ask, that, in taking
up the broken thread of a dialogue, one _always_ begins with this
cheerless monosyllable STOP After much anxious thought, I have come to the
conclusion that the object in view is the same as that of the schoolboy,
when the sum he is working has got into a hopeless muddle, and when in
despair he takes the sponge, washes it all out, and begins again STOP Just
in the same way the bewildered orator, by the simple process of denying
_everything_ that has been hitherto asserted, makes a clean sweep of the
whole discussion, and can start fair with a fresh theory STOP No, he
resumed: theres nothing like cherry-jam, after all STOP Thats what _I_
say STOP Not for _all_ qualities STOP an eager little man shrilly interposed STOP For
_richness_ of general tone I dont say that it _has_ a rival STOP But for
_delicacy_ of modulationfor what one may call the _harmonics_ of
flavourgive _me_ good old _raspberry_-jam STOP Allow me one word STOP The fat red-faced man, quite hoarse with
excitement, broke into the dialogue STOP Its too important a question to
be settled by Amateurs STOP I can give you the views of a
_Professional_perhaps the most experienced jam-taster now living STOP Why,
Ive known him fix the age of strawberry-jam, to a _day_and we all know
what a difficult jam it is to give a date toon a single tasting STOP Well,
I put to him the _very_ question you are discussing STOP His words were
_cherry_-jam is best, for mere _chiaroscuro_ of flavour:
_raspberry_-jam lends itself best to those resolved discords that linger
so lovingly on the tongue: but, for rapturous _utterness_ of saccharine
perfection, its _apricot-jam first and the rest nowhere_ STOP That was
well put, _wasnt_ it STOP Consummately put STOP shrieked the eager little man STOP I know your friend well, said the pompous man STOP As a jam-taster, he
has no rival STOP Yet I scarcely think

But here the discussion became general: and his words were lost in a
confused medley of names, every guest sounding the praises of his own
favorite jam STOP At length, through the din, our hosts voice made itself
heard STOP Let us join the ladies STOP These words seemed to recall me to
waking life; and I felt sure that, for the last few minutes, I had
relapsed into the eerie state STOP A strange dream STOP I said to myself as we trooped upstairs STOP Grown men
discussing, as seriously as if they were matters of life and death, the
hopelessly trivial details of mere _delicacies_, that appeal to no
higher human function than the nerves of the tongue and palate STOP What a
humiliating spectacle such a discussion would be in waking life STOP When, on our way to the drawing-room, I received from the housekeeper my
little friends, clad in the daintiest of evening costumes, and looking,
in the flush of expectant delight, more radiantly beautiful than I had
ever seen them before, I felt no shock of surprise, but accepted the
fact with the same unreasoning apathy with which one meets the events of
a dream, and was merely conscious of a vague anxiety as to how they
would acquit themselves in so novel a sceneforgetting that Court-life
in Outland was as good training as they could need for Society in the
more substantial world STOP It would be best, I thought, to introduce them as soon as possible to
some good-natured lady-guest, and I selected the young lady whose
piano-forte-playing had been so much talked of STOP I am sure you like
children, I said STOP May I introduce two little friends of mine STOP This is
Sylvieand this is Bruno STOP The young lady kissed Sylvie very graciously STOP She would have done the
same for _Bruno_, but he hastily drew back out of reach STOP Their faces
are new to me, she said STOP Where do you come from, my dear STOP I had not anticipated so inconvenient a question; and, fearing that it
might embarrass Sylvie, I answered for her STOP They come from some
distance STOP They are only here just for this one evening STOP How far have you come, dear STOP the young lady persisted STOP Sylvie looked puzzled STOP A mile or two, I _think_, she said doubtfully STOP A mile or _three_, said Bruno STOP You shouldnt say a mile or _three_, Sylvie corrected him STOP The young lady nodded approval STOP Sylvies quite right STOP It isnt usual to
say a mile or _three_ STOP It would be usualif we said it often enough, said Bruno STOP It was the young ladys turn to look puzzled now STOP Hes very quick, for
his age STOP she murmured STOP Youre not more than seven, are you, dear STOP she
added aloud STOP Im not so many as _that_, said Bruno STOP Im _one_ STOP Sylvies _one_ STOP Sylvie and me is _two_ STOP _Sylvie_ taught me to count STOP Oh, I wasnt _counting_ you, you know STOP the young lady laughingly
replied STOP Hasnt oo _learnt_ to count STOP said Bruno STOP The young lady bit her lip STOP Dear STOP What embarrassing questions he _does_
ask STOP she said in a half-audible aside STOP Bruno, you shouldnt STOP Sylvie said reprovingly STOP Shouldnt _what_ STOP said Bruno STOP You shouldnt askthat sort of questions STOP _What_ sort of questions STOP Bruno mischievously persisted STOP What _she_ told you not, Sylvie replied, with a shy glance at the
young lady, and losing all sense of grammar in her confusion STOP Oo cant pronounce it STOP Bruno triumphantly cried STOP And he turned to the
young lady, for sympathy in his victory STOP I _knewed_ she couldnt
pronounce umbrella-sting STOP The young lady thought it best to return to the arithmetical problem STOP When I asked if you were _seven_, you know, I didnt mean how many
_children_ STOP I meant how many _years_

Only got _two_ ears, said Bruno STOP Nobodys got _seven_ ears STOP And you belong to this little girl STOP the young lady continued,
skilfully evading the anatomical problem STOP No, I doosnt belong to _her_ STOP said Bruno STOP Sylvie belongs to _me_ STOP And he clasped his arms round her as he added She are my very mine STOP And, do you know, said the young lady, Ive a little sister at home,
exactly like _your_ sister STOP Im sure theyd love each other STOP Theyd be very extremely useful to each other, Bruno said,
thoughtfully STOP And they wouldnt want no looking-glasses to brush their
hair wiz STOP Why not, my child STOP Why, each one would do for the other ones looking-glass, a-course STOP cried Bruno STOP But here Lady Muriel, who had been standing by, listening to this
bewildering dialogue, interrupted it to ask if the young lady would
favour us with some music; and the children followed their new friend to
the piano STOP Arthur came and sat down by me STOP If rumour speaks truly, he whispered,
we are to have a real treat STOP And then, amid a breathless silence, the
performance began STOP She was one of those players whom Society talks of as brilliant, and
she dashed into the loveliest of Haydns Symphonies in a style that was
clearly the outcome of years of patient study under the best masters STOP At
first it seemed to be the perfection of piano-forte-playing; but in a
few minutes I began to ask myself, wearily, _What_ is it that is
wanting STOP _Why_ does one get no pleasure from it STOP Then I set myself to listen intently to every note; and the mystery
explained itself STOP There _was_ an almost-perfect mechanical
_correctness_and there was nothing else STOP False notes, of course, did
not occur: she knew the piece too well for _that_; but there was just
enough irregularity of _time_ to betray that the player had no real
ear for musicjust enough inarticulateness in the more elaborate
passages to show that she did not think her audience worth taking real
pains forjust enough mechanical monotony of accent to take all _soul_
out of the heavenly modulations she was profaningin short, it was
simply irritating; and, when she had rattled off the finale and had
struck the final chord as if, the instrument being now done with, it
didnt matter how many wires she broke, I could not even _affect_ to
join in the stereotyped Oh, _thank_ you STOP which was chorused around me STOP Lady Muriel joined us for a moment STOP Isnt it _beautiful_ STOP she
whispered, to Arthur, with a mischievous smile STOP No, it isnt STOP said Arthur STOP But the gentle sweetness of his face quite
neutralised the apparent rudeness of the reply STOP Such execution, you know STOP she persisted STOP Thats what she _deserves_, Arthur doggedly replied: but people are
so prejudiced against capital

Now youre beginning to talk nonsense STOP Lady Muriel cried STOP But you
_do_ like Music, dont you STOP You said so just now STOP Do I like _Music_ STOP the Doctor repeated softly to himself STOP My dear
Lady Muriel, there is Music and Music STOP Your question is painfully vague STOP You might as well ask Do you like _People_ STOP Lady Muriel bit her lip, frowned, and stamped with one tiny foot STOP As a
dramatic representation of ill-temper, it was distinctly _not_ a
success STOP However, it took in _one_ of her audience, and Bruno hastened
to interpose, as peacemaker in a rising quarrel, with the remark _I_
likes Peoples STOP Arthur laid a loving hand on the little curly head STOP What STOP _All_
Peoples STOP he enquired STOP Not _all_ Peoples, Bruno explained STOP Only but Sylvieand Lady
Murieland him (pointing to the Earl) and ooand oo STOP You shouldnt point at people, said Sylvie STOP Its very rude STOP In Brunos World, I said, there are only _four_ Peopleworth
mentioning STOP In Brunos World STOP Lady Muriel repeated thoughtfully STOP A bright and
flowery world STOP Where the grass is always green, where the breezes always
blow softly, and the rain-clouds never gather; where there are no wild
beasts, and no deserts

There _must_ be deserts, Arthur decisively remarked STOP At least if it
was _my_ ideal world STOP But what possible use is there in a _desert_ STOP said Lady Muriel STOP _Surely_ you would have no wilderness in your ideal world STOP Arthur smiled STOP But indeed I _would_ STOP he said STOP A wilderness would be
more necessary than a railway; and _far_ more conducive to general
happiness than church-bells STOP But what would you use it for STOP _To practise music in_, he replied STOP All the young ladies, that have
no ear for music, but insist on learning it, should be conveyed, every
morning, two or three miles into the wilderness STOP There each would find a
comfortable room provided for her, and also a cheap second-hand
piano-forte, on which she might play for hours, without adding one
needless pang to the sum of human misery STOP Lady Muriel glanced round in alarm, lest these barbarous sentiments
should be overheard STOP But the fair musician was at a safe distance STOP At
any rate you must allow that shes a sweet girl STOP she resumed STOP Oh, certainly STOP As sweet as _eau sucree_, if you chooseand nearly as
interesting STOP You are incorrigible STOP said Lady Muriel, and turned to me STOP I hope you
found Mrs. Mills an interesting companion STOP Oh, _thats_ her name, is it STOP I said STOP I fancied there was _more_ of
it STOP So there is: and it will be at your proper peril (whatever that may
mean) if you ever presume to address her as Mrs. Mills STOP She is Mrs.
ErnestAtkinsonMills STOP She is one of those would-be grandees, said Arthur, who think that,
by tacking on to their surname all their spare Christian-names, with
hyphens between, they can give it an aristocratic flavour STOP As if it
wasnt trouble enough to remember _one_ surname STOP By this time the room was getting crowded, as the guests, invited for
the evening-party, were beginning to arrive, and Lady Muriel had to
devote herself to the task of welcoming them, which she did with the
sweetest grace imaginable STOP Sylvie and Bruno stood by her, deeply
interested in the process STOP I hope you like my friends STOP she said to them STOP Specially my dear old
friend, Mein Herr (Whats become of him, I wonder STOP Oh, there he is STOP ),
that old gentleman in spectacles, with a long beard STOP Hes a grand old gentleman STOP Sylvie said, gazing admiringly at Mein
Herr, who had settled down in a corner, from which his mild eyes beamed
on us through a gigantic pair of spectacles STOP And what a lovely beard STOP What does he call his-self STOP Bruno whispered STOP He calls himself Mein Herr, Sylvie whispered in reply STOP Bruno shook his head impatiently STOP Thats what he calls his _hair_, not
his _self_, oo silly STOP He appealed to me STOP What doos he call his _self_,
Mister Sir STOP Thats the only name _I_ know of, I said STOP But he looks very lonely STOP Dont you pity his grey hairs STOP I pities his _self_, said Bruno, still harping on the misnomer; but I
doosnt pity his _hair_, one bit STOP His _hair_ cant feel STOP We met him this afternoon, said Sylvie STOP Wed been to see Nero, and
wed had _such_ fun with him, making him invisible again STOP And we saw
that nice old gentleman as we came back STOP Well, lets go and talk to him, and cheer him up a little, I said:
and perhaps we shall find out what he calls himself STOP  STOP THE MAN IN THE MOON STOP The children came willingly STOP With one of them on each side of me, I
approached the corner occupied by Mein Herr STOP You dont object to
_children_, I hope STOP I began STOP _Crabbed age and youth cannot live together!_ the old man cheerfully
replied, with a most genial smile STOP Now take a good look at me, my
children STOP You would guess me to be an _old_ man, wouldnt you STOP At first sight, though his face had reminded me so mysteriously of the
Professor, he had seemed to be decidedly a _younger_ man: but, when I
came to look into the wonderful depth of those large dreamy eyes, I
felt, with a strange sense of awe, that he was incalculably _older_: he
seemed to gaze at us out of some by-gone age, centuries away STOP [Illustration: MEIN HERRS FAIRY-FRIENDS]

I dont know if oore an _old_ man, Bruno answered, as the children,
won over by the gentle voice, crept a little closer to him STOP I thinks
oore _eighty-three_ STOP He is very exact STOP said Mein Herr STOP Is he anything like right STOP I said STOP There are reasons, Mein Herr gently replied, reasons which I am not
at liberty to explain, for not mentioning _definitely_ any Persons,
Places, or Dates STOP One remark only I will permit myself to makethat the
period of life, between the ages of a hundred-and-sixty-five and a
hundred-and-seventy-five, is a specially _safe_ one STOP How do you make that out STOP I said STOP Thus STOP You would consider swimming to be a very safe amusement, if you
scarcely ever heard of any one dying of it STOP Am I not right in thinking
that you never heard of any one dying between those two ages STOP I see what you mean, I said: but Im afraid you cant prove
_swimming_ to be safe, on the same principle STOP It is no uncommon thing to
hear of some one being _drowned_ STOP In _my_ country, said Mein Herr, no one is _ever_ drowned STOP Is there no water deep enough STOP Plenty STOP But we cant _sink_ STOP We are all _lighter than water_ STOP Let me
explain, he added, seeing my look of surprise STOP Suppose you desire a
race of _pigeons_ of a particular shape or colour, do you not select,
from year to year, those that are nearest to the shape or colour you
want, and keep those, and part with the others STOP We do, I replied STOP We call it Artificial Selection STOP Exactly so, said Mein Herr STOP Well, _we_ have practised that for some
centuriesconstantly selecting the _lightest_ people: so that, now,
_everybody_ is lighter than water STOP Then you never can be drowned at _sea_ STOP Never STOP It is only on the _land_for instance, when attending a play in
a theatrethat we are in such a danger STOP How can that happen at a _theatre_ STOP Our theatres are all _underground_ STOP Large tanks of water are placed
above STOP If a fire breaks out, the taps are turned, and in one minute the
theatre is flooded, up to the very roof STOP Thus the fire is extinguished STOP _And_ the audience, I presume STOP That is a minor matter, Mein Herr carelessly replied STOP But they have
the comfort of knowing that, whether drowned or not, they are all
_lighter than water_ STOP We have not yet reached the standard of making
people lighter than _air_: but we are _aiming_ at it; and, in another
thousand years or so

What doos oo do wiz the peoples thats too heavy STOP Bruno solemnly
enquired STOP We have applied the same process, Mein Herr continued, not noticing
Brunos question, to many other purposes STOP We have gone on selecting
_walking-sticks_always keeping those that walked _best_till we have
obtained some, that can walk by themselves STOP We have gone on selecting
_cotton-wool_, till we have got some lighter than air STOP Youve no idea
what a useful material it is STOP We call it Imponderal STOP What do you use it for STOP Well, chiefly for _packing_ articles, to go by Parcel-Post STOP It makes
them weigh _less than nothing_, you know STOP And how do the Post-Office people know what you have to pay STOP Thats the beauty of the new system STOP Mein Herr cried exultingly STOP They
pay _us_: we dont pay _them_ STOP Ive often got as much as five shillings
for sending a parcel STOP But doesnt your Government object STOP Well, they _do_ object, a little STOP They say it comes so expensive, in
the long run STOP But the things as clear as daylight, by their own rules STOP If I send a parcel, that weighs a pound _more_ than nothing, I _pay_
three-pence: so, of course, if it weighs a pound _less_ than nothing, I
ought to _receive_ three-pence STOP It is _indeed_ a useful article STOP I said STOP Yet even Imponderal has its disadvantages, he resumed STOP I bought
some, a few days ago, and put it into my _hat_, to carry it home, and
the hat simply floated away STOP Had oo some of that funny stuff in oor hat _today_ STOP Bruno enquired STOP Sylvie and me saw oo in the road, and oor hat were ever so high up STOP Werent it, Sylvie STOP No, that was quite another thing STOP said Mein Herr STOP There was a drop or
two of rain falling: so I put my hat on the top of my stickas an
umbrella, you know STOP As I came along the road, he continued, turning to
me, I was overtaken by

a shower of rain STOP said Bruno STOP Well, it _looked_ more like the tail of a dog, Mein Herr replied STOP It
was the most curious thing STOP Something rubbed affectionately against my
knee STOP And I looked down STOP And I could see _nothing_ STOP Only, about a yard
off, there was a dogs tail, wagging, all by itself STOP Oh, _Sylvie_ STOP Bruno murmured reproachfully STOP Oo didnt finish making
him visible STOP Im _so_ sorry STOP Sylvie said, looking very penitent STOP I meant to rub it
along his back, but we were in such a hurry STOP Well go and finish him
tomorrow STOP Poor thing STOP Perhaps hell get no supper tonight STOP _Course_ he wont STOP said Bruno STOP Nobody never gives bones to a dogs
tail STOP Mein Herr looked from one to the other in blank astonishment STOP I do not
understand you, he said STOP I had lost my way, and I was consulting a
pocket-map, and somehow I had dropped one of my gloves, and this
invisible _Something_, that had rubbed against my knee, actually brought
it back to me STOP Course he did STOP said Bruno STOP Hes _welly_ fond of fetching things STOP Mein Herr looked so thoroughly bewildered that I thought it best to
change the subject STOP What a useful thing a pocket-map is STOP I remarked STOP Thats another thing weve learned from _your_ Nation, said Mein Herr,
map-making STOP But weve carried it much further than _you_ STOP What do you
consider the _largest_ map that would be really useful STOP About six inches to the mile STOP Only _six inches_ STOP exclaimed Mein Herr STOP We very soon got to six
_yards_ to the mile STOP Then we tried a _hundred_ yards to the mile STOP And
then came the grandest idea of all STOP We actually made a map of the
country, on the scale of _a mile to the mile_ STOP Have you used it much STOP I enquired STOP It has never been spread out, yet, said Mein Herr: the farmers
objected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the
sunlight STOP So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure
you it does nearly as well STOP Now let me ask you _another_ question STOP What
is the smallest _world_ you would care to inhabit STOP _I_ know STOP cried Bruno, who was listening intently STOP Id like a little
teeny-tiny world, just big enough for Sylvie and me STOP Then you would have to stand on opposite sides of it, said Mein Herr STOP And so you would never see your sister _at all_ STOP And Id have no _lessons_, said Bruno STOP You dont mean to say youve been trying experiments in _that_
direction STOP I said STOP Well, not _experiments_ exactly STOP We do not profess to _construct_
planets STOP But a scientific friend of mine, who has made several
balloon-voyages, assures me he has visited a planet so small that he
could walk right round it in twenty minutes STOP There had been a great
battle, just before his visit, which had ended rather oddly: the
vanquished army ran away at full speed, and in a very few minutes found
themselves face-to-face with the victorious army, who were marching home
again, and who were so frightened at finding themselves between _two_
armies, that they surrendered at once STOP Of course that lost them the
battle, though, as a matter of fact, they had killed _all_ the soldiers
on the other side STOP Killed soldiers _cant_ run away, Bruno thoughtfully remarked STOP Killed is a technical word, replied Mein Herr STOP In the little planet
I speak of, the bullets were made of soft black stuff, which marked
everything it touched STOP So, after a battle, all you had to do was to
count how many soldiers on each side were killedthat means marked on
the _back_, for marks in _front_ didnt count STOP Then you couldnt kill any, unless they ran away STOP I said STOP My scientific friend found out a better plan than _that_ STOP He pointed
out that, if only the bullets were sent _the other way round the world_,
they would hit the enemy in the _back_ STOP After that, the _worst_ marksmen
were considered the _best_ soldiers; and _the very worst of all_ always
got First Prize STOP And how did you decide which was _the very worst of all_ STOP Easily STOP The _best_ possible shooting is, you know, to hit what is
exactly in _front_ of you: so of course the _worst_ possible is to hit
what is exactly _behind_ you STOP They were strange people in that little planet STOP I said STOP They were indeed STOP Perhaps their method of _government_ was the
strangest of all STOP In _this_ planet, I am told, a Nation consists of a
number of Subjects, and one King: but, in the little planet I speak of,
it consisted of a number of _Kings_, and one _Subject_ STOP You say you are told what happens in _this_ planet, I said STOP May I
venture to guess that you yourself are a visitor from some _other_
planet STOP Bruno clapped his hands in his excitement STOP Is oo the Man-in-the-Moon STOP he cried STOP Mein Herr looked uneasy STOP I am _not_ in the Moon, my child, he said
evasively STOP To return to what I was saying STOP I think _that_ method of
government ought to answer _well_ STOP You see, the Kings would be sure to
make Laws contradicting each other: so the Subject could never be
punished, because, _whatever_ he did, hed be obeying _some_ Law STOP And, whatever he did, hed be _dis_obeying _some_ Law STOP cried Bruno STOP So hed _always_ be punished STOP Lady Muriel was passing at the moment, and caught the last word STOP Nobodys going to be punished _here_ STOP she said, taking Bruno in her
arms STOP This is Liberty-Hall STOP Would you lend me the children for a
minute STOP The children desert us, you see, I said to Mein Herr, as she carried
them off: so we old folk must keep each other company STOP The old man sighed STOP Ah, well STOP Were old folk _now_; and yet I was a
child myself, onceat least I fancy so STOP It _did_ seem a rather unlikely fancy, I could not help owning to
myselflooking at the shaggy white hair, and the long beardthat he
could _ever_ have been a child STOP You are fond of young people STOP I said STOP Young _men_, he replied STOP Not of _children_ exactly STOP I used to teach
young menmany a year agoin my dear old University STOP I didnt quite catch its _name_ STOP I hinted STOP I did not name it, the old man replied mildly STOP Nor would you know the
name if I did STOP Strange tales I could tell you of all the changes I have
witnessed there STOP But it would weary you, I fear STOP No, _indeed_ STOP I said STOP Pray go on STOP What kind of changes STOP But the old man seemed to be more in a humour for questions than for
answers STOP Tell me, he said, laying his hand impressively on my arm,
tell me something STOP For I am a stranger in your land, and I know little
of _your_ modes of education: yet something tells me _we_ are further on
than _you_ in the eternal cycle of changeand that many a theory _we_
have tried and found to fail, _you_ also will try, with a wilder
enthusiasm: you also will find to fail, with a bitterer despair STOP It was strange to see how, as he talked, and his words flowed more and
more freely, with a certain rhythmic eloquence, his features seemed to
glow with an inner light, and the whole man seemed to be transformed, as
if he had grown fifty years younger in a moment of time STOP  STOP FAIRY-MUSIC STOP The silence that ensued was broken by the voice of the musical young
lady, who had seated herself near us, and was conversing with one of the
newly-arrived guests STOP Well STOP she said in a tone of scornful surprise STOP We _are_ to have something new in the way of music, it appears STOP I looked round for an explanation, and was nearly as much astonished as
the speaker herself: it was _Sylvie_ whom Lady Muriel was leading to the
piano STOP Do try it, my darling STOP she was saying STOP Im sure you can play very
nicely STOP Sylvie looked round at me, with tears in her eyes STOP I tried to give her
an encouraging smile, but it was evidently a great strain on the nerves
of a child so wholly unused to be made an exhibition of, and she was
frightened and unhappy STOP Yet here came out the perfect sweetness of her
disposition: I could see that she was resolved to forget herself, and do
her best to give pleasure to Lady Muriel and her friends STOP She seated
herself at the instrument, and began instantly STOP Time and expression, so
far as one could judge, were perfect: but her touch was one of such
extraordinary lightness that it was at first scarcely possible, through
the hum of conversation which still continued, to catch a note of what
she was playing STOP But in a minute the hum had died away into absolute silence, and we all
sat, entranced and breathless, to listen to such heavenly music as none
then present could ever forget STOP Hardly touching the notes at first, she played a sort of introduction in
a minor keylike an embodied twilight; one felt as though the lights
were growing dim, and a mist were creeping through the room STOP Then there
flashed through the gathering gloom the first few notes of a melody so
lovely, so delicate, that one held ones breath, fearful to lose a
single note of it STOP Ever and again the music dropped into the pathetic
minor key with which it had begun, and, each time that the melody forced
its way, so to speak, through the enshrouding gloom into the light of
day, it was more entrancing, more magically sweet STOP Under the airy touch
of the child, the instrument actually seemed to _warble_, like a bird STOP _Rise up, my love, my fair one_, it seemed to sing, _and come away STOP For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers
appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come!_ One
could fancy one heard the tinkle of the last few drops, shaken from the
trees by a passing gustthat one saw the first glittering rays of the
sun, breaking through the clouds STOP The Count hurried across the room in great excitement STOP I _cannot_
remember myself, he exclaimed, of the name of this so charming an air STOP It is of an opera, most surely STOP Yet not even will the _opera_ remind his
name to me STOP What you call him, dear child STOP [Illustration: HOW CALL YOU THE OPERA? STOP Sylvie looked round at him with a rapt expression of face STOP She had
ceased playing, but her fingers still wandered fitfully over the keys STOP All fear and shyness had quite passed away now, and nothing remained but
the pure joy of the music that had thrilled our hearts STOP The title of it STOP the Count repeated impatiently STOP How call you the
opera STOP I dont know what an opera _is_, Sylvie half-whispered STOP How, then, call you the _air_ STOP I dont know any name for it, Sylvie replied, as she rose from the
instrument STOP But this is marvellous STOP exclaimed the Count, following the child, and
addressing himself to me, as if I were the proprietor of this musical
prodigy, and so _must_ know the origin of her music STOP You have heard her
play this, soonerI would say before this occasion STOP How call you the
air STOP I shook my head; but was saved from more questions by Lady Muriel, who
came up to petition the Count for a song STOP The Count spread out his hands apologetically, and ducked his head STOP But, Milady, I have already respectedI would say prospectedall your
songs; and there shall be none fitted to my voice STOP They are not for
basso voices STOP Wont you look at them again STOP Lady Muriel implored STOP Lets help him STOP Bruno whispered to Sylvie STOP Lets get him_you_ know STOP Sylvie nodded STOP Shall _we_ look for a song for you STOP she said sweetly to
the Count STOP Mais _oui_ STOP the little man exclaimed STOP Of course we may STOP said Bruno, while, each taking a hand of the
delighted Count, they led him to the music-stand STOP There is still hope STOP said Lady Muriel over her shoulder, as she
followed them STOP I turned to Mein Herr, hoping to resume our interrupted conversation STOP You were remarking I began: but at this moment Sylvie came to call
Bruno, who had returned to my side, looking unusually serious STOP _Do_
come, Bruno STOP she entreated STOP You know weve nearly found it STOP Then, in
a whisper, The lockets in my _hand_, now STOP I couldnt get it out while
they were looking STOP But Bruno drew back STOP The man called me names, he said with dignity STOP What names STOP I enquired with some curiosity STOP I asked him, said Bruno, which sort of song he liked STOP And he said
_A_ song of _a_ man, not of _a_ lady STOP And I said Shall Sylvie and me
find you the song of Mister Tottles STOP And he said Wait, eel STOP And Im
_not_ an eel, oo know STOP Im _sure_ he didnt mean it STOP Sylvie said earnestly STOP Its something
Frenchyou know he cant talk English so well as

Bruno relented visibly STOP Course he knows no better, if hes Flench STOP Flenchmen _never_ can speak English so goodly as _us_ STOP And Sylvie led
him away, a willing captive STOP Nice children STOP said the old man, taking off his spectacles and rubbing
them carefully STOP Then he put them on again, and watched with an approving
smile, while the children tossed over the heap of music, and we just
caught Sylvies reproving words, Were _not_ making hay, Bruno STOP This has been a long interruption to our conversation, I said STOP Pray
let us go on STOP Willingly STOP replied the gentle old man STOP I was much interested in what you He paused a moment, and passed his
hand uneasily across his brow STOP One forgets, he murmured STOP What was I
saying STOP Oh STOP Something you were to tell me STOP Yes STOP Which of your teachers
do you value the most highly, those whose words are easily understood,
or those who puzzle you at every turn STOP I felt obliged to admit that we generally admired most the teachers we
couldnt quite understand STOP Just so, said Mein Herr STOP Thats the way it begins STOP Well, _we_ were at
that stage some eighty years agoor was it ninety STOP Our favourite teacher
got more obscure every year; and every year we admired him morejust as
_your_ Art-fanciers call _mist_ the fairest feature in a landscape, and
admire a view with frantic delight when they can see nothing STOP Now Ill
tell you how it ended STOP It was Moral Philosophy that our idol lectured
on STOP Well, his pupils couldnt make head or tail of it, but they got it
all by heart; and, when Examination-time came, they wrote it down; and
the Examiners said Beautiful STOP What depth STOP But what good was it to the young men _afterwards_ STOP Why, dont you see STOP replied Mein Herr STOP _They_ became teachers in
their turn, and _they_ said all these things over again; and _their_
pupils wrote it all down; and the Examiners accepted it; and nobody had
the ghost of an idea what it all meant STOP And how did it end STOP It ended this way STOP We woke up one fine day, and found there was no one
in the place that knew _anything_ about Moral Philosophy STOP So we
abolished it, teachers, classes, examiners, and all STOP And if any one
wanted to learn anything about it, he had to make it out for himself;
and after another twenty years or so there were several men that really
knew something about it STOP Now tell me another thing STOP How long do you
teach a youth before you examine him, in your Universities STOP I told him, three or four years STOP Just so, just what _we_ did STOP he exclaimed STOP We taught em a bit, and,
just as they were beginning to take it in, we took it all out again STOP We
pumped our wells dry before they were a quarter fullwe stripped our
orchards while the apples were still in blossomwe applied the severe
logic of arithmetic to our chickens, while peacefully slumbering in
their shells STOP Doubtless its the early bird that picks up the wormbut
if the bird gets up so outrageously early that the worm is still deep
underground, what _then_ is its chance of a breakfast STOP Not much, I admitted STOP Now see how that works STOP he went on eagerly STOP If you want to pump your
wells so soonand I suppose you tell me that is what you _must_ do STOP We must, I said STOP In an over-crowded country like this, nothing but
Competitive Examinations

Mein Herr threw up his hands wildly STOP What, _again_ STOP he cried STOP I
thought it was dead, fifty years ago STOP Oh this Upas tree of Competitive
Examinations STOP Beneath whose deadly shade all the original genius, all
the exhaustive research, all the untiring life-long diligence by which
our fore-fathers have so advanced human knowledge, must slowly but
surely wither away, and give place to a system of Cookery, in which the
human mind is a sausage, and all we ask is, how much indigestible stuff
can be crammed into it STOP Always, after these bursts of eloquence, he seemed to forget himself for
a moment, and only to hold on to the thread of thought by some single
word STOP Yes, _crammed_, he repeated STOP We went through all that stage of
the diseasehad it bad, I warrant you STOP Of course, as the Examination was
all in all, we tried to put in just what was wantedand the _great_
thing to aim at was, that the Candidate should know absolutely _nothing_
beyond the needs of the Examination STOP I dont say it was ever _quite_
achieved: but one of my own pupils (pardon an old mans egotism) came
very near it STOP After the Examination, he mentioned to me the few facts
which he knew but had _not_ been able to bring in, and I can assure you
they were trivial, Sir, absolutely trivial STOP I feebly expressed my surprise and delight STOP The old man bowed, with a gratified smile, and proceeded STOP At that time,
no one had hit on the much more rational plan of watching for the
individual scintillations of genius, and rewarding them as they
occurred STOP As it was, we made our unfortunate pupil into a Leyden-jar,
charged him up to the eyelidsthen applied the knob of a Competitive
Examination, and drew off one magnificent spark, which very often
cracked the jar STOP What mattered _that_ STOP We labeled it First Class
Spark, and put it away on the shelf STOP But the more rational system STOP I suggested STOP Ah, yes STOP _that_ came next STOP Instead of giving the whole reward of
learning in one lump, we used to pay for every good answer as it
occurred STOP How well I remember lecturing in those days, with a heap of
small coins at my elbow STOP It was A _very_ good answer, Mr. Jones STOP (that
meant a shilling, mostly) STOP Bravo, Mr. Robinson STOP (that meant
half-a-crown) STOP Now Ill tell you how _that_ worked STOP Not one single fact
would any of them take in, without a fee STOP And when a clever boy came up
from school, he got paid more for learning than we got paid for teaching
him STOP Then came the wildest craze of all STOP What, _another_ craze STOP I said STOP Its the last one, said the old man STOP I must have tired you out with
my long story STOP Each College wanted to get the clever boys: so we adopted
a system which we had heard was very popular in England: the Colleges
competed against each other, and the boys let themselves out to the
highest bidder STOP What geese we were STOP Why, they were bound to come to the
University _somehow_ STOP We neednt have paid em STOP And all our money went
in getting clever boys to come to one College rather than another STOP The
competition was so keen, that at last mere money-payments were not
enough STOP Any College, that wished to secure some specially clever young
man, had to waylay him at the Station, and hunt him through the streets STOP The first who touched him was allowed to have him STOP That hunting-down of the scholars, as they arrived, must have been a
curious business, I said STOP Could you give me some idea of what it was
like STOP Willingly STOP said the old man STOP I will describe to you the very last
Hunt that took place, before that form of Sport (for it was actually
reckoned among the _Sports_ of the day: we called it Cub-Hunting) was
finally abandoned STOP I witnessed it myself, as I happened to be passing by
at the moment, and was what we called in at the death STOP I can see it
now STOP he went on in an excited tone, gazing into vacancy with those
large dreamy eyes of his STOP It seems like yesterday; and yet it
happened He checked himself hastily, and the remaining words died
away into a whisper STOP [Illustration: SCHOLAR-HUNTING: THE PURSUED]

_How_ many years ago did you say STOP I asked, much interested in the
prospect of at last learning _some_ definite fact in his history STOP [Illustration: SCHOLAR-HUNTING: THE PURSUERS]

_Many_ years ago, he replied STOP The scene at the Railway-Station had
been (so they told me) one of wild excitement STOP Eight or nine Heads of
Colleges had assembled at the gates (no one was allowed inside), and the
Station-Master had drawn a line on the pavement, and insisted on their
all standing behind it STOP The gates were flung open STOP The young man darted
through them, and fled like lightning down the street, while the Heads
of Colleges actually _yelled_ with excitement on catching sight of him STOP The Proctor gave the word, in the old statutory form, _Semel!_ _Bis!_
_Ter!_ _Currite!_, and the Hunt began STOP Oh, it was a fine sight, believe
me STOP At the first corner he dropped his Greek Lexicon: further on, his
railway-rug: then various small articles: then his umbrella: lastly,
what I suppose he prized most, his hand-bag: but the game was up: the
spherical Principal ofof

Of _which_ College STOP I said STOP of _one_ of the Colleges, he resumed, had put into operation the
Theoryhis own discoveryof Accelerated Velocity, and captured him just
opposite to where I stood STOP I shall never forget that wild breathless
struggle STOP But it was soon over STOP Once in those great bony hands, escape
was impossible STOP May I ask why you speak of him as the _spherical_ Principal STOP I said STOP The epithet referred to his _shape_, which was a perfect _sphere_ STOP You
are aware that a bullet, another instance of a perfect sphere, when
falling in a perfectly straight line, moves with Accelerated Velocity STOP I bowed assent STOP Well, my spherical friend (as I am proud to call him) set himself to
investigate the _causes_ of this STOP He found them to be _three_ STOP One; that
it is a perfect _sphere_ STOP Two; that it moves in a _straight line_ STOP Three; that its direction is _not upwards_ STOP When these three conditions
are fulfilled, you get Accelerated Velocity STOP Hardly, I said: if you will excuse my differing from you STOP Suppose we
apply the theory to _horizontal_ motion STOP If a bullet is fired
_horizontally_, it

it does _not_ move in a _straight line_, he quietly finished my
sentence for me STOP I yield the point, I said STOP What did your friend do next STOP The next thing was to apply the theory, as you rightly suggest, to
_horizontal_ motion STOP But the moving body, ever tending to _fall_, needs
_constant support_, if it is to move in a true horizontal line STOP What,
then, he asked himself, will _give constant support to a moving
body_ STOP And his answer was _Human legs!_ _That_ was the discovery that
immortalised his name STOP His name being STOP I suggested STOP I had not mentioned it, was the gentle reply of my most unsatisfactory
informant STOP His next step was an obvious one STOP He took to a diet of
suet-dumplings, until his body had become a perfect sphere STOP _Then_ he
went out for his first experimental runwhich nearly cost him his life STOP How was _that_ STOP Well, you see, he had no idea of the _tremendous_ new Force in Nature
that he was calling into play STOP He began too fast STOP In a very few minutes
he found himself moving at a hundred miles an hour STOP And, if he had not
had the presence of mind to charge into the middle of a haystack (which
he scattered to the four winds) there can be no doubt that he would have
left the Planet he belonged to, and gone right away into Space STOP And how came that to be the _last_ of the Cub-Hunts STOP I enquired STOP Well, you see, it led to a rather scandalous dispute between two of the
Colleges STOP _Another_ Principal had laid his hand on the young man, so
nearly at the same moment as the _spherical_ one, that there was no
knowing which had touched him first STOP The dispute got into print, and did
us no credit, and, in short, Cub-Hunts came to an end STOP Now Ill tell you
what cured us of that wild craze of ours, the bidding against each
other, for the clever scholars, just as if they were articles to be sold
by auction STOP Just when the craze had reached its highest point, and when
one of the Colleges had actually advertised a Scholarship of one
thousand pounds _per annum_, one of our tourists brought us the
manuscript of an old African legendI happen to have a copy of it in my
pocket STOP Shall I translate it for you STOP Pray go on, I said, though I felt I was getting _very_ sleepy STOP  STOP WHAT TOTTLES MEANT STOP Mein Herr unrolled the manuscript, but, to my great surprise, instead of
_reading_ it, he began to _sing_ it, in a rich mellow voice that seemed
to ring through the room STOP One thousand pounds per annuum
  Is not so bad a figure, come STOP Cried Tottles STOP And I tell you, flat,
  A man may marry well on that STOP To say the Husband needs the Wife
  Is not the way to represent it STOP The crowning joy of Womans life
  Is _Man_ STOP said Tottles (and he meant it) STOP The blissful Honey-moon is past:
  The Pair have settled down at last:
  Mamma-in-law their home will share,
  And make their happiness her care STOP Your income is an ample one;
  Go it, my children STOP (And they went it) STOP I rayther think this kind of fun
  Wont last STOP said Tottles (and he meant it) STOP They took a little country-box
  A box at Covent Garden also:
  They lived a life of double-knocks,
  Acquaintances began to call so:
  Their London house was much the same
  (It took three hundred, clear, to rent it):
  Life is a very jolly game STOP Cried happy Tottles (and he meant it) STOP Contented with a frugal lot
  (He always used that phrase at Gunters),
  He bought a handy little yacht
  A dozen serviceable hunters
  The fishing of a Highland Loch
  A sailing-boat to circumvent it
  The sounding of that Gaelic och
  Beats _me_ STOP said Tottles (and he meant it) STOP Here, with one of those convulsive starts that wake one up in the very
act of dropping off to sleep, I became conscious that the deep musical
tones that thrilled me did _not_ belong to Mein Herr, but to the French
Count STOP The old man was still conning the manuscript STOP I _beg_ your pardon for keeping you waiting STOP he said STOP I was just
making sure that I knew the English for all the words STOP I am quite ready
now STOP And he read me the following Legend:

In a city that stands in the very centre of Africa, and is rarely
visited by the casual tourist, the people had always bought eggsa daily
necessary in a climate where egg-flip was the usual dietfrom a Merchant
who came to their gates once a week STOP And the people always bid wildly
against each other: so there was quite a lively auction every time the
Merchant came, and the last egg in his basket used to fetch the value of
two or three camels, or thereabouts STOP And eggs got dearer every week STOP And
still they drank their egg-flip, and wondered where all their money went
to STOP [Illustration: THE EGG-MERCHANT]

And there came a day when they put their heads together STOP And they
understood what donkeys they had been STOP And next day, when the Merchant came, only _one_ Man went forth STOP And he
said Oh, thou of the hook-nose and the goggle-eyes, thou of the
measureless beard, how much for that lot of eggs STOP And the Merchant answered him I _could_ let thee have that lot at ten
thousand piastres the dozen STOP And the Man chuckled inwardly, and said _Ten_ piastres the dozen I
offer thee, and no more, oh descendant of a distinguished grandfather STOP And the Merchant stroked his beard, and said Hum STOP I will await the
coming of thy friends, So he waited STOP And the Man waited with him STOP And
they waited both together STOP The manuscript breaks off here, said Mein Herr, as he rolled it up
again; but it was enough to open our eyes STOP We saw what simpletons we
had beenbuying our Scholars much as those ignorant savages bought their
eggsand the ruinous system was abandoned STOP If only we could have
abandoned, along with it, all the _other_ fashions we had borrowed from
you, instead of carrying them to their logical results STOP But it was not
to be STOP What ruined my country, and drove me from my home, was the
introductioninto the _Army_, of all placesof your theory of Political
Dichotomy STOP Shall I trouble you too much, I said, if I ask you to explain what
you mean by the Theory of Political Dichotomy STOP No trouble at all STOP was Mein Herrs most courteous reply STOP I quite
enjoy talking, when I get so good a listener STOP What started the thing,
with us, was the report brought to us, by one of our most eminent
statesmen, who had stayed some time in England, of the way affairs were
managed there STOP It was a political necessity (so he assured us, and we
believed him, though we had never discovered it till that moment) that
there should be _two_ Parties, in every affair and on every subject STOP In
_Politics_, the two Parties, which you had found it necessary to
institute, were called, he told us, Whigs and Tories STOP That must have been some time ago STOP I remarked STOP It _was_ some time ago, he admitted STOP And this was the way the affairs
of the British Nation were managed STOP (You will correct me if I
misrepresent it STOP I do but repeat what our traveler told us. STOP These two
Partieswhich were in chronic hostility to each othertook turns in
conducting the Government; and the Party, that happened _not_ to be in
power, was called the Opposition, I believe STOP That is the right name, I said STOP There have always been, so long as we
have had a Parliament at all, _two_ Parties, one in, and one out STOP Well, the function of the Ins (if I may so call them) was to do the
best they could for the national welfarein such things as making war or
peace, commercial treaties, and so forth STOP Undoubtedly, I said STOP And the function of the Outs was (so our traveller assured us, though
we were very incredulous at first) to _prevent_ the Ins from
succeeding in any of these things STOP To _criticize_ and to _amend_ their proceedings, I corrected him STOP It
would be _unpatriotic_ to _hinder_ the Government in doing what was for
the good of the Nation STOP We have always held a _Patriot_ to be the
greatest of heroes, and an _unpatriotic_ spirit to be one of the worst
of human ills STOP Excuse me for a moment, the old gentleman courteously replied, taking
out his pocket-book STOP I have a few memoranda here, of a correspondence I
had with our tourist, and, if you will allow me, Ill just refresh my
memoryalthough I quite agree with youit is, as you say, one of the
worst of human ills And, here Mein Herr began singing again:

  But oh, the worst of human ills
  (Poor Tottles found) are little bills STOP And, with no balance in the Bank,
  What wonder that his spirits sank STOP Still, as the money flowed away,
  He wondered how on earth she spent it STOP You cost me twenty pounds a day,
  _At least_ STOP cried Tottles (and he meant it) STOP She sighed STOP Those Drawing Rooms, you know STOP I really never thought about it:
  Mamma declared we ought to go
  We should be Nobodies without it STOP That diamond-circlet for my brow
  I quite believed that _she_ had sent it,
  Until the Bill came in just now
  _Viper_ STOP cried Tottles (and he meant it) STOP Poor Mrs. T. could bear no more,
  But fainted flat upon the floor STOP Mamma-in-law, with anguish wild,
  Seeks, all in vain, to rouse her child STOP Quick STOP Take this box of smelling-salts STOP Dont scold her, James, or youll repent it,
  Shes a _dear_ girl, with all her faults
  She _is_ STOP groaned Tottles (and he meant it) STOP I was a donkey, Tottles cried,
  To choose your daughter for my bride STOP Twas _you_ that bid us cut a dash STOP Tis _you_ have brought us to this smash STOP You dont suggest one single thing
  That can in any way prevent it
  Then whats the use of arguing STOP _Shut up!_ cried Tottles (and he meant it) STOP Once more I started into wakefulness, and realised that Mein Herr was
not the singer STOP He was still consulting his memoranda STOP It is exactly what my friend told me, he resumed, after conning over
various papers STOP _Unpatriotic_ is the very word I had used, in writing
to him, and _hinder_ is the very word he used in his reply STOP Allow me
to read you a portion of his letter:

  _I can assure you_, he writes, _that, unpatriotic as you may think
  it, the recognised function of the Opposition is to hinder, in every
  manner not forbidden by the Law, the action of the Government STOP This
  process is called Legitimate Obstruction: and the greatest triumph
  the Opposition can ever enjoy, is when they are able to point out
  that, owing to their Obstruction, the Government have failed in
  everything they have tried to do for the good of the Nation!_

Your friend has not put it _quite_ correctly, I said STOP The Opposition
would no doubt be glad to point out that the Government had failed
_through their own fault_; but _not_ that they had failed on account of
_Obstruction_ STOP You think so STOP he gently replied STOP Allow me now to read to you this
newspaper-cutting, which my friend enclosed in his letter STOP It is part of
the report of a public speech, made by a Statesman who was at the time a
member of the Opposition:

  _At the close of the Session, he thought they had no reason to be
  discontented with the fortunes of the campaign STOP They had routed the
  enemy at every point STOP But the pursuit must be continued STOP They had only
  to follow up a disordered and dispirited foe._

Now to what portion of your national history would you guess that the
speaker was referring STOP Really, the number of _successful_ wars we have waged during the last
century, I replied, with a glow of British pride, is _far_ too great
for me to guess, with any chance of success, _which_ it was we were then
engaged in STOP However, I will name _India_ as the most probable STOP The
Mutiny was no doubt, all but crushed, at the time that speech was made STOP What a fine, manly, _patriotic_ speech it must have been STOP I exclaimed
in an outburst of enthusiasm STOP You think so STOP he replied, in a tone of gentle pity STOP Yet my friend
tells me that the _disordered and dispirited foe_ simply meant the
Statesmen who happened to be in power at the moment; that the
_pursuit_ simply meant Obstruction; and that the words _they had
routed the enemy_ simply meant that the Opposition had succeeded in
hindering the Government from doing any of the work which the Nation had
empowered them to do STOP I thought it best to say nothing STOP It seemed queer to _us_, just at first, he resumed, after courteously
waiting a minute for me to speak: but, when once we had mastered the
idea, our respect for your Nation was so great that we carried it into
every department of life STOP It was _the beginning of the end_ with us STOP My country never held up its head again STOP And the poor old gentleman
sighed deeply STOP Let us change the subject, I said STOP Do not distress yourself, I beg STOP No, no STOP he said, with an effort to recover himself STOP I had rather
finish my story STOP The next step (after reducing our Government to
impotence, and putting a stop to all useful legislation, which did not
take us long to do) was to introduce what we called the glorious
British Principle of Dichotomy into _Agriculture_ STOP We persuaded many of
the well-to-do farmers to divide their staff of labourers into two
Parties, and to set them one against the other STOP They were called, like
our political Parties, the Ins and the Outs: the business of the
Ins was to do as much of ploughing, sowing, or whatever might be
needed, as they could manage in a day, and at night they were paid
according to the amount they had _done_: the business of the Outs was
to hinder them, and _they_ were paid for the amount they had _hindered_ STOP The farmers found they had to pay only _half_ as much wages as they did
before, and they didnt observe that the amount of work done was only a
_quarter_ as much as was done before: so they took it up quite
enthusiastically, _at first_ STOP And _afterwards_ STOP I enquired STOP Well, _afterwards_ they didnt like it quite so well STOP In a very short
time, things settled down into a regular routine STOP No work _at all_ was
done STOP So the Ins got no wages, and the Outs got full pay STOP And the
farmers never discovered, till most of them were ruined, that the
rascals had agreed to manage it so, and had shared the pay between them STOP While the thing lasted, there were funny sights to be seen STOP Why, Ive
often watched a ploughman, with two horses harnessed to the plough,
doing his best to get it _forwards_; while the opposition-ploughman,
with three donkeys harnessed at the _other_ end, was doing _his_ best to
get it _backwards_ STOP And the plough never moving an inch, _either_ way STOP But _we_ never did anything like _that_ STOP I exclaimed STOP Simply because you were less _logical_ than we were, replied Mein
Herr STOP There is _sometimes_ an advantage in being a donkExcuse me STOP No
_personal_ allusion intended STOP All this happened _long ago_, you know STOP Did the Dichotomy-Principle succeed in _any_ direction STOP I enquired STOP In _none_, Mein Herr candidly confessed STOP It had a _very_ short trial
in _Commerce_ STOP The shop-keepers _wouldnt_ take it up, after once trying
the plan of having half the attendants busy in folding up and carrying
away the goods which the other half were trying to spread out upon the
counters STOP They said the Public didnt like it STOP I dont wonder at it, I remarked STOP Well, we tried the British Principle for some years STOP And the end of
it all was His voice suddenly dropped, almost to a whisper; and large
tears began to roll down his cheeks STOP the end was that we got involved
in a war; and there was a great battle, in which we far out-numbered the
enemy STOP But what could one expect, when only _half_ of our soldiers were
fighting, and the other half pulling them back STOP It ended in a crushing
defeatan utter rout STOP This caused a Revolution; and most of the
Government were banished STOP I myself was accused of Treason, for having so
strongly advocated the British Principle STOP My property was all
forfeited, andandI was driven into exile STOP Now the mischiefs done,
they said, perhaps youll kindly leave the country STOP It nearly broke my
heart, but I had to go STOP The melancholy tone became a wail: the wail became a chant: the chant
became a songthough whether it was _Mein Herr_ that was singing, this
time, or somebody else, I could not feel certain STOP And, now the mischiefs done, perhaps
  Youll kindly go and pack your traps STOP Since _two_ (your daughter and your son)
  Are Company, but _three_ are none STOP A course of saving well begin:
  When change is needed, _Ill_ invent it:
  Dont think to put _your_ finger in
  _This_ pie STOP cried Tottles (and he meant it) STOP The music seemed to die away STOP Mein Herr was again speaking in his
ordinary voice STOP Now tell me one thing more, he said STOP Am I right in
thinking that in _your_ Universities, though a man may reside some
thirty or forty years, you examine him, once for all, at the end of the
first three or four STOP That is so, undoubtedly, I admitted STOP Practically, then, you examine a man at the _beginning_ of his career STOP the old man said to himself rather than to me STOP And what guarantee have
you that he _retains_ the knowledge for which you have rewarded
himbeforehand, as _we_ should say STOP None, I admitted, feeling a little puzzled at the drift of his
remarks STOP How do _you_ secure that object STOP By examining him at the _end_ of his thirty or forty yearsnot at the
beginning, he gently replied STOP On an average, the knowledge then found
is about one-fifth of what it was at firstthe process of forgetting
going on at a very steady uniform rateand he, who forgets _least_, gets
_most_ honour, and most rewards STOP Then you give him the money when he needs it no longer STOP And you make
him live most of his life on _nothing_ STOP Hardly that STOP He gives his orders to the tradesmen: they supply him, for
forty, sometimes fifty, years, at their own risk: then he gets his
Fellowshipwhich pays him in _one_ year as much as _your_ Fellowships
pay in fiftyand then he can easily pay all his bills, with interest STOP But suppose he fails to get his Fellowship STOP That must occasionally
happen STOP That occasionally happens STOP It was Mein Herrs turn, now, to make
admissions STOP And what becomes of the tradesmen STOP They calculate accordingly STOP When a man appears to be getting alarmingly
ignorant, or stupid, they will sometimes refuse to supply him any
longer STOP You have no idea with what enthusiasm a man will begin to rub up
his forgotten sciences or languages, when his butcher has cut off the
supply of beef and mutton STOP And who are the Examiners STOP The young men who have just come, brimming over with knowledge STOP You
would think it a curious sight, he went on, to see mere boys examining
such old men STOP I have known a man set to examine his own grandfather STOP It
was a little painful for both of them, no doubt STOP The old gentleman was
as bald as a coot

How bald would that be STOP Ive no idea why I asked this question STOP I felt
I was getting foolish STOP  STOP BRUNOS PICNIC STOP As bald as bald, was the bewildering reply STOP Now, Bruno, Ill tell you
a story STOP And Ill tell _oo_ a story, said Bruno, beginning in a great hurry for
fear of Sylvie getting the start of him: once there were a Mousea
little tiny Mousesuch a tiny little Mouse STOP Oo never saw such a tiny
Mouse

Did nothing ever happen to it, Bruno STOP I asked STOP Havent you anything
more to tell us, besides its being so tiny STOP Nothing never happened to it, Bruno solemnly replied STOP Why did nothing never happen to it STOP said Sylvie, who was sitting, with
her head on Brunos shoulder, patiently waiting for a chance of
beginning _her_ story STOP It were too tiny, Bruno explained STOP _Thats_ no reason STOP I said STOP However tiny it was, things might happen
to it STOP Bruno looked pityingly at me, as if he thought me very stupid STOP It were
too tiny, he repeated STOP If anything happened to it, it would dieit
were so _very_ tiny STOP Really thats enough about its being tiny STOP Sylvie put in STOP Havent you
invented any more about it STOP Havent invented no more yet STOP Well then, you shouldnt begin a story till youve invented more STOP Now
be quiet, theres a good boy, and listen to _my_ story STOP And Bruno, having quite exhausted all his inventive faculty, by
beginning in too great a hurry, quietly resigned himself to listening STOP Tell about the other Bruno, please, he said coaxingly STOP Sylvie put her arms round his neck, and began:

The wind was whispering among the trees, (That wasnt good manners STOP Bruno interrupted STOP Never mind about manners, said Sylvie) and it was
eveninga nice moony evening, and the Owls were hooting

Pretend they werent Owls STOP Bruno pleaded, stroking her cheek with his
fat little hand STOP I dont like Owls STOP Owls have such great big eyes STOP Pretend they were Chickens STOP Are you afraid of their great big eyes, Bruno STOP I said STOP Arent _fraid_ of nothing, Bruno answered in as careless a tone as he
could manage: theyre ugly with their great big eyes STOP I think if they
cried, the tears would be as bigoh, as big as the moon STOP And he laughed
merrily STOP Doos Owls cry ever, Mister Sir STOP Owls cry never, I said gravely, trying to copy Brunos way of
speaking: theyve got nothing to be sorry for, you know STOP Oh, but they have STOP Bruno exclaimed STOP Theyre ever so sorry, cause
they killed the poor little Mouses STOP But theyre not sorry when theyre _hungry_, I suppose STOP Oo dont know nothing about Owls STOP Bruno scornfully remarked STOP When
theyre hungry, theyre very, _very_ sorry they killed the little
Mouses, cause if they _hadnt_ killed them thered be sumfin for
supper, oo know STOP Bruno was evidently getting into a dangerously inventive state of mind,
so Sylvie broke in with Now Im going on with the story STOP So the
Owlsthe Chickens, I meanwere looking to see if they could find a nice
fat Mouse for their supper

Pretend it was a nice abbit STOP said Bruno STOP But it _wasnt_ a nice habit, to kill Mouses, Sylvie argued STOP I cant
pretend _that_ STOP I didnt say _habit_, oo silly fellow STOP Bruno replied with a merry
twinkle in his eye STOP _abbits_that runs about in the fields STOP Rabbit STOP Well it can be a Rabbit, if you like STOP But you mustnt alter my
story so much, Bruno STOP A Chicken _couldnt_ eat a Rabbit STOP But it might have wished to see if it could try to eat it STOP Well, it wished to see if it could tryoh, really, Bruno, thats
nonsense STOP I shall go back to the Owls STOP Well then, pretend they hadnt great eyes STOP And they saw a little Boy, Sylvie went on, disdaining to make any
further corrections STOP And he asked them to tell him a story STOP And the
Owls hooted and flew away (Oo shouldnt say _flewed_; oo should
say _flied_, Bruno whispered STOP But Sylvie wouldnt hear. STOP And he met
a Lion STOP And he asked the Lion to tell him a story STOP And the Lion said
yes, it would STOP And, while the Lion was telling him the story, it
nibbled some of his head off

Dont say nibbled STOP Bruno entreated STOP Only little things
nibblelittle thin sharp things, with edges

Well then, it _nubbled_, said Sylvie STOP And when it had nubbled _all_
his head off, he went away, and he never said thank you STOP That were very rude, said Bruno STOP If he couldnt speak, he might have
noddedno, he couldnt nod STOP Well, he might have shaked _hands_ with the
Lion STOP Oh, Id forgotten that part STOP said Sylvie STOP He _did_ shake hands with
it STOP He came back again, you know, and he thanked the Lion very much, for
telling him the story STOP Then his head had growed up again STOP said Bruno STOP Oh yes, it grew up in a minute STOP And the Lion begged pardon, and said it
wouldnt nubble off little boys headsnot never no more STOP Bruno looked much pleased at this change of events STOP Now that are a
_really_ nice story STOP he said STOP _Arent_ it a nice story, Mister Sir STOP Very, I said STOP I would like to hear another story about that Boy STOP So would _I_, said Bruno, stroking Sylvies cheek again STOP _Please_
tell about Brunos Picnic; and dont talk about _nubbly_ Lions STOP I wont, if it frightens you, said Sylvie STOP _Flightens_ me STOP Bruno exclaimed indignantly STOP It isnt _that_ STOP Its
cause nubbly s such a grumbly word to saywhen one persons got her
head on another persons shoulder STOP When she talks like that, he
explained to me, the talking goes down bofe sides of my faceall the
way to my chinand it _doos_ tickle so STOP Its enough to make a beard
grow, that it is STOP He said this with great severity, but it was evidently meant for a joke:
so Sylvie laugheda delicious musical little laugh, and laid her soft
cheek on the top of her brothers curly head, as if it were a pillow,
while she went on with the story STOP So this Boy

But it wasnt _me_, oo know STOP Bruno interrupted STOP And oo neednt try to
look as if it was, Mister Sir STOP I represented, respectfully, that I was trying to look as if it wasnt STOP he was a middling good Boy

He were a _welly_ good Boy STOP Bruno corrected her STOP And he never did
nothing he wasnt told to do

_That_ doesnt make a good Boy STOP Sylvie said contemptuously STOP That _do_ make a good Boy STOP Bruno insisted STOP Sylvie gave up the point STOP Well, he was a _very_ good Boy, and he always
kept his promises, and he had a big cupboard

for to keep all his promises in STOP cried Bruno STOP If he kept _all_ his promises, Sylvie said, with a mischievous look in
her eyes, he wasnt like _some_ Boys I know of STOP He had to put _salt_ with them, a-course, Bruno said gravely: oo
cant keep promises when there isnt any salt STOP And he kept his birthday
on the second shelf STOP How long did he keep his birthday STOP I asked STOP I never can keep _mine_
more than twenty-four hours STOP Why, a birthday _stays_ that long by itself STOP cried Bruno STOP Oo doosnt
know how to keep birthdays STOP This Boy kept _his_ a whole year STOP And then the next birthday would begin, said Sylvie STOP So it would be
his birthday _always_ STOP So it were, said Bruno STOP Doos _oo_ have treats on _oor_ birthday,
Mister Sir STOP Sometimes, I said STOP When oore _good_, I suppose STOP Why, it _is_ a sort of treat, being good, isnt it STOP I said STOP A sort of _treat_ STOP Bruno repeated STOP Its a sort of _punishment_, _I_
think STOP Oh, Bruno STOP Sylvie interrupted, almost sadly STOP How _can_ you STOP Well, but it _is_, Bruno persisted STOP Why, look here, Mister Sir STOP _This_ is being good STOP And he sat bolt upright, and put on an absurdly
solemn face STOP First oo must sit up as straight as pokers

as _a_ poker, Sylvie corrected him STOP as straight as _pokers_, Bruno firmly repeated STOP Then oo must clasp
oor hands_so_ STOP ThenWhy hasnt oo brushed oor hair STOP Go and brush it
_toreckly_ STOP ThenOh, Bruno, oo mustnt dogs-ear the daisies STOP Did oo
learn _oor_ spelling wiz daisies, Mister Sir STOP I want to hear about that Boys _Birthday_, I said STOP Bruno returned to the story instantly STOP Well, so this Boy said Now its
my Birthday STOP And soIm tired STOP he suddenly broke off, laying his head
in Sylvies lap STOP Sylvie knows it best STOP Sylvies grown-upper than me STOP Go
on, Sylvie STOP Sylvie patiently took up the thread of the story again STOP So he said Now
its my Birthday STOP Whatever shall I do to keep my Birthday STOP All _good_
little Boys (Sylvie turned away from Bruno, and made a great pretence
of whispering to _me_) all _good_ little BoysBoys that learn their
lessons quite perfectthey always keep their birthdays, you know STOP So of
course _this_ little Boy kept _his_ Birthday STOP Oo may call him Bruno, if oo like, the little fellow carelessly
remarked STOP It werent _me_, but it makes it more interesting STOP So Bruno said to himself The properest thing to do is to have a
Picnic, all by myself, on the top of the hill STOP And Ill take some Milk,
and some Bread, and some Apples: and first and foremost, I want some
_Milk_ STOP So, first and foremost, Bruno took a milk-pail

And he went and milkted the Cow STOP Bruno put in STOP Yes, said Sylvie, meekly accepting the new verb STOP And the Cow said
Moo STOP What are you going to do with all that Milk STOP And Bruno said
Pleasem, I want it for my Picnic STOP And the Cow said Moo STOP But I hope
you wont _boil_ any of it STOP And Bruno said No, _indeed_ I wont STOP New
Milks so nice and so warm, it wants no boiling STOP It doesnt want no boiling, Bruno offered as an amended version STOP So Bruno put the Milk in a bottle STOP And then Bruno said Now I want some
Bread STOP So he went to the Oven, and he took out a delicious new Loaf STOP And the Oven

ever so light and so puffy STOP Bruno impatiently corrected her STOP Oo
shouldnt leave out so many words STOP Sylvie humbly apologised STOP a delicious new Loaf, ever so light and so
puffy STOP And the Oven said Here Sylvie made a long pause STOP Really I
dont know _what_ an Oven begins with, when it wants to speak STOP Both children looked appealingly at me; but I could only say,
helplessly, I havent the least idea STOP _I_ never heard an Oven speak STOP For a minute or two we all sat silent; and then Bruno said, very softly,
Oven begins wiz O STOP _Good_ little boy STOP Sylvie exclaimed STOP He does his spelling _very_
nicely STOP _Hes cleverer than he knows!_ she added, aside, to _me_ STOP So
the Oven said O STOP What are you going to do with all that Bread STOP And
Bruno said Please Is an Oven Sir or m, would you say STOP She
looked to me for a reply STOP _Both_, I think, seemed to me the safest thing to say STOP Sylvie adopted the suggestion instantly STOP So Bruno said Please, Sirm, I
want it for my Picnic STOP And the Oven said O STOP But I hope you wont
_toast_ any of it STOP And Bruno said No, _indeed_ I wont STOP New Breads
so light and so puffy, it wants no toasting STOP It never doesnt want no toasting, said Bruno STOP I _wiss_ oo wouldnt
say it so short STOP So Bruno put the Bread in the hamper STOP Then Bruno said Now I want some
Apples STOP So he took the hamper, and he went to the Apple-Tree, and he
picked some lovely ripe Apples STOP And the Apple-Tree said Here followed
another long pause STOP Bruno adopted his favourite expedient of tapping his forehead; while
Sylvie gazed earnestly upwards, as if she hoped for some suggestion from
the birds, who were singing merrily among the branches overhead STOP But no
result followed STOP What _does_ an Apple-tree begin with, when it wants to speak STOP Sylvie
murmured despairingly, to the irresponsive birds STOP At last, taking a leaf out of Brunos book, I ventured on a remark STOP Doesnt Apple-tree always begin with Eh! STOP Why, of _course_ it does STOP How _clever_ of you STOP Sylvie cried
delightedly STOP Bruno jumped up, and patted me on the head STOP I tried not to feel
conceited STOP So the Apple Tree said Eh STOP What are you going to do with all those
Apples STOP And Bruno said Please, Sir, I want them for my Picnic, And
the Apple-Tree said Eh STOP But I hope you wont _bake_ any of them STOP And
Bruno said No, _indeed_ I wont STOP Ripe Apples are so nice and so sweet,
they want no baking STOP They never doesnt Bruno was beginning, but Sylvie corrected herself
before he could get the words out STOP They never doesnt nonow want no baking STOP So Bruno put the Apples in
the hamper, along with the Bread, and the bottle of Milk STOP And he set off
to have a Picnic, on the top of the hill, all by himself

He wasnt greedy, oo know, to have it all by himself, Bruno said,
patting me on the cheek to call my attention; cause he hadnt got no
brothers and sisters STOP It was very sad to have no _sisters_, wasnt it STOP I said STOP Well, I dont know, Bruno said thoughtfully; cause he hadnt no
lessons to do STOP So he didnt mind STOP Sylvie went on STOP So, as he was walking along the road, he heard behind
him such a curious sort of noisea sort of a Thump STOP Thump STOP Thump STOP Whatever _is_ that STOP said Bruno STOP Oh, I know STOP said Bruno STOP Why, its
only my Watch a-ticking STOP _Were_ it his Watch a-ticking STOP Bruno asked me, with eyes that fairly
sparkled with mischievous delight STOP No doubt of it STOP I replied STOP And Bruno laughed exultingly STOP Then Bruno thought a little harder STOP And he said No STOP It _cant_ be my
Watch a-ticking; because I havent _got_ a Watch STOP Bruno peered up anxiously into my face, to see how I took it STOP I hung my
head, and put a thumb into my mouth, to the evident delight of the
little fellow STOP So Bruno went a little further along the road STOP And then he heard it
again, that queer noiseThump STOP Thump STOP Thump STOP What ever _is_ that STOP said
Bruno STOP Oh, I know STOP said Bruno STOP Why, its only the Carpenter a-mending
my Wheelbarrow STOP _Were_ it the Carterpenter a-mending his Wheelbarrow STOP Bruno asked me STOP I brightened up, and said It _must_ have been STOP in a tone of absolute
conviction STOP Bruno threw his arms round Sylvies neck STOP Sylvie STOP he said, in a
perfectly audible whisper STOP He says it _must_ have been STOP Then Bruno thought a little harder STOP And he said No STOP It _cant_ be the
Carpenter amending my Wheelbarrow, because I havent _got_ a
Wheelbarrow STOP This time I hid my face in my hands, quite unable to meet Brunos look
of triumph STOP So Bruno went a little further along the road STOP And then he heard that
queer noise againThump STOP Thump STOP Thump STOP So he thought hed look round,
_this_ time, just to _see_ what it was STOP And what should it be but a
great Lion STOP A great big Lion, Bruno corrected her STOP A great big Lion STOP And Bruno was ever so frightened, and he ran

No, he wasnt _flightened_ a bit STOP Bruno interrupted STOP (He was evidently
anxious for the reputation of his namesake. STOP He runned away to get a
good look at the Lion; cause he wanted to see if it were the same Lion
what used to nubble little Boys heads off; and he wanted to know how
big it was STOP Well, he ran away, to get a good look at the Lion STOP And the Lion trotted
slowly after him STOP And the Lion called after him, in a very gentle voice,
Little Boy, little Boy STOP You neednt be afraid of _me_ STOP Im a very
_gentle_ old Lion now STOP I _never_ nubble little Boys heads off, as I
used to do STOP And so Bruno said Dont you _really_, Sir STOP Then what do
you live on STOP And the Lion

Oo _see_ he werent a bit flightened STOP Bruno said to me, patting my
cheek again STOP cause he remembered to call it Sir, oo know STOP I said that no doubt that was the _real_ test whether a person was
frightened or not STOP And the Lion said Oh, I live on bread-and-butter, and cherries, and
marmalade, and plum-cake

and _apples_ STOP Bruno put in STOP Yes, and apples STOP And Bruno said Wont you come with me to my
Picnic STOP And the Lion said Oh, I should like it _very much indeed_ STOP And Bruno and the Lion went away together STOP Sylvie stopped suddenly STOP Is that _all_ STOP I asked, despondingly STOP Not _quite_ all, Sylvie slily replied STOP Theres a sentence or two
more STOP Isnt there, Bruno STOP Yes, with a carelessness that was evidently put on: just a sentence
or two more STOP And, as they were walking along, they looked over a hedge, and who
should they see but a little black Lamb STOP And the Lamb was ever so
frightened STOP And it ran

It were _really_ flightened STOP Bruno put in STOP It ran away STOP And Bruno ran after it STOP And he called Little Lamb STOP You
neednt be afraid of _this_ Lion STOP It _never_ kills things STOP It lives on
cherries, and marmalade

and _apples_ STOP said Bruno STOP Oo _always_ forgets the apples STOP And Bruno said Wont you come with us to my Picnic STOP And the Lamb
said Oh, I should like it _very much indeed_, if my Ma will let me STOP And Bruno said Lets go and ask your Ma STOP And they went to the old
Sheep STOP And Bruno said Please, may your little Lamb come to my Picnic STOP And the Sheep said Yes, if its learnt all its lessons STOP And the Lamb
said Oh yes, Ma STOP Ive learnt _all_ my lessons STOP Pretend it hadnt any lessons STOP Bruno earnestly pleaded STOP Oh, that would never do STOP said Sylvie STOP I cant leave out all about
the lessons STOP And the old Sheep said Do you know your A B C yet STOP Have
you learnt A STOP And the Lamb said Oh yes, Ma STOP I went to the A-field, and
I helped them to make A STOP Very good, my child STOP And have you learnt B STOP Oh yes, Ma STOP I went to the B-hive, and the B gave me some honey STOP Very
good, my child STOP And have you learnt C STOP Oh yes, Ma STOP I went to the
C-side, and I saw the ships sailing on the C STOP Very good, my child STOP You
may go to Brunos Picnic STOP [Illustration: STARTING FOR BRUNOS PICNIC]

So they set off STOP And Bruno walked in the middle, so that the Lamb
mightnt see the Lion

It were _flightened_, Bruno explained STOP Yes, and it trembled so; and it got paler and paler; and, before theyd
got to the top of the hill, it was a _white_ little Lambas white as
snow STOP But _Bruno_ werent flightened STOP said the owner of that name STOP So _he_
staid black STOP No, he _didnt_ stay black STOP He staid _pink_ STOP laughed Sylvie STOP I
shouldnt kiss you like this, you know, if you were _black_ STOP Ood _have_ to STOP Bruno said with great decision STOP Besides, Bruno wasnt
_Bruno_, oo knowI mean, Bruno wasnt _me_I meandont talk nonsense,
Sylvie STOP I wont do it again STOP Sylvie said very humbly STOP And so, as they went
along, the Lion said Oh, Ill tell you what I used to do when I was a
young Lion STOP I used to hide behind trees, to watch for little Boys STOP (Bruno cuddled a little closer to her. STOP And, if a little thin scraggy
Boy came by, why, I used to let him go STOP But, if a little fat juicy

Bruno could bear no more STOP Pretend he wasnt juicy STOP he pleaded,
half-sobbing STOP Nonsense, Bruno STOP Sylvie briskly replied STOP Itll be done in a moment STOP if a little fat juicy Boy came by, why, I used to spring out and
gobble him up STOP Oh, youve no _idea_ what a delicious thing it isa
little juicy Boy STOP And Bruno said Oh, if you please, Sir, _dont_ talk
about eating little boys STOP It makes me so _shivery_ STOP The real Bruno shivered, in sympathy with the hero STOP And the Lion said Oh, well, we wont talk about it, then STOP Ill tell
you what happened on my wedding-day

I like _this_ part better, said Bruno, patting my cheek to keep me
awake STOP There was, oh, such a lovely wedding-breakfast STOP At _one_ end of the
table there was a large plum-pudding STOP And at the other end there was a
nice roasted _Lamb_ STOP Oh, youve no _idea_ what a delicious thing it isa
nice roasted Lamb STOP And the Lamb said Oh, if you please, Sir, _dont_
talk about eating Lambs STOP It makes me so _shivery_ STOP And the Lion said
Oh, well, we wont talk about it, then STOP  STOP THE LITTLE FOXES STOP So, when they got to the top of the hill, Bruno opened the hamper: and
he took out the Bread, and the Apples, and the Milk: and they ate, and
they drank STOP And when theyd finished the Milk, and eaten half the Bread
and half the Apples, the Lamb said Oh, my paws is so sticky STOP I want to
wash my paws STOP And the Lion said Well, go down the hill, and wash them
in the brook, yonder STOP Well wait for you STOP It never comed back STOP Bruno solemnly whispered to me STOP But Sylvie overheard him STOP Youre not to whisper, Bruno STOP It spoils the
story STOP And when the Lamb had been gone a long time, the Lion said to
Bruno Do go and see after that silly little Lamb STOP It must have lost its
way STOP And Bruno went down the hill STOP And when he got to the brook, he saw
the Lamb sitting on the bank: and who should be sitting by it but an old
Fox STOP Dont know who _should_ be sitting by it, Bruno said thoughtfully to
himself STOP A old Fox _were_ sitting by it STOP And the old Fox were saying, Sylvie went on, for once conceding the
grammatical point, Yes, my dear, youll be ever so happy with us, if
youll only come and see us STOP Ive got three little Foxes there, and we
do love little Lambs so dearly STOP And the Lamb said But you never _eat_
them, do you, Sir STOP And the Fox said Oh, no STOP What, _eat_ a Lamb STOP We
never _dream_ of doing such a thing STOP So the Lamb said Then Ill come
with you STOP And off they went, hand in hand STOP That Fox were welly extremely wicked, _werent_ it STOP said Bruno STOP No, no STOP said Sylvie, rather shocked at such violent language STOP It
wasnt quite so bad as that STOP Well, I mean, it wasnt nice, the little fellow corrected himself STOP And so Bruno went back to the Lion STOP Oh, come quick STOP he said STOP The Fox
has taken the Lamb to his house with him STOP Im _sure_ he means to eat
it STOP And the Lion said Ill come as quick as ever I can STOP And they
trotted down the hill STOP Do oo think he caught the Fox, Mister Sir STOP said Bruno STOP I shook my
head, not liking to speak: and Sylvie went on STOP And when they got to the house, Bruno looked in at the window STOP And
there he saw the three little Foxes sitting round the table, with their
clean pinafores on, and spoons in their hands

Spoons in their hands STOP Bruno repeated in an ecstasy of delight STOP And the Fox had got a great big knifeall ready to kill the poor little
Lamb (Oo neednt be flightened, Mister Sir STOP Bruno put in, in a
hasty whisper. STOP [Illustration: ENTER THE LION]

And just as he was going to do it, Bruno heard a great ROAR (The
real Bruno put his hand into mine, and held tight), and the Lion came
_bang_ through the door, and the next moment it had bitten off the old
Foxs head STOP And Bruno jumped in at the window, and went leaping round
the room, and crying out Hooray STOP Hooray STOP The old Fox is dead STOP The old
Fox is dead STOP Bruno got up in some excitement STOP May I do it now STOP he enquired STOP Sylvie was quite decided on this point STOP Wait till afterwards, she
said STOP The speeches come next, dont you know STOP You always love the
speeches, _dont_ you STOP Yes, I doos, said Bruno: and sat down again STOP The Lions speech STOP Now, you silly little Lamb, go home to your mother,
and never listen to old Foxes again STOP And be very good and obedient STOP The Lambs speech STOP Oh, indeed, Sir, I will, Sir STOP and the Lamb went
away STOP (But _oo_ neednt go away STOP Bruno explained STOP Its quite the
nicest partwhats coming now STOP Sylvie smiled STOP She liked having an
appreciative audience. STOP The Lions speech to Bruno STOP Now, Bruno, take those little Foxes home
with you, and teach them to be good obedient little Foxes STOP Not like that
wicked old thing there, thats got no head STOP (That hasnt got no
head, Bruno repeated. STOP Brunos speech to the Lion STOP Oh, indeed, Sir, I will, Sir STOP And the
Lion went away STOP (It gets betterer and betterer, now, Bruno whispered
to me, right away to the end! STOP Brunos speech to the little Foxes STOP Now, little Foxes, youre going to
have your first lesson in being good STOP Im going to put you into the
hamper, along with the Apples and the Bread: and youre not to eat the
Apples: and youre not to eat the Bread: and youre not to eat
_anything_till we get to my house: and then youll have your supper STOP The little Foxes speech to Bruno STOP The little Foxes said nothing STOP So Bruno put the Apples into the hamperand the little Foxesand the
Bread (They had picnicked all the Milk, Bruno explained in a
whisper) and he set off to go to his house STOP (Were getting near the
end now, said Bruno. STOP And, when he had got a little way, he thought he would look into the
hamper, and see how the little Foxes were getting on STOP So he opened the door said Bruno STOP Oh, Bruno STOP Sylvie exclaimed, _youre_ not telling the story STOP So he
opened the door, and behold, there were no Apples STOP So Bruno said Eldest
little Fox, have _you_ been eating the Apples STOP And the eldest little
Fox said No no no STOP (It is impossible to give the tone in which Sylvie
repeated this rapid little No no no STOP The nearest I can come to it is
to say that it was much as if a young and excited duck had tried to
quack the words STOP It was too quick for a quack, and yet too harsh to be
anything else. STOP Then he said Second little Fox, have _you_ been eating
the Apples STOP And the second little Fox said No no no STOP Then he said
Youngest little Fox, have _you_ been eating the Apples STOP And the
youngest little Fox _tried_ to say No no no STOP but its mouth was so
full, it couldnt, and it only said Wauch STOP Wauch STOP Wauch STOP And Bruno
looked into its mouth STOP And its mouth was full of Apples STOP And Bruno shook
his head, and he said Oh dear, oh dear STOP What bad creatures these Foxes
are STOP Bruno was listening intently: and, when Sylvie paused to take breath, he
could only just gasp out the words About the Bread STOP Yes, said Sylvie, the Bread comes next STOP So he shut the door again;
and he went a little further; and then he thought hed just peep in once
more STOP And behold, there was no Bread STOP (What do behold _mean_ STOP said
Bruno STOP Hush STOP said Sylvie. STOP And he said Eldest little Fox, have _you_
been eating the Bread STOP And the eldest little Fox said No no no STOP Second little Fox, have _you_ been eating the Bread STOP And the second
little Fox only said Wauch STOP Wauch STOP Wauch STOP And Bruno looked into its
mouth, and its mouth was full of Bread STOP (It might have chokeded it,
said Bruno. STOP So he said Oh dear, oh dear STOP What _shall_ I do with these
Foxes STOP And he went a little further STOP (Now comes the most interesting
part, Bruno whispered. STOP And when Bruno opened the hamper again, what do you think he saw STOP (Only _two_ Foxes STOP Bruno cried in a great hurry. STOP You shouldnt tell
it so quick STOP However, he _did_ see only _two_ Foxes STOP And he said Eldest
little Fox, have you been eating the youngest little Fox STOP And the
eldest little Fox said No no no STOP Second little Fox, have _you_ been
eating the youngest little Fox STOP And the second little Fox did its very
best to say No no no STOP but it could only say Weuchk STOP Weuchk STOP Weuchk STOP And when Bruno looked into its mouth, it was half full of Bread, and
half full of Fox STOP (Bruno said nothing in the pause this time STOP He was
beginning to pant a little, as he knew the crisis was coming. STOP And when hed got nearly home, he looked once more into the hamper, and
he saw

Only Bruno began, but a generous thought struck him, and he looked
at me STOP _Oo_ may say it, _this_ time, Mister Sir STOP he whispered STOP It was
a noble offer, but I wouldnt rob him of the treat STOP Go on, Bruno, I
said, you say it much the best STOP Onlybut_one_Fox STOP Bruno said with
great solemnity STOP [Illustration: WHIHUAUCH STOP WHIHUAUCH! STOP Eldest little Fox, Sylvie said, dropping the narrative-form in her
eagerness, youve been _so_ good that I can hardly believe _youve_
been disobedient: but Im _afraid_ youve been eating your little
sister STOP And the eldest little Fox said Whihuauch STOP Whihuauch STOP and then
it choked STOP And Bruno looked into its mouth, and it _was_ full STOP (Sylvie
paused to take breath, and Bruno lay back among the daisies, and looked
at me triumphantly STOP Isnt it _grand_, Mister Sir STOP said he STOP I tried
hard to assume a critical tone STOP Its grand, I said: but it frightens
one so STOP Oo may sit a little closer to _me_, if oo like, said Bruno. STOP And so Bruno went home: and took the hamper into the kitchen, and
opened it STOP And he saw Sylvie looked at _me_, this time, as if she
thought I had been rather neglected and ought to be allowed _one_ guess,
at any rate STOP He cant guess STOP Bruno cried eagerly STOP I fraid I _must_ tell him STOP There werent_nuffin_ in the hamper STOP I shivered in terror, and Bruno
clapped his hands with delight STOP He _is_ flightened, Sylvie STOP Tell the
rest STOP So Bruno said Eldest little Fox, have you been eating _yourself_, you
wicked little Fox STOP And the eldest little Fox said Whihuauch STOP And then
Bruno saw there was only its _mouth_ in the hamper STOP So he took the
mouth, and he opened it, and shook, and shook STOP And at last he shook the
little Fox out of its own mouth STOP And then he said Open your mouth
again, you wicked little thing STOP And he shook, and shook STOP And he shook
out the second little Fox STOP And he said Now open _your_ mouth STOP And he
shook, and shook STOP And he shook out the youngest little Fox, and all the
Apples, and all the Bread STOP And then Bruno stood the little Foxes up against the wall: and he made
them a little speech STOP Now, little Foxes, youve begun very wickedlyand
youll have to be punished STOP First youll go up to the nursery, and wash
your faces, and put on clean pinafores STOP Then youll hear the bell ring
for supper STOP Then youll come down: and _you wont have any supper_: but
youll have a good _whipping_ STOP Then youll go to bed STOP Then in the
morning youll hear the bell ring for breakfast STOP _But you wont have any
breakfast!_ Youll have a good _whipping_ STOP Then youll have your
lessons STOP And, perhaps, if youre _very_ good, when dinner-time comes,
youll have a little dinner, and no more whipping STOP (How _very_ kind
he was STOP I whispered to Bruno STOP _Middling_ kind, Bruno corrected me
gravely. STOP So the little Foxes ran up to the nursery STOP And soon Bruno went into the
hall, and rang the big bell STOP Tingle, tingle, tingle STOP Supper, supper,
supper STOP Down came the little Foxes, in such a hurry for their supper STOP Clean pinafores STOP Spoons in their hands STOP And, when they got into the
dining-room, there was ever such a white table-cloth on the table STOP But
there was nothing on it but a big whip STOP And they had _such_ a whipping STOP (I put my handkerchief to my eyes, and Bruno hastily climbed upon my
knee and stroked my face STOP Only _one_ more whipping, Mister Sir STOP he
whispered STOP Dont cry more than oo cant help! STOP And the next morning early, Bruno rang the big bell again STOP Tingle,
tingle, tingle STOP Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast STOP Down came the little
Foxes STOP Clean pinafores STOP Spoons in their hands STOP No breakfast STOP Only the
big whip STOP Then came lessons, Sylvie hurried on, for I still had my
handkerchief to my eyes STOP And the little Foxes were ever so good STOP And
they learned their lessons backwards, and forwards, and upside-down STOP And
at last Bruno rang the big bell again STOP Tingle, tingle, tingle STOP Dinner,
dinner, dinner STOP And when the little Foxes came down (Had they clean
pinafores on STOP Bruno enquired STOP Of course STOP said Sylvie STOP And spoons STOP Why, you _know_ they had STOP Couldnt be _certain_, said Bruno. STOP they
came as slow as slow STOP And they said Oh STOP Therell be no dinner STOP Therell
only be the big whip STOP But, when they got into the room, they saw the
most _lovely_ dinner STOP (Buns STOP cried Bruno, clapping his hands. STOP Buns,
and cake, and (and jam STOP said Bruno. STOP Yes, jamand soupand
(and _sugar plums_ STOP Bruno put in once more; and Sylvie seemed
satisfied. STOP And ever after that, they _were_ such good little Foxes STOP They did their
lessons as good as goldand they never did what Bruno told them not
toand they never ate each other any moreand _they never ate
themselves_ STOP The story came to an end so suddenly, it almost took my breath away;
however I did my best to make a pretty speech of thanks STOP Im sure its
veryveryvery much so, Im sure STOP I seemed to hear myself say STOP  STOP BEYOND THESE VOICES STOP I didnt quite catch what you said STOP were the next words that reached
my ear, but certainly _not_ in the voice either of Sylvie or of Bruno,
whom I could just see, through the crowd of guests, standing by the
piano, and listening to the Counts song STOP Mein Herr was the speaker STOP I
didnt quite catch what you said STOP he repeated STOP But Ive no doubt you
take _my_ view of it STOP Thank you _very_ much for your kind attention STOP There is only but _one_ verse left to be sung STOP These last words were
not in the gentle voice of Mein Herr, but in the deep bass of the French
Count STOP And, in the silence that followed, the final stanza of Tottles
rang through the room STOP [Illustration: NEVER STOP YELLED TOTTLES]

  See now this couple settled down
  In quiet lodgings, out of town:
  Submissively the tearful wife
  Accepts a plain and humble life:
  Yet begs one boon on bended knee:
  My ducky-darling, dont resent it STOP Mamma might come for two or three
  NEVER STOP yelled Tottles STOP And he meant it STOP The conclusion of the song was followed by quite a chorus of thanks and
compliments from all parts of the room, which the gratified singer
responded to by bowing low in all directions STOP It is to me a great
privilege, he said to Lady Muriel, to have met with this so marvellous
a song STOP The accompaniment to him is so strange, so mysterious: it is as
if a new music were to be invented STOP I will play him once again so as
that to show you what I mean STOP He returned to the piano, but the song
had vanished STOP The bewildered singer searched through the heap of music lying on an
adjoining table, but it was not there, either STOP Lady Muriel helped in the
search: others soon joined: the excitement grew STOP What _can_ have become
of it STOP exclaimed Lady Muriel STOP Nobody knew: one thing only was certain,
that no one had been near the piano since the Count had sung the last
verse of the song STOP Nevare mind him STOP he said, most good-naturedly STOP I shall give it you
with memory alone STOP He sat down, and began vaguely fingering the notes;
but nothing resembling the tune came out STOP Then he, too, grew excited STOP But what oddness STOP How much of singularity STOP That I might lose, not the
words alone, but the tune alsothat is quite curious, I suppose STOP We all supposed it, heartily STOP It was that sweet little boy, who found it for me, the Count
suggested STOP Quite perhaps _he_ is the thief STOP Of course he is STOP cried Lady Muriel STOP Bruno STOP Where are you, my
darling STOP But no Bruno replied: it seemed that the two children had vanished as
suddenly, and as mysteriously, as the song STOP They are playing us a trick STOP Lady Muriel gaily exclaimed STOP This is
only an _ex tempore_ game of Hide-and-Seek STOP That little Bruno is an
embodied Mischief STOP The suggestion was a welcome one to most of us, for some of the guests
were beginning to look decidedly uneasy STOP A general search was set on
foot with much enthusiasm: curtains were thrown back and shaken,
cupboards opened, and ottomans turned over; but the number of possible
hiding-places proved to be strictly limited; and the search came to an
end almost as soon as it had begun STOP They must have run out, while we were wrapped up in the song, Lady
Muriel said, addressing herself to the Count, who seemed more agitated
than the others; and no doubt theyve found their way back to the
housekeepers room STOP Not by _this_ door STOP was the earnest protest of a knot of two or three
gentlemen, who had been grouped round the door (one of them actually
leaning against it) for the last half-hour, as they declared STOP _This_
door has not been opened since the song began STOP An uncomfortable silence followed this announcement STOP Lady Muriel
ventured no further conjectures, but quietly examined the fastenings of
the windows, which opened as doors STOP They all proved to be well fastened,
_inside_ STOP Not yet at the end of her resources, Lady Muriel rang the bell STOP Ask the
housekeeper to step here, she said, and to bring the childrens
walking-things with her STOP Ive brought them, my Lady, said the obsequious housekeeper, entering
after another minute of silence STOP I thought the young lady would have
come to my room to put on her boots STOP Heres your boots, my love STOP she
added cheerfully, looking in all directions for the children STOP There was
no answer, and she turned to Lady Muriel with a puzzled smile STOP Have the
little darlings hid themselves STOP I dont see them, just now, Lady Muriel replied, rather evasively STOP You can leave their things here, Wilson STOP _Ill_ dress them, when
theyre ready to go STOP The two little hats, and Sylvies walking-jacket, were handed round
among the ladies, with many exclamations of delight STOP There certainly was
a sort of witchery of beauty about them STOP Even the little boots did not
miss their share of favorable criticism STOP Such natty little things STOP the
musical young lady exclaimed, almost fondling them as she spoke STOP And
what tiny tiny feet they must have STOP Finally, the things were piled together on the centre-ottoman, and the
guests, despairing of seeing the children again, began to wish
good-night and leave the house STOP There were only some eight or nine leftto whom the Count was
explaining, for the twentieth time, how he had had his eye on the
children during the last verse of the song; how he had then glanced
round the room, to see what effect de great chest-note had had upon
his audience; and how, when he looked back again, they had both
disappearedwhen exclamations of dismay began to be heard on all sides,
the Count hastily bringing his story to an end to join in the outcry STOP The walking-things had all disappeared STOP After the utter failure of the search for the _children_, there was a
very half-hearted search made for their _apparel_ STOP The remaining guests
seemed only too glad to get away, leaving only the Count and our four
selves STOP The Count sank into an easy-chair, and panted a little STOP Who then _are_ these dear children, I pray you STOP he said STOP Why come
they, why go they, in this so little ordinary a fashion STOP That the music
should make itself to vanishthat the hats, the boots, should make
themselves to vanishhow is it, I pray you STOP Ive no idea where they are STOP was all I could say, on finding myself
appealed to, by general consent, for an explanation STOP The Count seemed about to ask further questions, but checked himself STOP The hour makes himself to become late, he said STOP I wish to you a very
good night, my Lady STOP I betake myself to my bedto dreamif that indeed I
be not dreaming now STOP And he hastily left the room STOP Stay awhile, stay awhile STOP said the Earl, as I was about to follow the
Count STOP _You_ are not a guest, you know STOP Arthurs friend is at _home_
here STOP Thanks STOP I said, as, with true English instincts, we drew our chairs
together round the fire-place, though no fire was burningLady Muriel
having taken the heap of music on her knee, to have one more search for
the strangely-vanished song STOP Dont you sometimes feel a wild longing, she said, addressing herself
to me, to have something more to do with your hands, while you talk,
than just holding a cigar, and now and then knocking off the ash STOP Oh, I
know all that youre going to say STOP (This was to Arthur, who appeared
about to interrupt her. STOP The Majesty of Thought supersedes the work of
the fingers STOP A Mans severe thinking, _plus_ the shaking-off a
cigar-ash, comes to the same total as a Womans trivial fancies, _plus_
the most elaborate embroidery STOP _Thats_ your sentiment, isnt it, only
better expressed STOP Arthur looked into the radiant, mischievous face, with a grave and very
tender smile STOP Yes, he said resignedly: that is my sentiment,
exactly STOP Rest of body, and activity of mind, I put in STOP Some writer tells us
_that_ is the acme of human happiness STOP Plenty of _bodily_ rest, at any rate STOP Lady Muriel replied, glancing at
the three recumbent figures around her STOP But what you call activity of
_mind_

is the privilege of young Physicians _only_, said the Earl STOP We old
men have no claim to be active STOP _What can an old man do but die?_

A good many other things, I should _hope_, Arthur said earnestly STOP Well, maybe STOP Still you have the advantage of me in many ways, dear boy STOP Not only that _your_ day is dawning while _mine_ is setting, but your
_interest_ in Lifesomehow I cant help envying you _that_ STOP It will be
many a year before you lose your hold of _that_ STOP Yet surely many human interests _survive_ human Life STOP I said STOP Many do, no doubt STOP And _some_ forms of Science; but only _some_, I
think STOP Mathematics, for instance: _that_ seems to possess an endless
interest: one cant imagine _any_ form of Life, or _any_ race of
intelligent beings, where Mathematical truth would lose its meaning STOP But
I fear _Medicine_ stands on a different footing STOP Suppose you discover a
remedy for some disease hitherto supposed to be incurable STOP Well, it is
delightful for the moment, no doubtfull of interestperhaps it brings
you fame and fortune STOP But what then STOP Look on, a few years, into a life
where disease has no existence STOP What is your discovery worth, _then_ STOP Milton makes Jove promise too much STOP _Of so much fame in heaven expect
thy meed._ Poor comfort, when ones fame concerns matters that will
have ceased to have a meaning STOP At any rate, one wouldnt care to make any _fresh_ medical
discoveries, said Arthur STOP I see no help for _that_though I shall be
sorry to give up my favorite studies STOP Still, medicine, disease, pain,
sorrow, sinI fear theyre all linked together STOP Banish sin, and you
banish them all STOP _Military_ science is a yet stronger instance, said the Earl STOP Without
sin, _war_ would surely be impossible STOP Still any mind, that has had in
this life any keen interest, not in _itself_ sinful, will surely find
itself _some_ congenial line of work hereafter STOP Wellington may have no
more _battles_ to fightand yet

  We doubt not that, for one so true,
  There must be other, nobler work to do,
  Than when he fought at Waterloo,
        And Victor he must ever be STOP He lingered over the beautiful words, as if he loved them: and his
voice, like distant music, died away into silence STOP After a minute or two he began again STOP If Im not wearying you, I would
like to tell you an idea of the future Life which has haunted me for
years, like a sort of waking nightmareI cant reason myself out of
it STOP Pray do, Arthur and I replied, almost in a breath STOP Lady Muriel put
aside the heap of music, and folded her hands together STOP The one idea, the Earl resumed, that has seemed to me to overshadow
all the rest, is that of _Eternity_involving, as it seems to do, the
necessary _exhaustion_ of all subjects of human interest STOP Take Pure
Mathematics, for instancea Science independent of our present
surroundings STOP I have studied it, myself, a little STOP Take the subject of
circles and ellipseswhat we call curves of the second degree STOP In a
future Life, it would only be a question of so many years (or _hundreds_
of years, if you like), for a man to work out _all_ their properties STOP Then he _might_ go to curves of the third degree STOP Say _that_ took ten
times as long (you see we have _unlimited_ time to deal with) STOP I can
hardly imagine his _interest_ in the subject holding out even for those;
and, though there is no limit to the _degree_ of the curves he might
study, yet surely the time, needed to exhaust _all_ the novelty and
interest of the subject, would be absolutely _finite_ STOP And so of all
other branches of Science STOP And, when I transport myself, in thought,
through some thousands or millions of years, and fancy myself possessed
of as much Science as one created reason can carry, I ask myself What
then STOP With nothing more to learn, can one rest content on _knowledge_,
for the eternity yet to be lived through STOP It has been a very wearying
thought to me STOP I have sometimes fancied one _might_, in that event, say
It is better _not_ to be, and pray for personal _annihilation_the
Nirvana of the Buddhists STOP But that is only half the picture, I said STOP Besides working for
_oneself_, may there not be the helping of _others_ STOP Surely, surely STOP Lady Muriel exclaimed in a tone of relief, looking at
her father with sparkling eyes STOP Yes, said the Earl, so long as there _were_ any others needing help STOP But, given ages and ages more, surely all created reasons would at
length reach the same dead level of _satiety_ STOP And _then_ what is there
to look forward to STOP I know that weary feeling, said the young Doctor STOP I have gone through
it all, more than once STOP Now let me tell you how I have put it to myself STOP I have imagined a little child, playing with toys on his nursery-floor,
and yet able to _reason_, and to look on, thirty years ahead STOP Might he
not say to himself By that time I shall have had enough of bricks and
ninepins STOP How weary Life will be STOP Yet, if we look forward through those
thirty years, we find him a great statesman, full of interests and joys
far more intense than his baby-life could givejoys wholly inconceivable
to his baby-mindjoys such as no baby-language could in the faintest
degree describe STOP Now, may not our life, a million years hence, have the
same relation, to our life now, that the mans life has to the childs STOP And, just as one might try, all in vain, to express to that child, in
the language of bricks and ninepins, the meaning of politics, so
perhaps all those descriptions of Heaven, with its music, and its
feasts, and its streets of gold, may be only attempts to describe, in
_our_ words, things for which we _really_ have no words at all STOP Dont
you think that, in _your_ picture of another life, you are in fact
transplanting that child into political life, without making any
allowance for his growing up STOP I think I understand you, said the Earl STOP The music of Heaven _may_ be
something beyond our powers of thought STOP Yet the music of Earth is sweet STOP Muriel, my child, sing us something before we go to bed STOP Do, said Arthur, as he rose and lit the candles on the cottage-piano,
lately banished from the drawing-room to make room for a semi-grand STOP There is a song here, that I have never heard you sing STOP Hail to thee, blithe spirit STOP Bird thou never wert,
  That from Heaven, or near it,
    Pourest thy full heart STOP he read from the page he had spread open before her STOP And our little life here, the Earl went on, is, to that grand time,
like a childs summer-day STOP One gets tired as night draws on, he added,
with a touch of sadness in his voice, and one gets to long for bed STOP For
those welcome words Come, child, tis bed-time STOP  STOP TO THE RESCUE STOP It _isnt_ bed-time STOP said a sleepy little voice STOP The owls hasnt gone
to bed, and I sant go to seep wizout oo sings to me STOP Oh, Bruno STOP cried Sylvie STOP Dont you know the owls have only just got
up STOP But the _frogs_ have gone to bed, ages ago STOP Well, _I_ arent a frog, said Bruno STOP What shall I sing STOP said Sylvie, skilfully avoiding the argument STOP Ask Mister Sir, Bruno lazily replied, clasping his hands behind his
curly head, and lying back on his fern-leaf, till it almost bent over
with his weight STOP This arent a comfable leaf, Sylvie STOP Find me a
comfablerplease STOP he added, as an after-thought, in obedience to a
warning finger held up by Sylvie STOP I doosnt like being feet-upwards STOP It was a pretty sight to seethe motherly way in which the fairy-child
gathered up her little brother in her arms, and laid him on a stronger
leaf STOP She gave it just a touch to set it rocking, and it went on
vigorously by itself, as if it contained some hidden machinery STOP It
certainly wasnt the wind, for the evening-breeze had quite died away
again, and not a leaf was stirring over our heads STOP Why does that one leaf rock so, without the others STOP I asked Sylvie STOP She only smiled sweetly and shook her head STOP I dont know _why_, she
said STOP It always does, if its got a fairy-child on it STOP It _has_ to, you
know STOP And can people see the leaf rock, who cant see the Fairy on it STOP Why, of course STOP cried Sylvie STOP A leafs a leaf, and everybody can see
it; but Brunos Bruno, and they cant see _him_, unless theyre eerie,
like you STOP Then I understood how it was that one sometimes seesgoing through the
woods in a still eveningone fern-leaf rocking steadily on, all by
itself STOP Havent you ever seen that STOP Try if you can see the fairy-sleeper
on it, next time; but dont _pick_ the leaf, whatever you do; let the
little one sleep on STOP But all this time Bruno was getting sleepier and sleepier STOP Sing, sing STOP he murmured fretfully STOP Sylvie looked to me for instructions STOP What shall
it be STOP she said STOP Could you sing him the nursery-song you once told me of STOP I suggested STOP The one that had been put through the mind-mangle, you know STOP _The
little man that had a little gun_, I think it was STOP Why, that are one of the _Professors_ songs STOP cried Bruno STOP I likes
the little man; and I likes the way they spinned himlike a
teetle-totle-tum STOP And he turned a loving look on the gentle old man who
was sitting at the other side of his leaf-bed, and who instantly began
to sing, accompanying himself on his Outlandish guitar, while the snail,
on which he sat, waved its horns in time to the music STOP [Illustration: BRUNOS BED-TIME]

  In stature the Manlet was dwarfish
    No burly big Blunderbore he:
  And he wearily gazed on the crawfish
    His Wifelet had dressed for his tea STOP Now reach me, sweet Atom, my gunlet,
    And hurl the old shoelet for luck:
  Let me hie to the bank of the runlet,
              And shoot thee a Duck STOP She has reached him his minikin gunlet:
    She has hurled the old shoelet for luck:
  She is busily baking a bunlet,
    To welcome him home with his Duck STOP On he speeds, never wasting a wordlet,
    Though thoughtlets cling, closely as wax,
  To the spot where the beautiful birdlet
                So quietly quacks STOP [Illustration: LONG CEREMONIOUS CALLS]

  Where the Lobsterlet lurks, and the Crablet
    So slowly and sleepily crawls:
  Where the Dolphins at home, and the Dablet
    Pays long ceremonious calls:
  Where the Grublet is sought by the Froglet:
    Where the Frog is pursued by the Duck:
  Where the Ducklet is chased by the Doglet
              So runs the worlds luck STOP [Illustration: THE VOICES]

  He has loaded with bullet and powder:
    His footfall is noiseless as air:
  But the Voices grow louder and louder,
    And bellow, and bluster, and blare STOP They bristle before him and after,
    They flutter above and below,
  Shrill shriekings of lubberly laughter,
                Weird wailings of woe STOP They echo without him, within him:
    They thrill through his whiskers and beard:
  Like a teetotum seeming to spin him,
    With sneers never hitherto sneered STOP Avengement, they cry, on our Foelet STOP Let the Manikin weep for our wrongs STOP Let us drench him, from toplet to toelet,
              With Nursery-Songs STOP [Illustration: HIS SOUL SHALL BE SAD FOR THE SPIDER]

  He shall muse upon Hey STOP Diddle STOP Diddle STOP On the Cow that surmounted the Moon:
  He shall rave of the Cat and the Fiddle,
    And the Dish that eloped with the Spoon:
  And his soul shall be sad for the Spider,
    When Miss Muffet was sipping her whey,
  That so tenderly sat down beside her,
                And scared her away STOP The music of Midsummer-madness
    Shall sting him with many a bite,
  Till, in rapture of rollicking sadness,
    He shall groan with a gloomy delight:
  He shall swathe him, like mists of the morning,
    In platitudes luscious and limp,
  Such as deck, with a deathless adorning,
              The Song of the Shrimp STOP When the Ducklets dark doom is decided,
    We will trundle him home in a trice:
  And the banquet, so plainly provided,
    Shall round into rose-buds and rice:
  In a blaze of pragmatic invention
    He shall wrestle with Fate, and shall reign:
  But he has not a friend fit to mention,
              So hit him again STOP He has shot it, the delicate darling STOP And the Voices have ceased from their strife:
  Not a whisper of sneering or snarling;
    As he carries it home to his wife:
  Then, cheerily champing the bunlet
    His spouse was so skilful to bake,
  He hies him once more to the runlet,
              To fetch her the Drake STOP Hes sound asleep now, said Sylvie, carefully tucking in the edge of a
violet-leaf, which she had been spreading over him as a sort of blanket:
good night STOP Good night STOP I echoed STOP You may well say good night STOP laughed Lady Muriel, rising and
shutting up the piano as she spoke STOP When youve been nidnidnodding
all the time Ive been singing for your benefit STOP What was it all about,
now STOP she demanded imperiously STOP Something about a duck STOP I hazarded STOP Well, a bird of some kind STOP I
corrected myself, perceiving at once that _that_ guess was wrong, at any
rate STOP _Something about a bird of some kind!_ Lady Muriel repeated, with as
much withering scorn as her sweet face was capable of conveying STOP And
thats the way he speaks of Shelleys Sky-Lark, is it STOP When the Poet
particularly says _Hail to thee, blithe spirit!_ Bird _thou never
wert_ STOP [Illustration: LORDS OF THE CREATION]

She led the way to the smoking-room, where, ignoring all the usages of
Society and all the instincts of Chivalry, the three Lords of the
Creation reposed at their ease in low rocking-chairs, and permitted the
one lady who was present to glide gracefully about among us, supplying
our wants in the form of cooling drinks, cigarettes, and lights STOP Nay, it
was only _one_ of the three who had the chivalry to go beyond the
common-place thank you, and to quote the Poets exquisite description
of how Geraint, when waited on by Enid, was moved

  To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb
  That crossed the platter as she laid it down,

and to suit the action to the wordan audacious liberty for which, I
feel bound to report, he was _not_ duly reprimanded STOP As no topic of conversation seemed to occur to any one, and as we were,
all four, on those delightful terms with one another (the only terms, I
think, on which any friendship, that deserves the name of _intimacy_,
can be maintained) which involve no sort of necessity for _speaking_ for
mere speakings sake, we sat in silence for some minutes STOP At length I broke the silence by asking Is there any fresh news from
the harbour about the Fever STOP None since this morning, the Earl said, looking very grave STOP But that
was alarming enough STOP The Fever is spreading fast: the London doctor has
taken fright and left the place, and the only one now available isnt a
regular doctor at all: he is apothecary, and doctor, and dentist, and I
dont know what other trades, all in one STOP Its a bad outlook for those
poor fishermenand a worse one for all the women and children STOP How many are there of them altogether STOP Arthur asked STOP There were nearly one hundred, a week ago STOP said the Earl: but there
have been twenty or thirty deaths since then STOP And what religious ministrations are there to be had STOP There are three brave men down there, the Earl replied, his voice
trembling with emotion, gallant heroes as ever won the Victoria Cross STOP I am certain that no one of the three will ever leave the place merely
to save his own life STOP Theres the Curate: his wife is with him: they
have no children STOP Then theres the Roman Catholic Priest STOP And theres
the Wesleyan Minister STOP They go amongst their own flocks, mostly; but Im
told that those who are dying like to have _any_ of the three with them STOP How slight the barriers seem to be that part Christian from Christian,
when one has to deal with the great facts of Life and the reality of
Death STOP So it must be, and so it should be Arthur was beginning, when the
front-door bell rang, suddenly and violently STOP We heard the front-door hastily opened, and voices outside: then a knock
at the door of the smoking-room, and the old house-keeper appeared,
looking a little scared STOP Two persons, my Lord, to speak with Dr. Forester STOP Arthur stepped outside at once, and we heard his cheery Well, my men STOP but the answer was less audible, the only words I could distinctly catch
being ten since morning, and two more just

But there _is_ a doctor there STOP we heard Arthur say: and a deep voice,
that we had not heard before, replied Dead, Sir STOP Died three hours ago STOP Lady Muriel shuddered, and hid her face in her hands: but at this moment
the front-door was quietly closed, and we heard no more STOP For a few minutes we sat quite silent: then the Earl left the room, and
soon returned to tell us that Arthur had gone away with the two
fishermen, leaving word that he would be back in about an hour STOP And,
true enough, at the end of that intervalduring which very little was
said, none of us seeming to have the heart to talkthe front-door once
more creaked on its rusty hinges, and a step was heard in the passage,
hardly to be recognised as Arthurs, so slow and uncertain was it, like
a blind man feeling his way STOP He came in, and stood before Lady Muriel, resting one hand heavily on
the table, and with a strange look in his eyes, as if he were walking in
his sleep STOP Murielmy love he paused, and his lips quivered: but after a minute
he went on more steadily STOP Murielmy darlingthey_want_ medown in the
harbour STOP _Must_ you go STOP she pleaded, rising and laying her hands on his
shoulders, and looking up into his face with her great eyes brimming
over with tears STOP Must _you_ go, Arthur STOP It may meandeath STOP He met her gaze without flinching STOP It _does_ mean death, he said, in a
husky whisper: butdarlingI am _called_ STOP And even my life itself
His voice failed him, and he said no more STOP For a minute she stood quite silent, looking upwards with a helpless
gaze, as if even prayer were now useless, while her features worked and
quivered with the great agony she was enduring STOP Then a sudden
inspiration seemed to come upon her and light up her face with a strange
sweet smile STOP _Your_ life STOP she repeated STOP It is not _yours_ to give STOP Arthur had recovered himself by this time, and could reply quite firmly,
That is true, he said STOP It is not _mine_ to give STOP It is _yours_, now,
mywife that is to be STOP And youdo _you_ forbid me to go STOP Will you not
spare me, my own beloved one STOP Still clinging to him, she laid her head softly on his breast STOP She had
never done such a thing in my presence before, and I knew how deeply she
must be moved STOP I _will_ spare you, she said, calmly and quietly, to
God STOP And to Gods poor, he whispered STOP And to Gods poor, she added STOP When must it be, sweet love STOP [Illustration: WILL YOU NOT SPARE ME? STOP To-morrow morning, he replied STOP And I have much to do before then STOP And then he told us how he had spent his hour of absence STOP He had been to
the Vicarage, and had arranged for the wedding to take place at eight
the next morning (there was no legal obstacle, as he had, some time
before this, obtained a Special License) in the little church we knew so
well STOP My old friend here, indicating me, will act as Best Man, I
know: your father will be there to give you away: andandyou will
dispense with brides-maids, my darling STOP She nodded: no words came STOP And then I can go with a willing heartto do Gods workknowing that we
are _one_and that we are together in _spirit_, though not in bodily
presenceand are most of all together when we pray STOP Our _prayers_ will
go up together

Yes, yes STOP sobbed Lady Muriel STOP But you must not stay longer now, my
darling STOP Go home and take some rest STOP You will need all your strength
to-morrow

Well, I will go, said Arthur STOP We will be here in good time to-morrow STOP Good night, my own own darling STOP I followed his example, and we two left the house together STOP As we walked
back to our lodgings, Arthur sighed deeply once or twice, and seemed
about to speakbut no words came, till we had entered the house, and had
lit our candles, and were at our bedroom-doors STOP Then Arthur said Good
night, old fellow STOP God bless you STOP God bless you STOP I echoed, from the very depths of my heart STOP We were back again at the Hall by eight in the morning, and found Lady
Muriel and the Earl, and the old Vicar, waiting for us STOP It was a
strangely sad and silent party that walked up to the little church and
back; and I could not help feeling that it was much more like a funeral
than a wedding: to Lady Muriel it _was_ in fact, a funeral rather than a
wedding, so heavily did the presentiment weigh upon her (as she told us
afterwards) that her newly-won husband was going forth to his death STOP Then we had breakfast; and, all too soon, the vehicle was at the door,
which was to convey Arthur, first to his lodgings, to pick up the things
he was taking with him, and then as far towards the death-stricken
hamlet as it was considered safe to go STOP One or two of the fishermen were
to meet him on the road, to carry his things the rest of the way STOP And are you quite sure you are taking all that you will need STOP Lady
Muriel asked STOP All that I shall need as a _doctor_, certainly STOP And my own personal
needs are few: I shall not even take any of my own wardrobethere is a
fishermans suit, ready-made, that is waiting for me at my lodgings STOP I
shall only take my watch, and a few books, andstaythere _is_ one book
I should like to add, a pocket-Testamentto use at the bedsides of the
sick and dying

Take mine STOP said Lady Muriel: and she ran upstairs to fetch it STOP It has
nothing written in it but Muriel, she said as she returned with it:
shall I inscribe

No, my own one, said Arthur, taking it from her STOP What _could_ you
inscribe better than that STOP Could any human name mark it more clearly as
my own individual property STOP Are _you_ not mine STOP Are you not, (with all
the old playfulness of manner) as Bruno would say, my _very mine_ STOP He bade a long and loving adieu to the Earl and to me, and left the
room, accompanied only by his wife, who was bearing up bravely, and
was_outwardly_, at leastless overcome than her old father STOP We waited
in the room a minute or two, till the sound of wheels had told us that
Arthur had driven away; and even then we waited still, for the step of
Lady Muriel, going upstairs to her room, to die away in the distance STOP Her step, usually so light and joyous, now sounded slow and weary, like
one who plods on under a load of hopeless misery; and I felt almost as
hopeless, and almost as wretched, as she STOP Are we four destined _ever_
to meet again, on this side the grave STOP I asked myself, as I walked to
my home STOP And the tolling of a distant bell seemed to answer me, No STOP No STOP No STOP  STOP A NEWSPAPER-CUTTING STOP _EXTRACT FROM THE FAYFIELD CHRONICLE._

_Our readers will have followed with painful interest, the accounts we
have from time to time published of the terrible epidemic which has,
during the last two months, carried off most of the inhabitants of the
little fishing-harbour adjoining the village of Elveston STOP The last
survivors, numbering twenty-three only, out of a population which, three
short months ago, exceeded one hundred and twenty, were removed on
Wednesday last, under the authority of the Local Board, and safely
lodged in the County Hospital: and the place is now veritably a city of
the dead, without a single human voice to break its silence._

_The rescuing party consisted of six sturdy fellowsfishermen from the
neighbourhooddirected by the resident Physician of the Hospital, who
came over for that purpose, heading a train of hospital-ambulances STOP The
six men had been selectedfrom a much larger number who had volunteered
for this peaceful forlorn hopefor their strength and robust health,
as the expedition was considered to be, even now, when the malady has
expended its chief force, not unattended with danger._

_Every precaution that science could suggest, against the risk of
infection, was adopted: and the sufferers were tenderly carried on
litters, one by one, up the steep hill, and placed in the ambulances
which, each provided with a hospital nurse, were waiting on the level
road STOP The fifteen miles, to the Hospital, were done at a walking-pace,
as some of the patients were in too prostrate a condition to bear
jolting, and the journey occupied the whole afternoon._

_The twenty-three patients consist of nine men, six women, and eight
children STOP It has not been found possible to identify them all, as some
of the childrenleft with no surviving relativesare infants; and two
men and one woman are not yet able to make rational replies, the
brain-powers being entirely in abeyance STOP Among a more well-to-do-race,
there would no doubt have been names marked on the clothes; but here no
such evidence is forthcoming._

_Besides the poor fishermen and their families, there were but five
persons to be accounted for: and it was ascertained, beyond a doubt,
that all five are numbered with the dead STOP It is a melancholy pleasure to
place on record the names of these genuine martyrsthan whom none,
surely, are more worthy to be entered on the glory-roll of Englands
heroes STOP They are as follows:_

_The Rev STOP James Burgess, M.A., and Emma his wife STOP He was the Curate at
the Harbour, not thirty years old, and had been married only two years STOP A written record was found in their house, of the dates of their
deaths._

_Next to theirs we will place the honoured name of Dr. Arthur Forester,
who, on the death of the local physician, nobly faced the imminent peril
of death, rather than leave these poor folk uncared for in their last
extremity STOP No record of his name, or of the date of his death, was
found: but the corpse was easily identified, although dressed in the
ordinary fishermans suit (which he was known to have adopted when he
went down there), by a copy of the New Testament, the gift of his wife,
which was found, placed next his heart, with his hands crossed over it STOP It was not thought prudent to remove the body, for burial elsewhere: and
accordingly it was at once committed to the ground, along with four
others found in different houses, with all due reverence STOP His wife,
whose maiden name was Lady Muriel Orme, had been married to him on the
very morning on which he undertook his self-sacrificing mission._

_Next we record the Rev STOP Walter Saunders, Wesleyan Minister STOP His death
is believed to have taken place two or three weeks ago, as the words
Died October 5 were found written on the wall of the room which he is
known to have occupiedthe house being shut up, and apparently not
having been entered for some time._

_Lastthough not a whit behind the other four in glorious self-denial
and devotion to dutylet us record the name of Father Francis, a young
Jesuit Priest who had been only a few months in the place STOP He had not
been dead many hours when the exploring party came upon the body, which
was identified, beyond the possibility of doubt, by the dress, and by
the crucifix which was, like the young Doctors Testament, clasped
closely to his heart._

_Since reaching the hospital, two of the men and one of the children
have died STOP Hope is entertained for all the others: though there are two
or three cases where the vital powers seem to be so entirely exhausted
that it is but hoping against hope to regard ultimate recovery as even
possible._




                               STOP A FAIRY-DUET STOP The yearwhat an eventful year it had been for me!was drawing to a
close, and the brief wintry day hardly gave light enough to recognise
the old familiar objects, bound up with so many happy memories, as the
train glided round the last bend into the station, and the hoarse cry of
Elveston STOP Elveston STOP resounded along the platform STOP It was sad to return to the place, and to feel that I should never again
see the glad smile of welcome, that had awaited me here so few months
ago STOP And yet, if I were to find him here, I muttered, as in solitary
state I followed the porter, who was wheeling my luggage on a barrow,
and if he _were_ to _strike a sudden hand in mine, And ask a thousand
things of home_, I should notno, _I should not feel it to be
strange_ STOP Having given directions to have my luggage taken to my old lodgings, I
strolled off alone, to pay a visit, before settling down in my own
quarters, to my dear old friendsfor such I indeed felt them to be,
though it was barely half a year since first we metthe Earl and his
widowed daughter STOP The shortest way, as I well remembered, was to cross through the
churchyard STOP I pushed open the little wicket-gate and slowly took my way
among the solemn memorials of the quiet dead, thinking of the many who
had, during the past year, disappeared from the place, and had gone to
join the majority STOP A very few steps brought me in sight of the object
of my search STOP Lady Muriel, dressed in the deepest mourning, her face
hidden by a long crape veil, was kneeling before a little marble cross,
round which she was fastening a wreath of flowers STOP The cross stood on a piece of level turf, unbroken by any mound, and I
knew that it was simply a memorial-cross, for one whose dust reposed
elsewhere, even before reading the simple inscription:

                         _In loving Memory of_
                         ARTHUR FORESTER, M.D STOP _whose mortal remains lie buried by the sea:
             whose spirit has returned to God who gave it_ STOP _Greater love hath no man than this, that
               a man lay down his life for his friends._

She threw back her veil on seeing me approach, and came forwards to meet
me, with a quiet smile, and far more self-possessed than I could have
expected STOP It is quite like old times, seeing _you_ here again STOP she said, in
tones of genuine pleasure STOP Have you been to see my father STOP No, I said: I was on my way there, and came through here as the
shortest way STOP I hope he is well, and you also STOP Thanks, we are both quite well STOP And you STOP Are you any better yet STOP Not much better, I fear: but no worse, I am thankful to say STOP Let us sit here awhile, and have a quiet chat, she said STOP The
calmnessalmost indifferenceof her manner quite took me by surprise STOP I
little guessed what a fierce restraint she was putting upon herself STOP One can be so quiet here, she resumed STOP I come here everyevery day STOP It is very peaceful, I said STOP You got my letter STOP Yes, but I delayed writing STOP It is so hard to sayon _paper_

I know STOP It was kind of you STOP You were with us when we saw the last of
She paused a moment, and went on more hurriedly STOP I went down to the
harbour several times, but no one knows which of those vast graves it
is STOP However, they showed me the house he died in: that was some comfort STOP I stood in the very room wherewhere STOP She struggled in vain to go on STOP The flood-gates had given way at last, and the outburst of grief was the
most terrible I had ever witnessed STOP Totally regardless of my presence,
she flung herself down on the turf, burying her face in the grass, and
with her hands clasped round the little marble cross, Oh, my darling,
my darling STOP she sobbed STOP And God meant your life to be so beautiful STOP [Illustration: IN THE CHURCH-YARD]

I was startled to hear, thus repeated by Lady Muriel, the very words of
the darling child whom I had seen weeping so bitterly over the dead
hare STOP Had some mysterious influence passed, from that sweet
fairy-spirit, ere she went back to Fairyland, into the human spirit that
loved her so dearly STOP The idea seemed too wild for belief STOP And yet, are
there not _more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our
philosophy_ STOP God _meant_ it to be beautiful, I whispered, and surely it _was_
beautiful STOP Gods purpose never fails STOP I dared say no more, but rose and
left her STOP At the entrance-gate to the Earls house I waited, leaning on
the gate and watching the sun set, revolving many memoriessome happy,
some sorrowfuluntil Lady Muriel joined me STOP She was quite calm again now STOP Do come in, she said STOP My father will be
so pleased to see you STOP The old man rose from his chair, with a smile, to welcome me; but his
self-command was far less than his daughters, and the tears coursed
down his face as he grasped both my hands in his, and pressed them
warmly STOP My heart was too full to speak; and we all sat silent for a minute or
two STOP Then Lady Muriel rang the bell for tea STOP You _do_ take five oclock
tea, I know STOP she said to me, with the sweet playfulness of manner I
remembered so well, even though you _cant_ work your wicked will on
the Law of Gravity, and make the teacups descend into Infinite Space, a
little faster than the tea STOP This remark gave the tone to our conversation STOP By a tacit mutual
consent, we avoided, during this our first meeting after her great
sorrow, the painful topics that filled our thoughts, and talked like
light-hearted children who had never known a care STOP Did you ever ask yourself the question, Lady Muriel began, _a propos_
of nothing, what is the _chief_ advantage of being a Man instead of a
Dog STOP No, indeed, I said: but I think there are advantages on the _Dogs_
side of the question, as well STOP No doubt, she replied, with that pretty mock-gravity that became her
so well: but, on _Mans_ side, the chief advantage seems to me to
consist in _having pockets_ STOP It was borne in upon meupon _us_, I should
say; for my father and I were returning from a walkonly yesterday STOP We
met a dog carrying home a bone STOP What it wanted it for, Ive no idea:
certainly there was no _meat_ on it

A strange sensation came over me, that I had heard all this, or
something exactly like it, before: and I almost expected her next words
to be perhaps he meant to make a cloak for the winter STOP However what
she really said was and my father tried to account for it by some
wretched joke about _pro bono publico_ STOP Well, the dog laid down the
bone_not_ in disgust with the pun, which would have shown it to be a
dog of tastebut simply to rest its jaws, poor thing STOP I _did_ pity it
so STOP Wont you join my _Charitable Association for supplying dogs with
pockets_ STOP How would _you_ like to have to carry your walking-stick in
your mouth STOP Ignoring the difficult question as to the _raison detre_ of a
walking-stick, supposing one had no _hands_, I mentioned a curious
instance, I had once witnessed, of reasoning by a dog STOP A gentleman, with
a lady, and child, and a large dog, were down at the end of a pier on
which I was walking STOP To amuse his child, I suppose, the gentleman put
down on the ground his umbrella and the ladys parasol, and then led the
way to the other end of the pier, from which he sent the dog back for
the deserted articles STOP I was watching with some curiosity STOP The dog came
racing back to where I stood, but found an unexpected difficulty in
picking up the things it had come for STOP With the umbrella in its mouth,
its jaws were so far apart that it could get no firm grip on the
parasol STOP After two or three failures, it paused and considered the
matter STOP Then it put down the umbrella and began with the parasol STOP Of course that
didnt open its jaws nearly so wide, and it was able to get a good hold
of the umbrella, and galloped off in triumph STOP One couldnt doubt that it
had gone through a real train of logical thought STOP I entirely agree with you, said Lady Muriel: but dont orthodox
writers condemn that view, as putting Man on the level of the lower
animals STOP Dont they draw a sharp boundary-line between Reason and
Instinct STOP That certainly _was_ the orthodox view, a generation ago, said the
Earl STOP The truth of Religion seemed ready to stand or fall with the
assertion that Man was the only reasoning animal STOP But that is at an end
now STOP Man can still claim _certain_ monopoliesfor instance, such a use
of _language_ as enables us to utilise the work of many, by division of
labour STOP But the belief, that we have a monopoly of _Reason_, has long
been swept away STOP Yet no catastrophe has followed STOP As some old poet says,
_God is where he was_ STOP Most religious believers would _now_ agree with Bishop Butler, said I,
and not reject a line of argument, even if it led straight to the
conclusion that animals have some kind of _soul_, which survives their
bodily death STOP I _would_ like to know _that_ to be true STOP Lady Muriel exclaimed STOP If
only for the sake of the poor horses STOP Sometimes Ive thought that, if
anything _could_ make me cease to believe in a God of perfect justice,
it would be the sufferings of horseswithout guilt to deserve it, and
without any compensation STOP It is only part of the great Riddle, said the Earl, why innocent
beings _ever_ suffer STOP It _is_ a great strain on Faithbut not a
_breaking_ strain, I think STOP The sufferings of _horses_, I said, are chiefly caused by _Mans_
cruelty STOP So _that_ is merely one of the many instances of Sin causing
suffering to others than the Sinner himself STOP But dont you find a
_greater_ difficulty in sufferings inflicted by animals upon each other STOP For instance, a cat playing with a mouse STOP Assuming it to have no _moral_
responsibility, isnt that a greater mystery than a man over-driving a
horse STOP I think it _is_, said Lady Muriel, looking a mute appeal to her
father STOP What right have we to make that assumption STOP said the Earl STOP _Many_ of
our religious difficulties are merely deductions from unwarranted
assumptions STOP The wisest answer to most of them, is, I think, _behold,
we know not anything_ STOP You mentioned division of labour, just now, I said STOP Surely it is
carried to a wonderful perfection in a hive of bees STOP So wonderfulso entirely super-human said the Earl, and so entirely
inconsistent with the intelligence they show in other waysthat I feel
no doubt at all that it is _pure_ Instinct, and _not_, as some hold, a
very high order of Reason STOP Look at the utter stupidity of a bee, trying
to find its way out of an open window STOP It _doesnt_ try, in any
reasonable sense of the word: it simply bangs itself about STOP We should
call a puppy _imbecile_, that behaved so STOP And yet we are asked to
believe that its intellectual level is above Sir Isaac Newton STOP Then you hold that _pure_ Instinct contains no _Reason_ at all STOP On the contrary, said the Earl, I hold that the work of a bee-hive
involves Reason of the _highest_ order STOP But none of it is done by the
_Bee_ STOP _God_ has reasoned it all out, and has put into the mind of the
Bee the _conclusions_, only, of the reasoning process STOP But how do their minds come to work _together_ STOP I asked STOP What right have we to assume that they _have_ minds STOP Special pleading, special pleading STOP Lady Muriel cried, in a most
unfilial tone of triumph STOP Why, you yourself said, just now, the mind
of the Bee STOP But I did _not_ say _minds_, my child, the Earl gently replied STOP It
has occurred to me, as the most probable solution of the Bee-mystery,
that a swarm of Bees _have only one mind among them_ STOP We often see one
mind animating a most complex collection of limbs and organs, _when
joined together_ STOP How do we know that any material connection is
necessary STOP May not mere neighbourhood be enough STOP If so, a swarm of bees
is simply a single animal whose many limbs are not quite close
together STOP It is a bewildering thought, I said, and needs a nights rest to
grasp it properly STOP Reason and Instinct _both_ tell me I ought to go
home STOP So, good-night STOP Ill set you part of the way, said Lady Muriel STOP Ive had no walk
to-day STOP It will do me good, and I have more to say to you STOP Shall we go
through the wood STOP It will be pleasanter than over the common, even
though it _is_ getting a little dark STOP We turned aside into the shade of interlacing boughs, which formed an
architecture of almost perfect symmetry, grouped into lovely groined
arches, or running out, far as the eye could follow, into endless
aisles, and chancels, and naves, like some ghostly cathedral, fashioned
out of the dream of a moon-struck poet STOP Always, in this wood, she began after a pause (silence seemed natural
in this dim solitude), I begin thinking of Fairies STOP May I ask you a
question STOP she added hesitatingly STOP Do you believe in Fairies STOP The momentary impulse was so strong to tell her of my experiences in
this very wood, that I had to make a real effort to keep back the words
that rushed to my lips STOP If you mean, by believe, believe in their
_possible_ existence, I say Yes STOP For their _actual_ existence, of
course, one would need _evidence_ STOP You were saying, the other day, she went on, that you would accept
_anything_, on good evidence, that was not _a priori_ impossible STOP And I
think you named _Ghosts_ as an instance of a _provable_ phenomenon STOP Would _Fairies_ be another instance STOP Yes, I think so STOP And again it was hard to check the wish to say more:
but I was not yet sure of a sympathetic listener STOP And have you any theory as to what sort of place they would occupy in
Creation STOP Do tell me what you think about them STOP Would they, for instance
(supposing such beings to exist), would they have any moral
responsibility STOP I mean (and the light bantering tone suddenly changed
to one of deep seriousness) would they be capable of _sin_ STOP They can reasonon a lower level, perhaps, than men and womennever
rising, I think, above the faculties of a child; and they have a moral
sense, most surely STOP Such a being, without _free will_, would be an
absurdity STOP So I am driven to the conclusion that they _are_ capable of
sin STOP You believe in them STOP she cried delightedly, with a sudden motion as if
about to clap her hands STOP Now tell me, have you any reason for it STOP And still I strove to keep back the revelation I felt sure was coming STOP I believe that there is _life_ everywherenot _material_ only, not
merely what is palpable to our sensesbut immaterial and invisible as
well STOP We believe in our own immaterial essencecall it soul, or
spirit, or what you will STOP Why should not other similar essences exist
around us, _not_ linked on to a visible and _material_ body STOP Did not God
make this swarm of happy insects, to dance in this sunbeam for one hour
of bliss, for no other object, that we can imagine, than to swell the
sum of conscious happiness STOP And where shall we dare to draw the line,
and say He has made all these and no more STOP Yes, yes STOP she assented, watching me with sparkling eyes STOP But these
are only reasons for not _denying_ STOP You have more reasons than this,
have you not STOP Well, yes, I said, feeling I might safely tell all now STOP And I could
not find a fitter time or place to say it STOP I have _seen_ themand in
this very wood STOP Lady Muriel asked no more questions STOP Silently she paced at my side, with
head bowed down and hands clasped tightly together STOP Only, as my tale
went on, she drew a little short quick breath now and then, like a child
panting with delight STOP And I told her what I had never yet breathed to
any other listener, of my double life, and, more than that (for _mine_
might have been but a noonday-dream), of the double life of those two
dear children STOP And when I told her of Brunos wild gambols, she laughed merrily; and
when I spoke of Sylvies sweetness and her utter unselfishness and
trustful love, she drew a deep breath, like one who hears at last some
precious tidings for which the heart has ached for a long while; and the
happy tears chased one another down her cheeks STOP I have often longed to meet an angel, she whispered, so low that I
could hardly catch the words STOP Im _so_ glad Ive seen Sylvie STOP My heart
went out to the child the first moment that I saw her Listen STOP she
broke off suddenly STOP Thats Sylvie singing STOP Im sure of it STOP Dont you
know her voice STOP I have heard _Bruno_ sing, more than once, I said: but I never heard
Sylvie STOP I have only heard her _once_, said Lady Muriel STOP It was that day when
you brought us those mysterious flowers STOP The children had run out into
the garden; and I saw Eric coming in that way, and went to the window to
meet him: and Sylvie was singing, under the trees, a song I had never
heard before STOP The words were something like I think it is Love, I feel
it is Love STOP Her voice sounded far away, like a dream, but it was
beautiful beyond all wordsas sweet as an infants first smile, or the
first gleam of the white cliffs when one is coming _home_ after weary
yearsa voice that seemed to fill ones whole being with peace and
heavenly thoughts Listen STOP she cried, breaking off again in her
excitement STOP That _is_ her voice, and thats the very song STOP I could distinguish no words, but there was a dreamy sense of music in
the air that seemed to grow ever louder and louder, as if coming nearer
to us STOP We stood quite silent, and in another minute the two children
appeared, coming straight towards us through an arched opening among the
trees STOP Each had an arm round the other, and the setting sun shed a
golden halo round their heads, like what one sees in pictures of saints STOP They were looking in our direction, but evidently did not see us, and I
soon made out that Lady Muriel had for once passed into a condition
familiar to _me_, that we were both of us eerie, and that, though we
could see the children so plainly, we were quite invisible to _them_ STOP [Illustration: A FAIRY-DUET]

The song ceased just as they came into sight: but, to my delight, Bruno
instantly said Lets sing it all again, Sylvie STOP It _did_ sound so
pretty STOP And Sylvie replied Very well STOP Its _you_ to begin, you know STOP So Bruno began, in the sweet childish treble I knew so well:

  Say, what is the spell, when her fledgelings are cheeping,
    That lures the bird home to her nest STOP Or wakes the tired mother, whose infant is weeping,
    To cuddle and croon it to rest STOP Whats the magic that charms the glad babe in her arms,
    Till it cooes with the voice of the dove STOP And now ensued quite the strangest of all the strange experiences that
marked the wonderful year whose history I am writingthe experience of
_first_ hearing Sylvies voice in song STOP Her part was a very short
oneonly a few wordsand she sang it timidly, and very low indeed,
scarcely audibly, but the _sweetness_ of her voice was simply
indescribable; I have never heard any earthly music like it STOP Tis a secret, and so let us whisper it low
    And the name of the secret is Love STOP On me the first effect of her voice was a sudden sharp pang that seemed
to pierce through ones very heart STOP (I had felt such a pang only once
before in my life, and it had been from _seeing_ what, at the moment,
realised ones idea of perfect beautyit was in a London exhibition,
where, in making my way through a crowd, I suddenly met, face to face, a
child of quite unearthly beauty. STOP Then came a rush of burning tears to
the eyes, as though one could weep ones soul away for pure delight STOP And
lastly there fell on me a sense of awe that was almost terrorsome such
feeling as Moses must have had when he heard the words _Put off thy
shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy
ground_ STOP The figures of the children became vague and shadowy, like
glimmering meteors: while their voices rang together in exquisite
harmony as they sang:

      For I think it is Love,
      For I feel it is Love,
  For Im sure it is nothing but Love STOP By this time I could see them clearly once more STOP Bruno again sang by
himself:

  Say, whence is the voice that, when anger is burning,
    Bids the whirl of the tempest to cease STOP That stirs the vexed soul with an achinga yearning
    For the brotherly hand-grip of peace STOP Whence the music that fills all our beingthat thrills
    Around us, beneath, and above STOP Sylvie sang more courageously, this time: the words seemed to carry her
away, out of herself:

  Tis a secret: none knows how it comes, how it goes:
    But the name of the secret is Love STOP And clear and strong the chorus rang out:

      For I think it is Love,
      For I feel it is Love,
  For Im sure it is nothing but Love STOP Once more we heard Brunos delicate little voice alone:

  Say whose is the skill that paints valley and hill,
    Like a picture so fair to the sight STOP That flecks the green meadow with sunshine and shadow,
    Till the little lambs leap with delight STOP And again uprose that silvery voice, whose angelic sweetness I could
hardly bear:

  Tis a secret untold to hearts cruel and cold,
    Though tis sung, by the angels above,
  In notes that ring clear for the ears that can hear
    And the name of the secret is Love STOP And then Bruno joined in again with

      For I think it is Love,
      For I feel it is Love,
  For Im sure it is nothing but Love STOP That _are_ pretty STOP the little fellow exclaimed, as the children passed
usso closely that we drew back a little to make room for them, and it
seemed we had only to reach out a hand to touch them: but this we did
not attempt STOP No use to try and stop them STOP I said, as they passed away into the
shadows STOP Why, they could not even _see_ us STOP No use at all, Lady Muriel echoed with a sigh STOP One would _like_ to
meet them again, in living form STOP But I feel, somehow, _that_ can never
be STOP They have passed out of _our_ lives STOP She sighed again; and no more
was said, till we came out into the main road, at a point near my
lodgings STOP Well, I will leave you here, she said STOP I want to get back before
dark: and I have a cottage-friend to visit, first STOP Good night, dear
friend STOP Let us see you soonand often STOP she added, with an affectionate
warmth that went to my very heart STOP _For those are few we hold as
dear!_

Good night STOP I answered STOP Tennyson said that of a worthier friend than
me STOP Tennyson didnt know what he was talking about STOP she saucily rejoined,
with a touch of her old childish gaiety; and we parted STOP  STOP GAMMON AND SPINACH STOP My landladys welcome had an extra heartiness about it: and though, with
a rare delicacy of feeling, she made no direct allusion to the friend
whose companionship had done so much to brighten life for me, I felt
sure that it was a kindly sympathy with my solitary state that made her
so specially anxious to do all she could think of to ensure my comfort,
and make me feel at home STOP The lonely evening seemed long and tedious: yet I lingered on, watching
the dying fire, and letting Fancy mould the red embers into the forms
and faces belonging to bygone scenes STOP Now it seemed to be Brunos
roguish smile that sparkled for a moment, and died away: now it was
Sylvies rosy cheek: and now the Professors jolly round face, beaming
with delight STOP Youre welcome, my little ones STOP he seemed to say STOP And
then the red coal, which for the moment embodied the dear old Professor,
began to wax dim, and with its dying lustre the words seemed to die away
into silence STOP I seized the poker, and with an artful touch or two
revived the waning glow, while Fancyno coy minstrel shesang me once
again the magic strain I loved to hear STOP Youre welcome, little ones STOP the cheery voice repeated STOP I told them
you were coming STOP Your rooms are all ready for you STOP And the Emperor and
the Empresswell, I think theyre rather pleased than otherwise STOP In
fact, Her Highness said I hope theyll be in time for the Banquet STOP Those were her very words, I assure you STOP Will Uggug be at the Banquet STOP Bruno asked STOP And both children looked
uneasy at the dismal suggestion STOP Why, of course he will STOP chuckled the Professor STOP Why, its his
_birthday_, dont you know STOP And his health will be drunk, and all that
sort of thing STOP What would the Banquet be without _him_ STOP Ever so much nicer, said Bruno STOP But he said it in a _very_ low voice,
and nobody but Sylvie heard him STOP The Professor chuckled again STOP Itll be a jolly Banquet, now _youve_
come, my little man STOP I _am_ so glad to see you again STOP I fraid weve been very long in coming, Bruno politely remarked STOP Well, yes, the Professor assented STOP However, youre very short now
youre come: thats _some_ comfort STOP And he went on to enumerate the
plans for the day STOP The Lecture comes first, he said STOP _That_ the
Empress _insists_ on STOP She says people will eat so much at the Banquet,
theyll be too sleepy to attend to the Lecture afterwardsand perhaps
shes right STOP Therell just be a little _refreshment_, when the people
first arriveas a kind of surprise for the Empress, you know STOP Ever since
shes beenwell, not _quite_ so clever as she once wasweve found it
desirable to concoct little surprises for her STOP _Then_ comes the
Lecture

What STOP The Lecture you were getting readyever so long ago STOP Sylvie
enquired STOP Yesthats the one, the Professor rather reluctantly admitted STOP It
_has_ taken a goodish time to prepare STOP Ive got so many other things to
attend to STOP For instance, Im Court-Physician STOP I have to keep all the
Royal Servants in good healthand that reminds me STOP he cried, ringing
the bell in a great hurry STOP This is Medicine-Day STOP We only give Medicine
once a week STOP If we were to begin giving it every day, the bottles would
_soon_ be empty STOP But if they were ill on the _other_ days STOP Sylvie suggested STOP What, ill on the wrong _day_ STOP exclaimed the Professor STOP Oh, that would
never do STOP A Servant would be dismissed _at once_, who was ill on the
wrong day STOP This is the Medicine for _today_, he went on, taking down a
large jug from a shelf STOP I mixed it, myself, first thing this morning STOP Taste it STOP he said, holding out the jug to Bruno STOP Dip in your finger,
and taste it STOP Bruno did so, and made such an excruciatingly wry face that Sylvie
exclaimed, in alarm, Oh, Bruno, you mustnt STOP Its welly extremely nasty STOP Bruno said, as his face resumed its
natural shape STOP Nasty STOP said the Professor STOP Why, of _course_ it is STOP What would
Medicine be, if it wasnt _nasty_ STOP Nice, said Bruno STOP I was going to say the Professor faltered, rather taken aback by the
promptness of Brunos reply, that _that_ would never do STOP Medicine
_has_ to be nasty, you know STOP Be good enough to take this jug, down into
the Servants Hall, he said to the footman who answered the bell: and
tell them its their Medicine for _today_ STOP Which of them is to drink it STOP the footman asked, as he carried off the
jug STOP Oh, Ive not settled _that_ yet STOP the Professor briskly replied STOP Ill
come and settle that, soon STOP Tell them not to begin, on any account, till
I come STOP Its really _wonderful_, he said, turning to the children, the
success Ive had in curing Diseases STOP Here are some of my memoranda STOP He
took down from the shelf a heap of little bits of paper, pinned together
in twos and threes STOP Just look at _this_ set, now STOP _Under-Cook Number
Thirteen recovered from Common FeverFebris Communis_ STOP And now see
whats pinned to it STOP _Gave Under-Cook Number Thirteen a Double Dose of
Medicine_ STOP _Thats_ something to be proud of, _isnt_ it STOP But which happened _first_ STOP said Sylvie, looking very much puzzled STOP The Professor examined the papers carefully STOP They are not _dated_, I
find, he said with a slightly dejected air: so I fear I cant tell
you STOP But they _both_ happened: theres no doubt of _that_ STOP The
_Medicines_ the great thing, you know STOP The _Diseases_ are much less
important STOP You can keep a _Medicine_, for years and years: but nobody
ever wants to keep a _Disease_ STOP By the way, come and look at the
platform STOP The Gardener asked me to come and see if it would do STOP We may
as well go before it gets dark STOP Wed like to, very much STOP Sylvie replied STOP Come, Bruno, put on your
hat STOP Dont keep the dear Professor waiting STOP Cant find my hat STOP the little fellow sadly replied STOP I were rolling
it about STOP And its rolled itself away STOP Maybe its rolled in _there_, Sylvie suggested, pointing to a dark
recess, the door of which stood half open: and Bruno ran in to look STOP After a minute he came slowly out again, looking very grave, and
carefully shut the cupboard-door after him STOP It arent in there, he said, with such unusual solemnity, that
Sylvies curiosity was roused STOP What _is_ in there, Bruno STOP Theres cobwebsand two spiders Bruno thoughtfully replied, checking
off the catalogue on his fingers, and the cover of a picture-bookand
a tortoiseand a dish of nutsand an old man STOP An old man STOP cried the Professor, trotting across the room in great
excitement STOP Why, it must be the Other Professor, thats been lost for
ever so long STOP [Illustration: THE OTHER PROFESSOR FOUND]

He opened the door of the cupboard wide: and there he was, the Other
Professor, sitting in a chair, with a book on his knee, and in the act
of helping himself to a nut from a dish, which he had taken down off a
shelf just within his reach STOP He looked round at us, but said nothing
till he had cracked and eaten the nut STOP Then he asked the old question STOP Is the Lecture all ready STOP Itll begin in an hour, the Professor said, evading the question STOP First, we must have something to surprise the Empress STOP And then comes
the Banquet

The Banquet STOP cried the Other Professor, springing up, and filling the
room with a cloud of dust STOP Then Id better go andand brush myself a
little STOP What a state Im in STOP He _does_ want brushing STOP the Professor said, with a critical air,
Heres your hat, little man STOP I had put it on by mistake STOP Id quite
forgotten I had _one_ on, already STOP Lets go and look at the platform STOP And theres that nice old Gardener singing still STOP Bruno exclaimed in
delight, as we went out into the garden STOP I do believe hes been singing
that very song ever since we went away STOP Why, of course he has STOP replied the Professor STOP It wouldnt be the
thing to leave off, you know STOP Wouldnt be _what_ thing STOP said Bruno: but the Professor thought it
best not to hear the question STOP What are you doing with that hedgehog STOP he shouted at the Gardener, whom they found standing upon one foot,
singing softly to himself, and rolling a hedgehog up and down with the
other foot STOP Well, I wanted fur to know what hedgehogs lives on: so I be a-keeping
this here hedgehogfur to see if it eats potatoes

Much better keep a potato, said the Professor; and see if hedgehogs
eat it STOP That be the roight way, sure-ly STOP the delighted Gardener exclaimed STOP Be
you come to see the platform STOP Aye, aye STOP the Professor cheerily replied STOP And the children have come
back, you see STOP The Gardener looked round at them with a grin STOP Then he led the way to
the Pavilion; and as he went he sang:

  He looked again, and found it was
    A Double Rule of Three:
  And all its Mystery, he said,
    Is clear as day to me STOP Youve been _months_ over that song, said the Professor STOP Isnt it
finished yet STOP There be only one verse more, the Gardener sadly replied STOP And, with
tears streaming down his cheeks, he sang the last verse:

  He thought he saw an Argument
    That proved he was the Pope:
  He looked again, and found it was
    A Bar of Mottled Soap STOP A fact so dread, he faintly said,
    Extinguishes all hope STOP Choking with sobs, the Gardener hastily stepped on a few yards ahead of
the party, to conceal his emotion STOP Did _he_ see the Bar of Mottled Soap STOP Sylvie enquired, as we followed STOP Oh, certainly STOP said the Professor STOP That song is his own history, you
know STOP Tears of an ever-ready sympathy glittered in Brunos eyes STOP Is _welly_
sorry he isnt the Pope STOP he said STOP Arent _you_ sorry, Sylvie STOP WellI hardly know, Sylvie replied in the vaguest manner STOP Would it
make him any happier STOP she asked the Professor STOP It wouldnt make the _Pope_ any happier, said the Professor STOP Isnt
the platform _lovely_ STOP he asked, as we entered the Pavilion STOP Ive put an extra beam under it STOP said the Gardener, patting it
affectionately as he spoke STOP And now its that strong, asas a mad
elephant might dance upon it STOP Thank you _very_ much STOP the Professor heartily rejoined STOP I dont know
that we shall exactly requirebut its convenient to know STOP And he led
the children upon the platform, to explain the arrangements to them STOP Here are three seats, you see, for the Emperor and the Empress and
Prince Uggug STOP But there must be two more chairs here STOP he said, looking
down at the Gardener STOP One for Lady Sylvie, and one for the smaller
animal STOP And may I help in the Lecture STOP said Bruno STOP I can do some
conjuring-tricks STOP Well, its not exactly a _conjuring_ lecture, the Professor said, as
he arranged some curious-looking machines on the table STOP However, what
can you do STOP Did you ever go through a table, for instance STOP Often STOP said Bruno STOP _Havent_ I, Sylvie STOP The Professor was evidently surprised, though he tried not to show it STOP This must be looked into, he muttered to himself, taking out a
note-book STOP And firstwhat kind of table STOP Tell him STOP Bruno whispered to Sylvie, putting his arms round her neck STOP Tell him yourself, said Sylvie STOP Cant, said Bruno STOP Its a _bony_ word STOP Nonsense STOP laughed Sylvie STOP You can say it well enough, if you only
try STOP Come STOP Muddle said Bruno STOP Thats a bit of it STOP _What_ does he say STOP cried the bewildered Professor STOP He means the multiplication-table, Sylvie explained STOP The Professor looked annoyed, and shut up his note-book again STOP Oh,
thats _quite_ another thing, he said STOP It are ever so many other things, said Bruno STOP _Arent_ it, Sylvie STOP A loud blast of trumpets interrupted this conversation STOP Why, the
entertainment has _begun_ STOP the Professor exclaimed, as he hurried the
children into the Reception-Saloon STOP I had no idea it was so late STOP A small table, containing cake and wine, stood in a corner of the
Saloon; and here we found the Emperor and Empress waiting for us STOP The
rest of the Saloon had been cleared of furniture, to make room for the
guests STOP I was much struck by the great change a few months had made in
the faces of the Imperial Pair STOP A vacant stare was now the _Emperors_
usual expression; while over the face of the _Empress_ there flitted,
ever and anon, a meaningless smile STOP So youre come at last STOP the Emperor sulkily remarked, as the Professor
and the children took their places STOP It was evident that he was _very_
much out of temper: and we were not long in learning the cause of this STOP He did not consider the preparations, made for the Imperial party, to be
such as suited their rank STOP A common mahogany table STOP he growled,
pointing to it contemptuously with his thumb STOP Why wasnt it made of
gold, I should like to know STOP It would have taken a very long the Professor began, but the Emperor
cut the sentence short STOP Then the cake STOP Ordinary plum STOP Why wasnt it made ofof He broke off
again STOP Then the wine STOP Merely old Madeira STOP Why wasnt it STOP Then this
chair STOP Thats worst of all STOP Why wasnt it a throne STOP One _might_ excuse
the other omissions, but I _cant_ get over the chair STOP What _I_ cant get over, said the Empress, in eager sympathy with her
angry husband, is the _table_ STOP Pooh STOP said the Emperor STOP It is much to be regretted STOP the Professor mildly replied, as soon as
he had a chance of speaking STOP After a moments thought he strengthened
the remark STOP _Everything_, he said, addressing Society in general, is
_very much_ to be regretted STOP A murmur of Hear, hear STOP rose from the crowded Saloon STOP There was a rather awkward pause: the Professor evidently didnt know
how to begin STOP The Empress leant forwards, and whispered to him STOP A few
jokes, you know, Professorjust to put people at their ease STOP True, true, Madam STOP the Professor meekly replied STOP This little boy

_Please_ dont make any jokes about _me_ STOP Bruno exclaimed, his eyes
filling with tears STOP I wont if youd rather I didnt, said the kind-hearted Professor STOP It
was only something about a Ships Buoy: a harmless punbut it doesnt
matter STOP Here he turned to the crowd and addressed them in a loud voice STOP Learn your As STOP he shouted STOP Your Bs STOP Your Cs STOP And your Ds STOP _Then_
youll be at your ease STOP There was a roar of laughter from all the assembly, and then a great
deal of confused whispering STOP _What_ was it he said STOP Something about
bees, I fancy STOP The Empress smiled in her meaningless way, and fanned herself STOP The poor
Professor looked at her timidly: he was clearly at his wits end again,
and hoping for another hint STOP The Empress whispered again STOP Some spinach, you know, Professor, as a surprise STOP The Professor beckoned to the Head-Cook, and said something to him in a
low voice STOP Then the Head-Cook left the room, followed by all the other
cooks STOP Its difficult to get things started, the Professor remarked to Bruno STOP When once we get started, itll go on all right, youll see STOP If oo want to startle people, said Bruno, oo should put live frogs on
their backs STOP Here the cooks all came in again, in a procession, the Head-Cook coming
last and carrying something, which the others tried to hide by waving
flags all round it STOP Nothing but flags, Your Imperial Highness STOP Nothing
but flags STOP he kept repeating, as he set it before her STOP Then all the
flags were dropped in a moment, as the Head-Cook raised the cover from
an enormous dish STOP [Illustration: HER IMPERIAL HIGHNESS IS SURPRISED! STOP What is it STOP the Empress said faintly, as she put her spy-glass to her
eye STOP Why, its _Spinach_, I declare STOP Her Imperial Highness is surprised, the Professor explained to the
attendants: and some of them clapped their hands STOP The Head-Cook made a
low bow, and in doing so dropped a spoon on the table, as if by
accident, just within reach of the Empress, who looked the other way and
pretended not to see it STOP I _am_ surprised STOP the Empress said to Bruno STOP Arent you STOP Not a bit, said Bruno STOP I heard but Sylvie put her hand over his
mouth, and spoke for him STOP Hes rather tired, I think STOP He wants the
Lecture to begin STOP I want the _supper_ to begin, Bruno corrected her STOP The Empress took up the spoon in an absent manner, and tried to balance
it across the back of her hand, and in doing this she dropped it into
the dish: and, when she took it out again, it was full of spinach STOP How
curious STOP she said, and put it into her mouth STOP It tastes just like
_real_ spinach STOP I thought it was an imitationbut I do believe its
real STOP And she took another spoonful STOP It wont be real much longer, said Bruno STOP But the Empress had had enough spinach by this time, and somehowI
failed to notice the exact processwe all found ourselves in the
Pavilion, and the Professor in the act of beginning the long-expected
Lecture STOP  STOP THE PROFESSORS LECTURE STOP In Sciencein fact, in most thingsit is usually best _to begin at the
beginning_ STOP In _some_ things, of course, its better to begin at the
_other_ end STOP For instance, if you wanted to paint a dog green, it
_might_ be best to begin with the _tail_, as it doesnt bite at _that_
end STOP And so

May _I_ help oo STOP Bruno interrupted STOP Help me to do _what_ STOP said the puzzled Professor, looking up for a
moment, but keeping his finger on the book he was reading from, so as
not to lose his place STOP To paint a dog green STOP cried Bruno STOP _Oo_ can begin wiz its _mouf_, and
Ill

No, no STOP said the Professor STOP We havent got to the _Experiments_ yet STOP And so, returning to his note-book, Ill give you the Axioms of
Science STOP After that I shall exhibit some Specimens STOP Then I shall explain
a Process or two STOP And I shall conclude with a few Experiments STOP An
_Axiom_, you know, is a thing that you accept without contradiction STOP For
instance, if I were to say Here we are!, that would be accepted
without any contradiction, and its a nice sort of remark to _begin_ a
conversation with STOP So it would be an _Axiom_ STOP Or again, supposing I were
to say Here we are not STOP _that_ would be

a fib STOP cried Bruno STOP Oh, _Bruno_ STOP said Sylvie in a warning whisper STOP Of course it would be
an _Axiom_, if the Professor said it STOP that would be accepted, if people were civil, continued the
Professor; so it would be _another_ Axiom STOP It _might_ be an Axledum, Bruno said: but it wouldnt be _true_ STOP Ignorance of Axioms, the Lecturer continued, is a great drawback in
life STOP It wastes so much time to have to say them over and over again STOP For instance, take the Axiom _Nothing is greater than itself_; that
is, _Nothing can contain itself_ STOP How often you hear people say He
was so excited, he was quite unable to contain himself, Why, _of
course_ he was unable STOP The _excitement_ had nothing to do with it STOP I say, look here, you know STOP said the Emperor, who was getting a little
restless STOP How many Axioms are you going to give us STOP At _this_ rate, we
shant get to the _Experiments_ till to-morrow-week STOP Oh, sooner than _that_, I assure you STOP the Professor replied, looking
up in alarm STOP There are only, (he referred to his notes again) only
_two_ more, that are really _necessary_ STOP Read em out, and get on to the _Specimens_, grumbled the Emperor STOP The _First_ Axiom, the Professor read out in a great hurry, consists
of these words, _Whatever is, is_ STOP And the Second consists of _these_
words, _Whatever isnt, isnt_ STOP We will now go on to the _Specimens_ STOP The first tray contains Crystals and other Things STOP He drew it towards
him, and again referred to his note-book STOP Some of the labelsowing to
insufficient adhesion Here he stopped again, and carefully examined
the page with his eyeglass STOP I cant quite read the rest of the
sentence, he said at last, but it _means_ that the labels have come
loose, and the Things have got mixed

Let _me_ stick em on again STOP cried Bruno eagerly, and began licking
them, like postage-stamps, and dabbing them down upon the Crystals and
the other Things STOP But the Professor hastily moved the tray out of his
reach STOP They _might_ get fixed to the _wrong_ Specimens, you know STOP he
said STOP Oo shouldnt have any _wrong_ peppermints in the tray STOP Bruno boldly
replied STOP _Should_ he, Sylvie STOP But Sylvie only shook her head STOP The Professor heard him not STOP He had taken up one of the bottles, and was
carefully reading the label through his eye-glass STOP Our first
Specimen he announced, as he placed the bottle in front of the other
Things, isthat is, it is called here he took it up, and examined
the label again, as if he thought it might have changed since he last
saw it, is called Aqua Puracommon waterthe fluid that cheers

Hip STOP Hip STOP Hip STOP the Head-Cook began enthusiastically STOP but _not_ inebriates STOP the Professor went on quickly, but only just in
time to check the Hooroar STOP which was beginning STOP Our second Specimen, he went on, carefully opening a small jar, is
here he removed the lid, and a large beetle instantly darted out, and
with an angry buzz went straight out of the Pavilion, isor rather, I
should say, looking sadly into the empty jar, it _was_a curious kind
of Blue Beetle STOP Did any one happen to remarkas it went pastthree blue
spots under each wing STOP Nobody had remarked them STOP Ah, well STOP the Professor said with a sigh STOP Its a pity STOP Unless you
remark that kind of thing _at the moment_, its very apt to get
overlooked STOP The _next_ Specimen, at any rate, will not fly away STOP It
isin short, or perhaps, more correctly, at _length_an _Elephant_ STOP You
will observe STOP Here he beckoned to the Gardener to come up on the
platform, and with his help began putting together what looked like an
enormous dog-kennel, with short tubes projecting out of it on both
sides STOP But weve seen _Elephants_ before, the Emperor grumbled STOP Yes, but not through a _Megaloscope_ STOP the Professor eagerly replied STOP You know you cant see a _Flea_, properly, without a
_magnifying_-glasswhat we call a _Microscope_ STOP Well, just in the same
way, you cant see an _Elephant_, properly, without a
_minimifying_-glass STOP Theres one in each of these little tubes STOP And
_this_ is a _Megaloscope_ STOP The Gardener will now bring in the next
Specimen STOP Please open _both_ curtains, down at the end there, and make
way for the Elephant STOP There was a general rush to the sides of the Pavilion, and all eyes were
turned to the open end, watching for the return of the Gardener, who had
gone away singing _He thought he saw an Elephant That practised on a
Fife!_ There was silence for a minute: and then his harsh voice was
heard again in the distance STOP _He looked again_come up, then STOP _He
looked again, and found it was_woa back STOP _and, found it was A letter
from his_make way there STOP Hes a-coming STOP [Illustration: HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ELEPHANT]

And in marched, or waddledit is hard to say which is the right wordan
Elephant, on its hind-legs, and playing on an enormous fife which it
held with its fore-feet STOP The Professor hastily threw open a large door at the end of the
Megaloscope, and the huge animal, at a signal from the Gardener, dropped
the fife, and obediently trotted into the machine, the door of which was
at once shut by the Professor STOP The Specimen is now ready for
observation STOP he proclaimed STOP It is exactly the size of the Common
Mouse_Mus Communis_ STOP There was a general rush to the tubes, and the spectators watched with
delight the minikin creature, as it playfully coiled its trunk round the
Professors extended finger, finally taking its stand upon the palm of
his hand, while he carefully lifted it out, and carried it off to
exhibit to the Imperial party STOP Isnt it a _darling_ STOP cried Bruno STOP May I stroke it, please STOP Ill
touch it _welly_ gently STOP The Empress inspected it solemnly with her eye-glass STOP It is very
small, she said in a deep voice STOP Smaller than elephants usually are, I
believe STOP The Professor gave a start of delighted surprise STOP Why, thats _true_ STOP he murmured to himself STOP Then louder, turning to the audience, Her
Imperial Highness has made a remark which is perfectly sensible STOP And a
wild cheer arose from that vast multitude STOP The next Specimen, the Professor proclaimed, after carefully placing
the little Elephant in the tray, among the Crystals and other Things,
is a _Flea_, which we will enlarge for the purposes of observation STOP Taking a small pill-box from the tray, he advanced to the Megaloscope,
and reversed all the tubes STOP The Specimen is ready STOP he cried, with his
eye at one of the tubes, while he carefully emptied the pill-box through
a little hole at the side STOP It is now the size of the Common
Horse_Equus Communis_ STOP There was another general rush, to look through the tubes, and the
Pavilion rang with shouts of delight, through which the Professors
anxious tones could scarcely be heard STOP Keep the door of the Microscope
_shut_ STOP he cried STOP If the creature were to escape, _this size_, it
would But the mischief was done STOP The door had swung open, and in
another moment the Monster had got out, and was trampling down the
terrified, shrieking spectators STOP But the Professors presence of mind did not desert him STOP Undraw those
curtains STOP he shouted STOP It was done STOP The Monster gathered its legs
together, and in one tremendous bound vanished into the sky STOP Where _is_ it STOP said the Emperor, rubbing his eyes STOP In the next Province, I fancy, the Professor replied STOP That jump would
take it at _least_ five miles STOP The next thing is to explain a Process or
two STOP But I find there is hardly room enough to operatethe smaller
animal is rather in my way

Who does he mean STOP Bruno whispered to Sylvie STOP He means _you_ STOP Sylvie whispered back STOP Hush STOP Be kind enough to moveangularlyto _this_ corner, the Professor said,
addressing himself to Bruno STOP Bruno hastily moved his chair in the direction indicated STOP Did I move
angrily enough STOP he inquired STOP But the Professor was once more absorbed
in his Lecture, which he was reading from his note-book STOP I will now explain the Process ofthe name is blotted, Im sorry to
say STOP It will be illustrated by a number ofof here he examined the
page for some time, and at last said It seems to be either
Experiments or Specimens

Let it be _Experiments_, said the Emperor STOP Weve seen plenty of
_Specimens_ STOP Certainly, certainly STOP the Professor assented STOP We will have some
Experiments STOP May _I_ do them STOP Bruno eagerly asked STOP Oh dear no STOP The Professor looked dismayed STOP I really dont know what
would happen if _you_ did them STOP Nor nobody doosnt know whatll happen if _oo_ doos them STOP Bruno
retorted STOP Our First Experiment requires a Machine STOP It has two knobsonly
_two_you can count them, if you like STOP The Head-Cook stepped forwards, counted them, and retired satisfied STOP Now you _might_ press those two knobs togetherbut thats not the way
to do it STOP Or you _might_ turn the Machine upside-downbut _thats_ not
the way to do it STOP What _are_ the way to do it STOP said Bruno, who was listening very
attentively STOP The Professor smiled benignantly STOP Ah, yes STOP he said, in a voice like
the heading of a chapter STOP The Way To Do It STOP Permit me STOP and in a moment
he had whisked Bruno upon the table STOP I divide my subject, he began,
into three parts

I think Ill get down STOP Bruno whispered to Sylvie STOP It arent nice to
be divided STOP He hasnt got a knife, silly boy STOP Sylvie whispered in reply STOP Stand
still STOP Youll break all the bottles STOP The first part is to take hold of the knobs, putting them into Brunos
hands STOP The second part is Here he turned the handle, and, with a
loud Oh!, Bruno dropped both the knobs, and began rubbing his elbows STOP The Professor chuckled in delight STOP It had a sensible effect STOP _Hadnt_
it STOP he enquired STOP No, it hadnt a _sensible_ effect STOP Bruno said indignantly STOP It were
very silly indeed STOP It jingled my elbows, and it banged my back, and it
crinkled my hair, and it buzzed among my bones STOP Im sure it _didnt_ STOP said Sylvie STOP Youre only inventing STOP Oo doosnt know nuffin about it STOP Bruno replied STOP Oo wasnt there to
see STOP Nobody cant go among my bones STOP There isnt room STOP Our Second Experiment, the Professor announced, as Bruno returned to
his place, still thoughtfully rubbing his elbows, is the production of
that seldom-seen-but-greatly-to-be-admired phenomenon, Black Light STOP You
have seen White Light, Red Light, Green Light, and so on: but never,
till this wonderful day, have any eyes but mine seen _Black Light_ STOP This
box, carefully lifting it upon the table, and covering it with a heap
of blankets, is quite full of it STOP The way I made it was thisI took a
lighted candle into a dark cupboard and shut the door STOP Of course the
cupboard was then full of _Yellow_ Light STOP Then I took a bottle of Black
ink, and poured it over the candle: and, to my delight, every atom of
the Yellow Light turned _Black_ STOP That was indeed the proudest moment of
my life STOP Then I filled a box with it STOP And nowwould any one like to get
under the blankets and see it STOP Dead silence followed this appeal: but at last Bruno said _Ill_ get
under, if it wont jingle my elbows STOP Satisfied on this point, Bruno crawled under the blankets, and, after a
minute or two, crawled out again, very hot and dusty, and with his hair
in the wildest confusion STOP What did you see in the box STOP Sylvie eagerly enquired STOP I saw _nuffin_ STOP Bruno sadly replied STOP It were too dark STOP He has described the appearance of the thing exactly STOP the Professor
exclaimed with enthusiasm STOP Black Light, and Nothing, look so extremely
alike, at first sight, that I dont wonder he failed to distinguish
them STOP We will now proceed to the Third Experiment STOP The Professor came down, and led the way to where a post had been driven
firmly into the ground STOP To one side of the post was fastened a chain,
with an iron weight hooked on to the end of it, and from the other side
projected a piece of whalebone, with a ring at the end of it STOP This is a
_most_ interesting Experiment STOP the Professor announced STOP It will need
_time_, Im afraid: but that is a trifling disadvantage STOP Now observe STOP If
I were to unhook this weight, and let go, it would fall to the ground STOP You do not deny _that_ STOP Nobody denied it STOP And in the same way, if I were to bend this piece of whalebone round
the postthusand put the ring over this hookthusit stays bent: but,
if I unhook it, it straightens itself again STOP You do not deny _that_ STOP Again, nobody denied it STOP Well, now, suppose we left things just as they are, for a long time STOP The force of the _whalebone_ would get exhausted, you know, and it would
stay bent, even when you unhooked it STOP Now, _why_ shouldnt the same
thing happen with the _weight_ STOP The _whalebone_ gets so used to being
bent, that it cant _straighten_ itself any more STOP Why shouldnt the
_weight_ get so used to being held up, that it cant _fall_ any more STOP Thats what _I_ want to know STOP Thats what _we_ want to know STOP echoed the crowd STOP How long must we wait STOP grumbled the Emperor STOP The Professor looked at his watch STOP Well, I _think_ a thousand years
will do to _begin_ with, he said STOP Then we will cautiously unhook the
weight: and, if it _still_ shows (as perhaps it will) a _slight_
tendency to fall, we will hook it on to the chain again, and leave it
for _another_ thousand years STOP Here the Empress experienced one of those flashes of Common Sense which
were the surprise of all around her STOP Meanwhile therell be time for
another Experiment, she said STOP There will _indeed_ STOP cried the delighted Professor STOP Let us return to
the platform, and proceed to the _Fourth_ Experiment STOP For this concluding Experiment, I will take a certain Alkali, or AcidI
forget which STOP Now youll see what will happen when I mix it with Some
here he took up a bottle, and looked at it doubtfully, when I mix it
withwith Something

Here the Emperor interrupted STOP Whats the _name_ of the stuff STOP he
asked STOP I dont remember the _name_, said the Professor: and the label has
come off STOP He emptied it quickly into the other bottle, and, with a
tremendous bang, both bottles flew to pieces, upsetting all the
machines, and filling the Pavilion with thick black smoke STOP I sprang to
my feet in terror, andand found myself standing before my solitary
hearth, where the poker, dropping at last from the hand of the sleeper,
had knocked over the tongs and the shovel, and had upset the kettle,
filling the air with clouds of steam STOP With a weary sigh, I betook myself
to bed STOP [Illustration: AN EXPLOSION]




                              STOP THE BANQUET STOP _Heaviness may endure for a night: but joy cometh in the morning._ The
next day found me quite another being STOP Even the memories of my lost
friend and companion were sunny as the genial weather that smiled around
me STOP I did not venture to trouble Lady Muriel, or her father, with
another call so soon: but took a walk into the country, and only turned
homewards when the low sunbeams warned me that day would soon be over STOP On my way home, I passed the cottage where the old man lived, whose face
always recalled to me the day when I first met Lady Muriel; and I
glanced in as I passed, half-curious to see if he were still living
there STOP Yes: the old man was still alive STOP He was sitting out in the porch,
looking just as he did when I first saw him at Fayfield Junctionit
seemed only a few days ago STOP Good evening STOP I said, pausing STOP Good evening, Maister STOP he cheerfully responded STOP Wont ee step in STOP I stepped in, and took a seat on the bench in the porch STOP Im glad to
see you looking so hearty, I began STOP Last time, I remember, I chanced
to pass just as Lady Muriel was coming away from the house STOP Does she

bonny face for many days together STOP Well I mind the very first time she

agoor it may be three STOP She was a bonny lassand a good lass, too STOP Eh,
but life has been rare an lonely without her STOP He covered his face in his hands: and I waited a minute or two, in
silence, for him to recover himself STOP So she says Just tak _me_ fur your Minnie STOP she says STOP Didna Minnie

and left him STOP Lady Muriel, I said softly to myself as I went
homewards, truly you know how to mak amends STOP Seated once more by my lonely fireside, I tried to recall the strange
vision of the night before, and to conjure up the face of the dear old
Professor among the blazing coals STOP That black onewith just a touch of
redwould suit him well, I thought STOP After such a catastrophe, it would
be sure to be covered with black stainsand he would say:

The result of _that_ combinationyou may have noticed?was an
_Explosion_ STOP Shall I repeat the Experiment STOP No, no STOP Dont trouble yourself STOP was the general cry STOP And we all
trooped off, in hot haste, to the Banqueting-Hall, where the feast had
already begun STOP No time was lost in helping the dishes, and very speedily every guest
found his plate filled with good things STOP I have always maintained the principle, the Professor began, that it
is a good rule to take some foodoccasionally STOP The great advantage of
dinner-parties he broke off suddenly STOP Why, actually heres the Other
Professor STOP he cried STOP And theres no place left for him STOP [Illustration: THE OTHER PROFESSORS FALL]

The Other Professor came in reading a large book, which he held close to
his eyes STOP One result of his not looking where he was going was that he
tripped up, as he crossed the Saloon, flew up into the air, and fell
heavily on his face in the middle of the table STOP _What_ a pity STOP cried the kind-hearted Professor, as he helped him up STOP It wouldnt be _me_, if I didnt trip, said the Other Professor STOP The Professor looked much shocked STOP Almost _anything_ would be better
than _that_ STOP he exclaimed STOP It never does, he added, aside to Bruno,
to be anybody else, does it STOP To which Bruno gravely replied Is got nuffin on my plate STOP The Professor hastily put on his spectacles, to make sure that the
_facts_ were all right, to begin with: then he turned his jolly round
face upon the unfortunate owner of the empty plate STOP And what would you
like next, my little man STOP Well, Bruno said, a little doubtfully, I think Ill take some
plum-pudding, pleasewhile I think of it STOP Oh, Bruno STOP (This was a whisper from Sylvie. STOP It isnt good manners to
ask for a dish before it comes STOP And Bruno whispered back But I might forget to ask for some, when it
comes, oo knowI _do_ forget things, sometimes, he added, seeing Sylvie
about to whisper more STOP And _this_ assertion Sylvie did not venture to contradict STOP Meanwhile a chair had been placed for the Other Professor, between the
Empress and Sylvie STOP Sylvie found him a rather uninteresting neighbour:
in fact, she couldnt afterwards remember that he had made more than
_one_ remark to her during the whole banquet, and that was What a
comfort a Dictionary is STOP (She told Bruno, afterwards, that she had been
too much afraid of him to say more than Yes, Sir, in reply; and that
had been the end of their conversation STOP On which Bruno expressed a very
decided opinion that _that_ wasnt worth calling a conversation at
all STOP Oo should have asked him a riddle STOP he added triumphantly STOP Why,
_I_ asked the Professor _three_ riddles STOP One was that one you asked me
in the morning, How many pennies is there in two shillings STOP And
another was Oh, Bruno STOP Sylvie interrupted STOP _That_ wasnt a
riddle STOP It _were_ STOP Bruno fiercely replied. STOP By this time a waiter had supplied Bruno with a plateful of _something_,
which drove the plum-pudding out of his head STOP Another advantage of dinner-parties, the Professor cheerfully
explained, for the benefit of any one that would listen, is that it
helps you to _see_ your friends STOP If you want to _see_ a man, offer him
something to eat STOP Its the same rule with a mouse STOP This Cats very kind to the Mouses, Bruno said, stooping to stroke a
remarkably fat specimen of the race, that had just waddled into the
room, and was rubbing itself affectionately against the leg of his
chair STOP Please, Sylvie, pour some milk in your saucer STOP Pussies ever so
thirsty STOP Why do you want _my_ saucer STOP said Sylvie STOP Youve got one yourself STOP Yes, I know, said Bruno: but I wanted _mine_ for to give it some
_more_ milk in STOP Sylvie looked unconvinced: however it seemed quite impossible for her
_ever_ to refuse what her brother asked: so she quietly filled her
saucer with milk, and handed it to Bruno, who got down off his chair to
administer it to the cat STOP The rooms very hot, with all this crowd, the Professor said to
Sylvie STOP I wonder why they dont put some lumps of ice in the grate STOP You
fill it with lumps of coal in the winter, you know, and you sit round it
and enjoy the warmth STOP How jolly it would be to fill it now with lumps of
ice, and sit round it and enjoy the coolth STOP Hot as it was, Sylvie shivered a little at the idea STOP Its very cold
_outside_, she said STOP My feet got almost frozen to-day STOP Thats the _shoemakers_ fault STOP the Professor cheerfully replied STOP How
often Ive explained to him that he _ought_ to make boots with little
iron frames under the soles, to hold lamps STOP But he never _thinks_ STOP No
one would suffer from cold, if only they would _think_ of those little
things STOP I always use hot ink, myself, in the winter STOP Very few people
ever think of _that_ STOP Yet how simple it is STOP Yes, its very simple, Sylvie said politely STOP Has the cat had enough STOP This was to Bruno, who had brought back the saucer only half-emptied STOP But Bruno did not hear the question STOP Theres somebody scratching at the
door and wanting to come in, he said STOP And he scrambled down off his
chair, and went and cautiously peeped out through the door-way STOP Who was it wanted to come in STOP Sylvie asked, as he returned to his
place STOP It were a Mouse, said Bruno STOP And it peepted in STOP And it saw the Cat STOP And it said Ill come in another day STOP And I said Oo neednt be
flightened STOP The Cats _welly_ kind to Mouses STOP And it said But Is got
some imporkant business, what I _must_ attend to STOP And it said Ill
call again to-morrow STOP And it said Give my love to the Cat STOP What a fat cat it is STOP said the Lord Chancellor, leaning across the
Professor to address his small neighbour STOP Its quite a wonder STOP It was awfully fat when it camed in, said Bruno: so it would be more
wonderfuller if it got thin all in a minute STOP And that was the reason, I suppose, the Lord Chancellor suggested,
why you didnt give it the rest of the milk STOP No, said Bruno STOP It were a betterer reason STOP I tooked the saucer up
cause it were so discontented STOP It doesnt look so to _me_, said the Lord Chancellor STOP What made you
think it was discontented STOP Cause it grumbled in its throat STOP Oh, Bruno STOP cried Sylvie STOP Why, thats the way cats show theyre
_pleased_ STOP Bruno looked doubtful STOP Its not a good way, he objected STOP Oo wouldnt
say _I_ were pleased, if I made that noise in my throat STOP What a singular boy STOP the Lord Chancellor whispered to himself: but
Bruno had caught the words STOP What do it mean to say a _singular_ boy STOP he whispered to Sylvie STOP It means _one_ boy, Sylvie whispered in return STOP And _plural_ means
two or three STOP Then Is welly glad I _is_ a singular boy STOP Bruno said with great
emphasis STOP It would be _horrid_ to be two or three boys STOP Praps they
wouldnt play with me STOP Why _should_ they STOP said the Other Professor, suddenly waking up out of
a deep reverie STOP They might be asleep, you know STOP Couldnt, if _I_ was awake, Bruno said cunningly STOP Oh, but they might indeed STOP the Other Professor protested STOP Boys dont
all go to sleep at once, you know STOP So these boysbut who are you talking
about STOP He _never_ remembers to ask that first STOP the Professor whispered to the
children STOP Why, the rest of _me_, a-course STOP Bruno exclaimed triumphantly STOP Supposing I was two or three boys STOP The Other Professor sighed, and seemed to be sinking back into his
reverie; but suddenly brightened up again, and addressed the Professor STOP Theres nothing more to be done _now_, is there STOP Well, theres the dinner to finish, the Professor said with a
bewildered smile: and the heat to bear STOP I hope youll enjoy the
dinnersuch as it is; and that you wont mind the heatsuch as it
isnt STOP The sentence _sounded_ well, but somehow I couldnt quite understand it;
and the Other Professor seemed to be no better off STOP Such as it isnt
_what_ STOP he peevishly enquired STOP It isnt as hot as it might be, the Professor replied, catching at the
first idea that came to hand STOP Ah, I see what you mean _now_ STOP the Other Professor graciously
remarked STOP Its very badly expressed, but I quite see it _now_ STOP Thirteen
minutes and a half ago, he went on, looking first at Bruno and then at
his watch as he spoke, you said this Cats very kind to the Mouses STOP It must be a singular animal STOP So it _are_, said Bruno, after carefully examining the Cat, to make
sure how many there were of it STOP But how do you know its kind to the Mousesor, more correctly
speaking, the _Mice_ STOP Cause it _plays_ with the Mouses, said Bruno; for to amuse them, oo
know STOP But that is just what I _dont_ know, the Other Professor rejoined STOP My belief is, it plays with them to _kill_ them STOP Oh, thats quite a _accident_ STOP Bruno began, so eagerly, that it was
evident he had already propounded this very difficulty to the Cat STOP It
splained all that to me, while it were drinking the milk STOP It said I
teaches the Mouses new games: the Mouses likes it ever so much STOP It said
Sometimes little accidents happens: sometimes the Mouses kills
theirselves STOP It said Is always _welly_ sorry, when the Mouses kills
theirselves STOP It said

If it was so _very_ sorry, Sylvie said, rather disdainfully, it
wouldnt _eat_ the Mouses after theyd killed themselves STOP But this difficulty, also, had evidently not been lost sight of in the
exhaustive ethical discussion just concluded STOP It said (the orator
constantly omitted, as superfluous, his own share in the dialogue, and
merely gave us the replies of the Cat) It said Dead Mouses _never_
objecks to be eaten STOP It said Theres no use wasting good Mouses STOP It
said Wifful sumfinoruvver STOP It said And oo may live to say How much
I wiss I had the Mouse that then I frew away STOP It said STOP It hadnt _time_ to say such a lot of things STOP Sylvie interrupted
indignantly STOP Oo doosnt know how Cats speaks STOP Bruno rejoined contemptuously STOP Cats
speaks _welly_ quick STOP  STOP THE PIG-TALE STOP By this time the appetites of the guests seemed to be nearly satisfied,
and even _Bruno_ had the resolution to say, when the Professor offered
him a fourth slice of plum-pudding, I thinks three helpings is enough STOP Suddenly the Professor started as if he had been electrified STOP Why, I
had nearly forgotten the most important part of the entertainment STOP The
Other Professor is to recite a Tale of a PigI mean a Pig-Tale, he
corrected himself STOP It has Introductory Verses at the beginning, and at
the end STOP It cant have Introductory Verses at the _end_, can it STOP said Sylvie STOP Wait till you hear it, said the Professor: then youll see STOP Im not
sure it hasnt some in the _middle_, as well STOP Here he rose to his feet,
and there was an instant silence through the Banqueting-Hall: they
evidently expected a speech STOP Ladies, and gentlemen, the Professor began, the Other Professor is so
kind as to recite a Poem STOP The title of it is The Pig-Tale STOP He never
recited it before STOP (General cheering among the guests. STOP He will never
recite it again STOP (Frantic excitement, and wild cheering all down the
hall, the Professor himself mounting the table in hot haste, to lead the
cheering, and waving his spectacles in one hand and a spoon in the
other. STOP Then the Other Professor got up, and began:

  Little Birds are dining
      Warily and well,
      Hid in mossy cell:
  Hid, I say, by waiters
  Gorgeous in their gaiters
      Ive a Tale to tell STOP [Illustration: TEACHING TIGRESSES TO SMILE]

  Little Birds are feeding
      Justices with jam,
      Rich in frizzled ham:
  Rich, I say, in oysters
  Haunting shady cloisters
      That is what I am STOP Little Birds are teaching
      Tigresses to smile,
      Innocent of guile:
  Smile, I say, not smirkle
  Mouth a semicircle,
      Thats the proper style STOP Little Birds are sleeping
      All among the pins,
      Where the loser wins:
  Where, I say, he sneezes
  When and how he pleases
      So the Tale begins STOP There was a Pig that sat alone
    Beside a ruined Pump:
  By day and night he made his moan
  It would have stirred a heart of stone
  To see him wring his hoofs and groan,
    Because he could not jump STOP A certain Camel heard him shout
    A Camel with a hump STOP Oh, is it Grief, or is it Gout STOP What is this bellowing about STOP That Pig replied, with quivering snout,
    Because I cannot jump STOP That Camel scanned him, dreamy-eyed STOP Methinks you are too plump STOP I never knew a Pig so wide
  That wobbled so from side to side
  Who could, however much he tried,
    Do such a thing as _jump_ STOP Yet mark those trees, two miles away,
    All clustered in a clump:
  If you could trot there twice a day,
  Nor ever pause for rest or play,
  In the far futureWho can say STOP You may be fit to jump STOP [Illustration: HORRID WAS THAT PIGS DESPAIR! STOP That Camel passed, and left him there,
    Beside the ruined Pump STOP Oh, horrid was that Pigs despair STOP His shrieks of anguish filled the air STOP He wrung his hoofs, he rent his hair,
    Because he could not jump STOP There was a Frog that wandered by
    A sleek and shining lump:
  Inspected him with fishy eye,
  And said O Pig, what makes you cry STOP And bitter was that Pigs reply,
    Because I cannot jump STOP That Frog he grinned a grin of glee,
    And hit his chest a thump
  O Pig, said, be ruled by me,
  And you shall see what you shall see STOP This minute, for a trifling fee,
    Ill teach you how to jump STOP You may be faint from many a fall,
    And bruised by many a bump:
  But, if you persevere through all,
  And practise first on something small,
  Concluding with a ten-foot wall,
    Youll find that you can jump STOP That Pig looked up with joyful start:
    Oh Frog, you _are_ a trump STOP Your words have healed my inward smart
  Come, name your fee and do your part:
  Bring comfort to a broken heart,
    By teaching me to jump STOP My fee shall be a mutton-chop,
    My goal this ruined Pump STOP Observe with what an airy flop
  I plant myself upon the top STOP Now bend your knees and take a hop,
    For thats the way to jump STOP [Illustration: THE FATAL JUMP]

  Uprose that Pig, and rushed, full whack,
    Against the ruined Pump:
  Rolled over like an empty sack,
  And settled down upon his back,
  While all his bones at once went Crack STOP It was a fatal jump STOP When the Other Professor had recited this Verse, he went across to the
fire-place, and put his head up the chimney STOP In doing this, he lost his
balance, and fell head-first into the empty grate, and got so firmly
fixed there that it was some time before he could be dragged out again STOP Bruno had had time to say I thought he wanted to see how many peoples
was up the chimbley STOP And Sylvie had said _Chimney_not chimbley STOP And Bruno had said Dont talk ubbish STOP All this, while the Other Professor was being extracted STOP You must have blacked your face STOP the Empress said anxiously STOP Let me
send for some soap STOP Thanks, no, said the Other Professor, keeping his face turned away STOP Blacks quite a respectable colour STOP Besides, soap would be no use
without water STOP Keeping his back well turned away from the audience, he went on with the
Introductory Verses:

[Illustration: BATHING CROCODILES IN CREAM]

  Little Birds are writing
      Interesting books,
      To be read by cooks:
  Read, I say, not roasted
  Letterpress, when toasted,
      Loses its good looks STOP Little Birds are playing
      Bagpipes on the shore,
      Where the tourists snore:
  Thanks STOP they cry STOP Tis thrilling STOP Take, oh take this shilling STOP Let us have no more STOP Little Birds are bathing
      Crocodiles in cream,
      Like a happy dream:
  Like, but not so lasting
  Crocodiles, when fasting,
      Are not all they seem STOP [Illustration: THAT PIG LAY STILL AS ANY STONE]

  That Camel passed, as Day grew dim
    Around the ruined Pump STOP O broken heart STOP O broken limb STOP It needs, that Camel said to him,
  Something more fairy-like and slim,
    To execute a jump STOP That Pig lay still as any stone,
    And could not stir a stump:
  Nor ever, if the truth were known,
  Was he again observed to moan,
  Nor ever wring his hoofs and groan,
    Because he could not jump STOP That Frog made no remark, for he
    Was dismal as a dump:
  He knew the consequence must be
  That he would never get his fee
  And still he sits, in miserie,
    Upon that ruined Pump STOP [Illustration: STILL HE SITS IN MISERIE]

Its a miserable story STOP said Bruno STOP It begins miserably, and it ends
miserablier STOP I think I shall cry STOP Sylvie, please lend me your
handkerchief STOP I havent got it with me, Sylvie whispered STOP Then I wont cry, said Bruno manfully STOP There are more Introductory Verses to come, said the Other Professor,
but Im hungry STOP He sat down, cut a large slice of cake, put it on
Brunos plate, and gazed at his own empty plate in astonishment STOP Where did you get that cake STOP Sylvie whispered to Bruno STOP He gived it me, said Bruno STOP But you shouldnt ask for things STOP You _know_ you shouldnt STOP I _didnt_ ask, said Bruno, taking a fresh mouthful: he _gived_ it
me STOP Sylvie considered this for a moment: then she saw her way out of it STOP Well, then, ask him to give _me_ some STOP You seem to enjoy that cake STOP the Professor remarked STOP Doos that mean munch STOP Bruno whispered to Sylvie STOP Sylvie nodded STOP It means to munch and to _like_ to munch STOP Bruno smiled at the Professor STOP I _doos_ enjoy it, he said STOP The Other Professor caught the word STOP And I hope youre enjoying
_yourself_, little Man STOP he enquired STOP Brunos look of horror quite startled him STOP No, _indeed_ I arent STOP he
said STOP The Other Professor looked thoroughly puzzled STOP Well, well STOP he said STOP Try some cowslip wine STOP And he filled a glass and handed it to Bruno STOP Drink this, my dear, and youll be quite another man STOP Who shall I be STOP said Bruno, pausing in the act of putting it to his
lips STOP Dont ask so many questions STOP Sylvie interposed, anxious to save the
poor old man from further bewilderment STOP Suppose we get the Professor to
tell us a story STOP Bruno adopted the idea with enthusiasm STOP _Please_ do STOP he cried eagerly STOP Sumfin about tigersand bumble-beesand robin-redbreasts, oo knows STOP Why should you always have _live_ things in stories STOP said the
Professor STOP Why dont you have events, or circumstances STOP Oh, _please_ invent a story like that STOP cried Bruno STOP The Professor began fluently enough STOP Once a coincidence was taking a
walk with a little accident, and they met an explanationa _very_ old
explanationso old that it was quite doubled up, and looked more like a
conundrum he broke off suddenly STOP _Please_ go on STOP both children exclaimed STOP The Professor made a candid confession STOP Its a very difficult sort to
invent, I find STOP Suppose Bruno tells one, first STOP Bruno was only too happy to adopt the suggestion STOP Once there were a Pig, and a Accordion, and two Jars of
Orange-marmalade

The _dramatis person_, murmured the Professor STOP Well, what then STOP So, when the Pig played on the Accordion, Bruno went on, one of the
Jars of Orange-marmalade didnt like the tune, and the other Jar of
Orange-marmalade did like the tuneI _know_ I shall get confused among
those Jars of Orange-marmalade, Sylvie STOP he whispered anxiously STOP I will now recite the other Introductory Verses, said the Other
Professor STOP [Illustration: BLESSED BY HAPPY STAGS]

  Little Birds are choking
      Baronets with bun,

  Taught, I say, to splinter
  Salmon in the winter
      Merely for the fun STOP Little Birds are hiding

      Gratitude and gold,
      Pale with sudden cold
  Pale, I say, and wrinkled
  When the bells have tinkled
      And the Tale is told STOP The next thing to be done, the Professor cheerfully remarked to the
Lord Chancellor, as soon as the applause, caused by the recital of the
Pig-Tale, had come to an end, is to drink the Emperors health, is it
not STOP Undoubtedly STOP the Lord Chancellor replied with much solemnity, as he
rose to his feet to give the necessary directions for the ceremony STOP Fill your glasses STOP he thundered STOP All did so, instantly STOP Drink the
Emperors health STOP A general gurgling resounded all through the Hall STOP Three cheers for the Emperor STOP The faintest possible sound followed
_this_ announcement: and the Chancellor, with admirable presence of
mind, instantly proclaimed A speech from the Emperor STOP The Emperor had begun his speech almost before the words were uttered STOP However unwilling to be Emperorsince you all wish me to be Emperoryou
know how badly the late Warden managed thingswith such enthusiasm as
you have shownhe persecuted youhe taxed you too heavilyyou know who
is fittest man to be Emperormy brother had no sense STOP How long this curious speech might have lasted it is impossible to say,
for just at this moment a hurricane shook the palace to its foundations,
bursting open the windows, extinguishing some of the lamps, and filling
the air with clouds of dust, which took strange shapes in the air, and
seemed to form words STOP But the storm subsided as suddenly as it had risenthe casements swung
into their places again: the dust vanished: all was as it had been a
minute agowith the exception of the Emperor and Empress, over whom had
come a wondrous change STOP The vacant stare, the meaningless smile, had
passed away: all could see that these two strange beings had returned to
their senses STOP The Emperor continued his speech as if there had been no interruption STOP And we have behavedmy wife and Ilike two arrant Knaves STOP We deserve no
better name STOP When my brother went away, you lost the best Warden you
ever had STOP And Ive been doing my best, wretched hypocrite that I am, to
cheat you into making me an Emperor STOP Me STOP One that has hardly got the
wits to be a shoe-black STOP The Lord Chancellor wrung his hands in despair STOP He is mad, good
people STOP he was beginning STOP But both speeches stopped suddenlyand, in
the dead silence that followed, a knocking was heard at the outer door STOP What is it STOP was the general cry STOP People began running in and out STOP The
excitement increased every moment STOP The Lord Chancellor, forgetting all
the rules of Court-ceremony, ran full speed down the hall, and in a
minute returned, pale and gasping for breath STOP  STOP THE BEGGARS RETURN STOP Your Imperial Highnesses STOP he began STOP Its the old Beggar again STOP Shall
we set the dogs at him STOP Bring him here STOP said the Emperor STOP The Chancellor could scarcely believe his ears STOP _Here_, your Imperial
Highness STOP Did I rightly understand STOP Bring him here STOP the Emperor thundered once more STOP The Chancellor
tottered down the halland in another minute the crowd divided, and the
poor old Beggar was seen entering the Banqueting-Hall STOP [Illustration: THE OLD BEGGARS RETURN]

He was indeed a pitiable object: the rags, that hung about him, were all
splashed with mud: his white hair and his long beard were tossed about
in wild disorder STOP Yet he walked upright, with a stately tread, as if
used to command: andstrangest sight of allSylvie and Bruno came with
him, clinging to his hands, and gazing at him with looks of silent love STOP Men looked eagerly to see how the Emperor would receive the bold
intruder STOP Would he hurl him from the steps of the dais STOP But no STOP To their
utter astonishment, the Emperor knelt as the beggar approached, and with
bowed head murmured Forgive us STOP Forgive us STOP the Empress, kneeling at her husbands side, meekly
repeated STOP The Outcast smiled STOP Rise up STOP he said STOP I forgive you STOP And men saw
with wonder that a change had passed over the old beggar, even as he
spoke STOP What had seemed, but now, to be vile rags and splashes of mud,
were seen to be in truth kingly trappings, broidered with gold, and
sparkling with gems STOP All knew him now, and bent low before the Elder
Brother, the true Warden STOP Brother mine, and Sister mine STOP the Warden began, in a clear voice that
was heard all through that vast hall STOP I come not to disturb you STOP Rule
on, as Emperor, and rule wisely STOP For I am chosen King of Elfland STOP To-morrow I return there, taking nought from hence, save onlysave
only his voice trembled, and with a look of ineffable tenderness, he
laid his hands in silence on the heads of the two little ones who clung
around him STOP But he recovered himself in a moment, and beckoned to the Emperor to
resume his place at the table STOP The company seated themselves againroom
being found for the Elfin-King between his two childrenand the Lord

wild confusion STOP Good gracious STOP Everybody had forgotten Prince Uggug STOP He was told of the Banquet, of course STOP said the Emperor STOP Undoubtedly STOP replied the Chancellor STOP _That_ would be the duty of the
Gold Stick in Waiting STOP Let the Gold Stick come forwards STOP the Emperor gravely said STOP The Gold Stick came forwards STOP I attended on His Imperial Fatness, was
the statement made by the trembling official STOP I told him of the Lecture
and the Banquet STOP What followed STOP said the Emperor: for the unhappy man seemed almost too
frightened to go on STOP His Imperial Fatness was graciously pleased to be sulky STOP His Imperial
Fatness was graciously pleased to box my ears STOP His Imperial Fatness was
graciously pleased to say I dont care STOP Dont-care came to a bad end, Sylvie whispered to Bruno STOP Im not
sure, but I _believe_ he was hanged STOP The Professor overheard her STOP _That_ result, he blandly remarked, was
merely a case of mistaken identity STOP Both children looked puzzled STOP Permit me to explain STOP Dont-care and Care were twin-brothers STOP Care, you know, killed the Cat STOP And they caught Dont-care by
mistake, and hanged him instead STOP And so Care is alive still STOP But hes
very unhappy without his brother STOP Thats why they say Begone, dull
Care STOP Thank you STOP Sylvie said, heartily STOP Its very extremely interesting STOP Why, it seems to explain _everything_ STOP Well, not quite _everything_, the Professor modestly rejoined STOP There
are two or three scientific difficulties

What was your general impression as to His Imperial Fatness STOP the
Emperor asked the Gold Stick STOP My impression was that His Imperial Fatness was getting more

More _what_ STOP All listened breathlessly for the next word STOP More PRICKLY STOP He must be sent for _at once_ STOP the Emperor exclaimed STOP And the Gold
Stick went off like a shot STOP The Elfin-King sadly shook his head STOP No
use, no use STOP he murmured to himself STOP Loveless, loveless STOP Pale, trembling, speechless, the Gold Stick came slowly back again STOP Well STOP said the Emperor STOP Why does not the Prince appear STOP One can easily guess, said the Professor STOP His Imperial Fatness is,
without doubt, a little preoccupied STOP Bruno turned a look of solemn enquiry on his old friend STOP What do that
word mean STOP But the Professor took no notice of the question STOP He was eagerly
listening to the Gold Sticks reply STOP Please your Highness STOP His Imperial Fatness is Not a word more could
he utter STOP The Empress rose in an agony of alarm STOP Let us go to him STOP she cried STOP And there was a general rush for the door STOP Bruno slipped off his chair in a moment STOP May we go too STOP he eagerly
asked STOP But the King did not hear the question, as the Professor was
speaking to him STOP _Preoccupied_, your Majesty STOP he was saying STOP That is
what he is, no doubt STOP May we go and see him STOP Bruno repeated STOP The King nodded assent, and the
children ran off STOP In a minute or two they returned, slowly and gravely STOP Well STOP said the King STOP Whats the matter with the Prince STOP Heswhat _you_ said, Bruno replied, looking at the Professor STOP That
hard word STOP And he looked to Sylvie for assistance STOP Porcupine, said Sylvie STOP No, no STOP the Professor corrected her STOP _Pre-occupied_, you mean STOP [Illustration: PORCUPINE! STOP No, its _porcupine_, persisted Sylvie STOP Not that other word at all STOP And please will you come STOP The house is all in an uproar STOP (And ood
better bring an uproar-glass wiz oo STOP added Bruno. STOP We got up in great haste, and followed the children upstairs STOP No one
took the least notice of _me_, but I wasnt at all surprised at this, as
I had long realised that I was quite invisible to them alleven to
Sylvie and Bruno STOP All along the gallery, that led to the Princes apartment, an excited
crowd was surging to and fro, and the Babel of voices was deafening:
against the door of the room three strong men were leaning, vainly
trying to shut itfor some great animal inside was constantly bursting
it half open, and we had a glimpse, before the men could push it back
again, of the head of a furious wild beast, with great fiery eyes and
gnashing teeth STOP Its voice was a sort of mixturethere was the roaring of
a lion, and the bellowing of a bull, and now and then a scream like a
gigantic parrot STOP There is no judging by the voice STOP the Professor cried
in great excitement STOP What is it STOP he shouted to the men at the door STOP And a general chorus of voices answered him Porcupine STOP Prince Uggug has
turned into a Porcupine STOP A new Specimen STOP exclaimed the delighted Professor STOP Pray let me go in STOP It should be labeled at once STOP But the strong men only pushed him back STOP Label it, indeed STOP Do you want
to be eaten up STOP they cried STOP Never mind about Specimens, Professor STOP said the Emperor, pushing his
way through the crowd STOP Tell us how to keep him safe STOP A large cage STOP the Professor promptly replied STOP Bring a large cage, he
said to the people generally, with strong bars of steel, and a
portcullis made to go up and down like a mouse-trap STOP Does any one happen
to have such a thing about him STOP It didnt sound a likely sort of thing for any one to have about him;
however, they brought him one directly: curiously enough, there happened
to be one standing in the gallery STOP Put it facing the opening of the door, and draw up the portcullis STOP This was done in a moment STOP Blankets now STOP cried the Professor STOP This is a most interesting
Experiment STOP There happened to be a pile of blankets close by: and the Professor had
hardly said the word, when they were all unfolded and held up like
curtains all around STOP The Professor rapidly arranged them in two rows, so
as to make a dark passage, leading straight from the door to the mouth
of the cage STOP Now fling the door open STOP This did not need to be done: the three men
had only to leap out of the way, and the fearful monster flung the door
open for itself, and, with a yell like the whistle of a steam-engine,
rushed into the cage STOP Down with the portcullis STOP No sooner said than done: and all breathed
freely once more, on seeing the Porcupine safely caged STOP The Professor rubbed his hands in childish delight STOP The Experiment has
succeeded STOP he proclaimed STOP All that is needed now is to feed it three
times a day, on chopped carrots and STOP Never mind about its food, just now STOP the Emperor interrupted STOP Let us
return to the Banquet STOP Brother, will you lead the way STOP And the old man,
attended by his children, headed the procession down stairs STOP See the
fate of a loveless life STOP he said to Bruno, as they returned to their
places STOP To which Bruno made reply, I always loved Sylvie, so Ill never
get prickly like that STOP He _is_ prickly, certainly, said the Professor, who had caught the
last words, but we must remember that, however porcupiny, he is royal
still STOP After this feast is over, Im going to take a little present to
Prince Uggugjust to soothe him, you know: it isnt pleasant living in a
cage STOP Whatll you give him for a birthday-present STOP Bruno enquired STOP A small saucer of chopped carrots, replied the Professor STOP In giving
birthday-presents, _my_ motto ischeapness STOP I should think I save forty
pounds a year by givingoh, _what_ a twinge of pain STOP What is it STOP said Sylvie anxiously STOP My old enemy STOP groaned the Professor STOP Lumbagorheumatismthat sort of
thing STOP I think Ill go and lie down a bit STOP And he hobbled out of the
Saloon, watched by the pitying eyes of the two children STOP Hell be better soon STOP the Elfin-King said cheerily STOP Brother STOP turning
to the Emperor, I have some business to arrange with you to-night STOP The
Empress will take care of the children STOP And the two Brothers went away
together, arm-in-arm STOP The Empress found the children rather sad company STOP They could talk of
nothing but the dear Professor, and what a pity hes so ill!, till
at last she made the welcome proposal Lets go and see him STOP The children eagerly grasped the hands she offered them: and we went off
to the Professors study, and found him lying on the sofa, covered up
with blankets, and reading a little manuscript-book STOP Notes on Vol STOP Three STOP he murmured, looking up at us STOP And there, on a table near him,
lay the book he was seeking when first I saw him STOP And how are you now, Professor STOP the Empress asked, bending over the
invalid STOP The Professor looked up, and smiled feebly STOP As devoted to your Imperial
Highness as ever STOP he said in a weak voice STOP All of me, that is not
Lumbago, is Loyalty STOP A sweet sentiment STOP the Empress exclaimed with tears in her eyes STOP You
seldom hear anything so beautiful as thateven in a Valentine STOP We must take you to stay at the seaside, Sylvie said, tenderly STOP Itll
do you ever so much good STOP And the Seas so grand STOP But a Mountains grander STOP said Bruno STOP What is there grand about the Sea STOP said the Professor STOP Why, you could
put it all into a teacup STOP _Some_ of it, Sylvie corrected him STOP Well, youd only want a certain number of tea-cups to hold it _all_ STOP And _then_ wheres the grandeur STOP Then as to a Mountainwhy, you could
carry it all away in a wheel-barrow, in a certain number of years STOP It wouldnt look grandthe bits of it in the wheel-barrow, Sylvie
candidly admitted STOP But when oo put it together again Bruno began STOP When youre older, said the Professor, youll know that you _cant_
put Mountains together again so easily STOP One lives and one learns, you
know STOP But it neednt be the _same_ one, need it STOP said Bruno STOP Wont it do,
if _I_ live, and if _Sylvie_ learns STOP I _cant_ learn without living STOP said Sylvie STOP But I _can_ live without learning STOP Bruno retorted STOP Oo just try me STOP What I meant, was the Professor began, looking much puzzled,
wasthat you dont know _everything_, you know STOP But I _do_ know everything I know STOP persisted the little fellow STOP I
know ever so many things STOP Everything, cept the things I _dont_ know STOP And Sylvie knows all the rest STOP The Professor sighed, and gave it up STOP Do you know what a Boojum is STOP _I_ know STOP cried Bruno STOP Its the thing what wrenches people out of
their boots STOP He means bootjack, Sylvie explained in a whisper STOP You cant wrench people out of _boots_, the Professor mildly
observed STOP Bruno laughed saucily STOP Oo _can_, though STOP Unless theyre _welly_ tight
in STOP Once upon a time there was a Boojum the Professor began, but stopped
suddenly STOP I forget the rest of the Fable, he said STOP And there was a
lesson to be learned from it STOP Im afraid I forget _that_, too STOP _Ill_ tell oo a Fable STOP Bruno began in a great hurry STOP Once there were
a Locust, and a Magpie, and a Engine-driver STOP And the Lesson is, to learn
to get up early

It isnt a bit interesting STOP Sylvie said contemptuously STOP You shouldnt
put the Lesson so soon STOP When did you invent that Fable STOP said the Professor STOP Last week STOP No STOP said Bruno STOP A deal shorter ago than that STOP Guess again STOP I cant guess, said the Professor STOP How long ago STOP Why, it isnt invented yet STOP Bruno exclaimed triumphantly STOP But I
_have_ invented a lovely one STOP Shall I say it STOP If youve _finished_ inventing it, said Sylvie STOP And let the Lesson be
to try again STOP No, said Bruno with great decision STOP The Lesson are _not_ to try
again STOP Once there were a lovely china man, what stood on the
chimbley-piece STOP And he stood, and he stood STOP And one day he tumbleded
off, and he didnt hurt his self one bit STOP Only he _would_ try again STOP And
the next time he tumbleded off, he hurted his self welly much, and
breaked off ever so much varnish STOP But how did he come back on the chimney-piece after his first tumble STOP said the Empress STOP (It was the first sensible question she had asked in
all her life. STOP _I_ put him there STOP cried Bruno STOP Then Im afraid you know something about his tumbling, said the
Professor STOP Perhaps you pushed him STOP To which Bruno replied, very seriously, Didnt pushed him _much_he
were a _lovely_ china man, he added hastily, evidently very anxious to
change the subject STOP Come, my children STOP said the Elfin-King, who had just entered the room STOP We must have a little chat together, before you go to bed STOP And he was
leading them away, but at the door they let go his hands, and ran back
again to wish the Professor good night STOP [Illustration: GOOD-NIGHT, PROFESSOR! STOP Good night, Professor, good night STOP And Bruno solemnly shook hands with
the old man, who gazed at him with a loving smile, while Sylvie bent
down to press her sweet lips upon his forehead STOP Good night, little ones STOP said the Professor STOP You may leave me nowto
ruminate STOP Im as jolly as the day is long, except when its necessary to
ruminate on some very difficult subject STOP All of me, he murmured
sleepily as we left the room, all of me, that isnt _Bonhommie_, is
Rumination STOP _What_ did he say, Bruno STOP Sylvie enquired, as soon as we were safely
out of hearing STOP I _think_ he said All of me that isnt Bone-disease is Rheumatism STOP Whatever _are_ that knocking, Sylvie STOP Sylvie stopped, and listened anxiously STOP It sounded like some one kicking
at a door STOP I _hope_ it isnt that Porcupine breaking loose STOP she
exclaimed STOP Lets go on STOP Bruno said hastily STOP Theres nuffin to wait for, oo
know STOP LIFE OUT OF DEATH STOP The sound of kicking, or knocking, grew louder every moment: and at last
a door opened somewhere near us STOP Did you say come in STOP Sir STOP my
landlady asked timidly STOP Oh yes, come in STOP I replied STOP Whats the matter STOP A note has just been left for you, Sir, by the bakers boy STOP He said he
was passing the Hall, and they asked him to come round and leave it
here STOP The note contained five words only STOP Please come at once STOP Muriel STOP A sudden terror seemed to chill my very heart STOP The Earl is ill STOP I said
to myself STOP Dying, perhaps STOP And I hastily prepared to leave the house STOP No bad news, Sir, I hope STOP my landlady said, as she saw me out STOP The
boy said as some one had arrived unexpectedly STOP I hope that is it STOP I said STOP But my feelings were those of fear rather
than of hope: though, on entering the house, I was somewhat reassured by
finding luggage lying in the entrance, bearing the initials E. L.

Its only Eric Lindon after all STOP I thought, half relieved and half
annoyed STOP Surely she need not have sent for me for _that_ STOP Lady Muriel met me in the passage STOP Her eyes were gleamingbut it was the
excitement of joy, rather than of grief STOP I have a surprise for you STOP she whispered STOP You mean that Eric Lindon is here STOP I said, vainly trying to disguise
the involuntary bitterness of my tone STOP _The funeral baked meats did
coldly furnish forth the marriage-tables_, I could not help repeating
to myself STOP How cruelly I was misjudging her STOP No, no STOP she eagerly replied STOP At leastEric _is_ here STOP But, her
voice quivered, but there is _another_ STOP No need for further question STOP I eagerly followed her in STOP There on the
bed, he laypale and wornthe mere shadow of his old selfmy old friend
come back again from the dead STOP Arthur STOP I exclaimed STOP I could not say another word STOP Yes, back again, old boy STOP he murmured, smiling as I grasped his hand STOP _He_, indicating Eric, who stood near, saved my life_He_ brought me
back STOP Next to God, we must thank _him_, Muriel, my wife STOP Silently I shook hands with Eric and with the Earl: and with one consent
we moved into the shaded side of the room, where we could talk without
disturbing the invalid, who lay, silent and happy, holding his wifes
hand in his, and watching her with eyes that shone with the deep steady
light of Love STOP He has been delirious till to-day, Eric explained in a low voice: and
even to-day he has been wandering more than once STOP But the sight of _her_
has been new life to him STOP And then he went on to tell us, in would-be
careless tonesI knew how he hated any display of feelinghow he had
insisted on going back to the plague-stricken town, to bring away a man
whom the doctor had abandoned as dying, but who _might_, he fancied,
recover if brought to the hospital: how he had seen nothing in the
wasted features to remind him of Arthur, and only recognised him when he
visited the hospital a month after: how the doctor had forbidden him to
announce the discovery, saying that any shock to the over taxed brain
might kill him at once: how he had staid on at the hospital, and nursed
the sick man by night and dayall this with the studied indifference of
one who is relating the commonplace acts of some chance acquaintance STOP And this was his _rival_ STOP I thought STOP The man who had won from him the
heart of the woman he loved STOP [Illustration: HIS WIFE KNELT DOWN AT HIS SIDE]

The sun is setting, said Lady Muriel, rising and leading the way to
the open window STOP Just look at the western sky STOP What lovely crimson
tints STOP We shall have a glorious day to-morrow We had followed her
across the room, and were standing in a little group, talking in low
tones in the gathering gloom, when we were startled by the voice of the
sick man, murmuring words too indistinct for the ear to catch STOP He is wandering again, Lady Muriel whispered, and returned to the
bedside STOP We drew a little nearer also: but no, this had none of the
incoherence of delirium STOP _What reward shall I give unto the Lord_, the
tremulous lips were saying, _for all the benefits that He hath done
unto me STOP I will receive the cup of salvation, and calland call_ but
here the poor weakened memory failed, and the feeble voice died into
silence STOP His wife knelt down at the bedside, raised one of his arms, and drew it
across her own, fondly kissing the thin white hand that lay so
listlessly in her loving grasp STOP It seemed to me a good opportunity for
stealing away without making her go through any form of parting: so,
nodding to the Earl and Eric, I silently left the room STOP Eric followed me
down the stairs, and out into the night STOP Is it Life or Death STOP I asked him, as soon as we were far enough from
the house for me to speak in ordinary tones STOP It is _Life_ STOP he replied with eager emphasis STOP The doctors are quite
agreed as to _that_ STOP All he needs now, they say, is rest, and perfect
quiet, and good nursing STOP Hes quite sure to get rest and quiet, here:
and, as for the nursing why, I think its just _possible_ (he tried
hard to make his trembling voice assume a playful tone) he may even get
fairly well nursed, in his present quarters STOP Im sure of it STOP I said STOP Thank you so much for coming out to tell me STOP And, thinking he had now said all he had come to say, I held out my hand
to bid him good night STOP He grasped it warmly, and added, turning his face
away as he spoke, By the way, there is one other thing I wanted to say STOP I thought youd like to know thatthat Im notnot in the mind I was in
when last we met STOP It isntthat I can accept Christian beliefat least,
not yet STOP But all this came about so strangely STOP And she had prayed, you
know STOP And I had prayed STOP Andand his voice broke, and I could only just
catch the concluding words, _there is a God that answers prayer!_ I
know it for certain now STOP He wrung my hand once more, and left me
suddenly STOP Never before had I seen him so deeply moved STOP So, in the gathering twilight, I paced slowly homewards, in a tumultuous
whirl of happy thoughts: my heart seemed full, and running over, with
joy and thankfulness: all that I had so fervently longed for, and prayed
for, seemed now to have come to pass STOP And, though I reproached myself,
bitterly, for the unworthy suspicion I had for one moment harboured
against the true-hearted Lady Muriel, I took comfort in knowing it had
been but a passing thought STOP Not Bruno himself could have mounted the stairs with so buoyant a step,
as I felt my way up in the dark, not pausing to strike a light in the
entry, as I knew I had left the lamp burning in my sitting-room STOP But it was no common _lamplight_ into which I now stepped, with a
strange, new, dreamy sensation of some subtle witchery that had come
over the place STOP Light, richer and more golden than any lamp could give,
flooded the room, streaming in from a window I had somehow never noticed
before, and lighting up a group of three shadowy figures, that grew
momently more distincta grave old man in royal robes, leaning back in
an easy chair, and two children, a girl and a boy, standing at his side STOP Have you the Jewel still, my child STOP the old man was saying STOP Oh, _yes_ STOP Sylvie exclaimed with unusual eagerness STOP Do you think Id
_ever_ lose it or forget it STOP She undid the ribbon round her neck, as
she spoke, and laid the Jewel in her fathers hand STOP Bruno looked at it admiringly STOP What a lovely brightness STOP he said STOP Its just like a little red star STOP May I take it in my hand STOP Sylvie nodded: and Bruno carried it off to the window, and held it aloft
against the sky, whose deepening blue was already spangled with stars STOP Soon he came running back in some excitement STOP Sylvie STOP Look here STOP he
cried STOP I can see right through it when I hold it up to the sky STOP And it
isnt red a bit: its, oh such a lovely blue STOP And the words are all
different STOP Do look at it STOP Sylvie was quite excited, too, by this time; and the two children
eagerly held up the Jewel to the light, and spelled out the legend
between them, ALL WILL LOVE SYLVIE STOP [Illustration: THE BLUE LOCKET]

Why, this is the _other_ Jewel STOP cried Bruno STOP Dont you remember,
Sylvie STOP The one you _didnt_ choose STOP Sylvie took it from him, with a puzzled look, and held it, now up to the
light, now down STOP Its blue, _one_ way, she said softly to herself,
and its red, the _other_ way STOP Why, I thought there were _two_ of
themFather STOP she suddenly exclaimed, laying the Jewel once more in his
hand, I do believe it was the _same_ Jewel all the time STOP Then you choosed it from _itself_, Bruno thoughtfully remarked STOP Father, _could_ Sylvie choose a thing from itself STOP Yes, my own one, the old man replied to Sylvie, not noticing Brunos
embarrassing question, it _was_ the same Jewelbut you chose quite
right STOP And he fastened the ribbon round her neck again STOP SYLVIE WILL LOVE ALLALL WILL LOVE SYLVIE, Bruno murmured, raising
himself on tiptoe to kiss the little red star STOP And, when you look
_at_ it, its red and fierce like the sunand, when you look _through_
it, its gentle and blue like the sky STOP Gods own sky, Sylvie said, dreamily STOP Gods own sky, the little fellow repeated, as they stood, lovingly
clinging together, and looking out into the night STOP But oh, Sylvie, what

    Mary STOP THE SET, TEN VOLUMES, IN BOX, $10.00 STOP It seems to me not at all easier to draw a lifelike child than to draw
a lifelike man or woman: Shakespeare and Webster were the only two men
of their age who could do it with perfect delicacy and success; at
least, it there was another who could, I must crave pardon of his happy
memory for my forgetfulness or ignorance of his name STOP Our own age is
more fortunate, on this single score at least, having a larger and far
nobler proportion of female writers; among whom, since the death of
George Eliot, there is none left whose touch is so exquisite and
masterly, whose love is so thoroughly according to knowledge, whose
bright and sweet invention is so fruitful, so truthful, or so delightful
as Mrs. Molesworths STOP Any chapter of _The Cuckoo Clock_ or the
enchanting _Adventures of Herr Baby_ is worth a shoal of the very best
novels dealing with the characters and fortunes of mere adults.Mrs STOP A.
C. Swinburne, in _The Nineteenth Century_ STOP MRS. MOLESWORTHS

Mrs. Molesworth STOP I cannot easily speak too highly of her work STOP It is a
curious art she has, not wholly English in its spirit, but a cross of
the old English with the Italian STOP Indeed, I should say Mrs. Molesworth

way, catching and holding the spirit of all, created a method and tone
quite her own... STOP Her characters are admirable and real._St STOP Louis

the ease which comes of continuous practice._Mail and Express._

Christmas would hardly be Christmas without one of Mrs. Molesworths
stories STOP No one has quite the same power of throwing a charm and an

for them are always charmingly interesting and healthful in
tone._Boston Home Journal._

adventures of two lovable English children lost in Paris, and is just
wonderful enough to pleasantly wring the youthful heart._New York

It is, in its way, indeed, a little classic, of which the real beauty
and pathos can hardly be appreciated by young people... STOP It is not too
much to say of the story that it is perfect of its kind._Critic and

This is a charming little juvenile story from the pen of Mrs.
Molesworth, detailing the various adventures of a couple of motherless

children, whether we consider its capacity to awaken interest or its
wholesomeness._Evening Post._

Christmas-trees are supposed to most abound STOP There is just enough of the

favorites with children of all ages, and they are as good and wholesome
as they are interesting and popular STOP This makes a very handsome book,

atmosphere, and teaches a wholesome moral in the most winning
manner._B STOP S. E. Gazette._

_The Children of the Castle_ are delightful creations, actual little
girls, living in an actual castle, but often led by their fancies into a
shadowy fairy-land STOP There is a charming refinement of style and spirit
about the story from beginning to end; an imaginative child will find
endless pleasure in it, and the lesson of gentleness and unselfishness
is so artistically managed that it does not seem like a lesson, but only
a part of the story._Milwaukee Sentinel._

child that has seen the light this many a day STOP It is full of fancy and
of that instinctive sympathy with childhood which makes this authors
books so attractive and so individual._Boston Courier._

of the _Four Winds Farm_ STOP It is neither a dream nor a fairy story, but
concerns the fortune of a real little boy, named Gratian; yet the dream
and the fairy tale seem to enter into his life, and make part of it STOP The
farmhouse in which the child lives is set exactly at the meeting-place
of the four winds, and they, from the moment of his birth, have acted as
his self-elected godmothers.... All the winds love the boy, and, held in
the balance of their influence, he grows up as a boy should, simply and
truly, with a tender heart and firm mind STOP The idea of this little book
is essentially poetical._Literary World._


                       NURSE HEATHERDALES STORY STOP _Nurse Heatherdales Story_ is all about a small boy, who was good
enough, yet was always getting into some trouble through complications

PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION STOP The chief alterations, since the First Edition, have been made in the
Chapter on 'Classification' (pp STOP 2, 3) and the Book on 'Propositions'
(pp STOP 10 to 19) STOP The chief additions have been the questions on words and
phrases, added to the Examination-Papers at p. 94, and the Notes
inserted at pp STOP 164, 194 STOP In Book I, , I have adopted a new definition of
'Classification', which enables me to regard the whole Universe as a
'Class,' and thus to dispense with the very awkward phrase 'a Set of
Things. STOP In the Chapter on 'Propositions of Existence' I have adopted a new
'normal form,' in which the Class, whose existence is affirmed or
denied, is regarded as the _Predicate_, instead of the _Subject_, of the
Proposition, thus evading a very subtle difficulty which besets the
other form STOP These subtle difficulties seem to lie at the root of every
Tree of Knowledge, and they are _far_ more hopeless to grapple with than
any that occur in its higher branches STOP For example, the difficulties of
the Forty-Seventh Proposition of Euclid are mere child's play compared
with the mental torture endured in the effort to think out the essential
nature of a straight Line STOP And, in the present work, the difficulties of
the "5 Liars" Problem, at p. 192, are "trifles, light as air," compared
with the bewildering question "What is a Thing? STOP In the Chapter on 'Propositions of Relation' I have inserted a new
Section, containing the proof that a Proposition, beginning with "All,"
is a _Double_ Proposition (a fact that is quite independent of the
arbitrary rule, laid down in the next Section, that such a Proposition
is to be understood as implying the actual _existence_ of its Subject) STOP This proof was given, in the earlier editions, incidentally, in the
course of the discussion of the Biliteral Diagram: but its _proper_
place, in this treatise, is where I have now introduced it STOP pg-ix
In the Sorites-Examples, I have made a good many verbal alterations, in
order to evade a difficulty, which I fear will have perplexed some of
the Readers of the first three Editions STOP Some of the Premisses were so
worded that their Terms were not Specieses of the Univ STOP named in the
Dictionary, but of a larger Class, of which the Univ STOP was only a
portion STOP In all such cases, it was intended that the Reader should
perceive that what was asserted of the larger Class was thereby asserted
of the Univ., and should ignore, as superfluous, all that it asserted of
its _other_ portion STOP Thus, in Ex STOP 15, the Univ STOP was stated to be "ducks
in this village," and the third Premiss was "Mrs STOP Bond has no gray
ducks," i.e STOP "No gray ducks are ducks belonging to Mrs STOP Bond. STOP Here the
Terms are _not_ Specieses of the Univ., but of the larger Class "ducks,"
of which the Univ STOP is only a portion: and it was intended that the
Reader should perceive that what is here asserted of "ducks" is thereby
asserted of "ducks in this village. STOP and should treat this Premiss as if
it were "Mrs STOP Bond has no gray ducks in this village," and should
ignore, as superfluous, what it asserts as to the _other_ portion of the
Class "ducks," viz STOP "Mrs STOP Bond has no gray ducks _out of_ this village" STOP In the Appendix I have given a new version of the Problem of the "Five
Liars. STOP My object, in doing so, is to escape the subtle and mysterious
difficulties which beset all attempts at regarding a Proposition as
being its own Subject, or a Set of Propositions as being Subjects for
one another STOP It is certainly, a most bewildering and unsatisfactory
theory: one cannot help feeling that there is a great lack of
_substance_ in all this shadowy host----that, as the procession of
phantoms glides before us, there is not _one_ that we can pounce upon,
and say "_Here_ is a Proposition that _must_ be either true or
false! STOP ----that it is but a Barmecide Feast, to which we have been
bidden----and that its prototype is to be found in that mythical island,
whose inhabitants "earned a precarious living by taking in each others'
washing" STOP By simply translating "telling 2 Truths" into "taking _both_
of 2 condiments (salt and mustard)," "telling 2 Lies" into "taking
_neither_ of them" and "telling a Truth and a Lie (order not specified)"
into "taking only _one_ condiment (it is not specified _which_)," I have
escaped all those metaphysical puzzles, and have produced a Problem
which, when translated into a Set of symbolized Premisses, furnishes the
very same _Data_ as were furnished by the Problem of the "Five Liars. STOP pg-x
The coined words, introduced in previous editions, such as "Eliminands"
and "Retinends", perhaps hardly need any apology: they were
indispensable to my system: but the new plural, here used for the first
time, viz STOP "Soriteses", will, I fear, be condemned as "bad English",
unless I say a word in its defence STOP We have _three_ singular nouns, in
English, of plural _form_, "series", "species", and "Sorites": in all
three, the awkwardness, of using the same word for both singular and
plural, must often have been felt: this has been remedied, in the case
of "series" by coining the plural "serieses", which has already found
its way into the dictionaries: so I am no rash innovator, but am merely
"following suit", in using the new plural "Soriteses" STOP In conclusion, let me point out that even those, who are obliged to
study _Formal_ Logic, with a view to being able to answer
Examination-Papers in that subject, will find the study of _Symbolic_
Logic most helpful for this purpose, in throwing light upon many of the
obscurities with which Formal Logic abounds, and in furnishing a
delightfully easy method of _testing_ the results arrived at by the
cumbrous processes which Formal Logic enforces upon its votaries STOP This is, I believe, the very first attempt (with the exception of my own
little book, _The Game of Logic_, published in 1886, a very incomplete
performance) that has been made to _popularise_ this fascinating
subject STOP It has cost me _years_ of hard work: but if it should prove, as
I hope it may, to be of _real_ service to the young, and to be taken up,
in High Schools and in private families, as a valuable addition to their
stock of healthful mental recreations, such a result would more than
repay ten times the labour that I have expended on it STOP L. C.

Appendix, at p STOP 165. STOP The Learner, who wishes to try the question _fairly_, whether this
little book does, or does not, supply the materials for a most
interesting mental recreation, is _earnestly_ advised to adopt the
following Rules:--

(1) Begin at the _beginning_, and do not allow yourself to gratify a
mere idle curiosity by dipping into the book, here and there STOP This would
very likely lead to your throwing it aside, with the remark "This is
_much_ too hard for me STOP ", and thus losing the chance of adding a very
_large_ item to your stock of mental delights STOP This Rule (of not
_dipping_) is very _desirable_ with _other_ kinds of books----such as
novels, for instance, where you may easily spoil much of the enjoyment
you would otherwise get from the story, by dipping into it further on,
so that what the author meant to be a pleasant surprise comes to you as
a matter of course STOP Some people, I know, make a practice of looking into
Vol STOP III first, just to see how the story ends: and perhaps it _is_ as
well just to know that all ends _happily_----that the much-persecuted
lovers _do_ marry after all, that he is proved to be quite innocent of
the murder, that the wicked cousin is completely foiled in his plot and
gets the punishment he deserves, and that the rich uncle in India (_Qu._
Why in _India_ STOP _Ans._ Because, somehow, uncles never _can_ get rich
anywhere else) dies at exactly the right moment----before taking the
trouble to read Vol STOP I STOP This, I say, is _just_ permissible with a
_novel_, where Vol STOP III has a _meaning_, even for those who have not
read the earlier part of the story; but, with a _scientific_ book, it is
sheer insanity: you will find the latter part _hopelessly_
unintelligible, if you read it before reaching it in regular course STOP pg-xii
(2) Don't begin any fresh Chapter, or Section, until you are certain
that you _thoroughly_ understand the whole book _up to that point_, and
that you have worked, correctly, most if not all of the examples which
have been set STOP So long as you are conscious that all the land you have
passed through is absolutely _conquered_, and that you are leaving no
unsolved difficulties _behind_ you, which will be sure to turn up again
later on, your triumphal progress will be easy and delightful STOP Otherwise, you will find your state of puzzlement get worse and worse as
you proceed, till you give up the whole thing in utter disgust STOP (3) When you come to any passage you don't understand, _read it again_:
if you _still_ don't understand it, _read it again_: if you fail, even
after _three_ readings, very likely your brain is getting a little
tired STOP In that case, put the book away, and take to other occupations,
and next day, when you come to it fresh, you will very likely find that
it is _quite_ easy STOP (4) If possible, find some genial friend, who will read the book along
with you, and will talk over the difficulties with you STOP _Talking_ is a
wonderful smoother-over of difficulties STOP When _I_ come upon
anything----in Logic or in any other hard subject----that entirely
puzzles me, I find it a capital plan to talk it over, _aloud_, even when
I am all alone STOP One can explain things so _clearly_ to one's self STOP And
then, you know, one is so _patient_ with one's self: one _never_ gets
irritated at one's own stupidity STOP If, dear Reader, you will faithfully observe these Rules, and so give my
little book a really _fair_ trial, I promise you, most confidently, that
you will find Symbolic Logic to be one of the most, if not _the_ most,
fascinating of mental recreations STOP In this First Part, I have carefully
avoided all difficulties which seemed to me to be beyond the grasp of an
intelligent child of (say) twelve or fourteen years of age STOP I have
myself taught most of its contents, _viva voce_, to _many_ children, and
have found them take a real intelligent interest in the subject STOP For
those, who succeed in mastering Part I, and who begin, like Oliver,
"asking for more," I hope to provide, in Part II, some _tolerably_ hard
nuts to crack----nuts that will require all the nut-crackers they happen
to possess STOP pg-xiii
Mental recreation is a thing that we all of us need for our mental
health; and you may get much healthy enjoyment, no doubt, from Games,
such as Back-gammon, Chess, and the new Game "Halma" STOP But, after all,
when you have made yourself a first-rate player at any one of these
Games, you have nothing real to _show_ for it, as a _result!_ You
enjoyed the Game, and the victory, no doubt, _at the time_: but you have
no _result_ that you can treasure up and get real _good_ out of STOP And,
all the while, you have been leaving unexplored a perfect _mine_ of
wealth STOP Once master the machinery of Symbolic Logic, and you have a
mental occupation always at hand, of absorbing interest, and one that
will be of real _use_ to you in _any_ subject you may take up STOP It will
give you clearness of thought----the ability to _see your way_ through a
puzzle----the habit of arranging your ideas in an orderly and
get-at-able form----and, more valuable than all, the power to detect
_fallacies_, and to tear to pieces the flimsy illogical arguments, which
you will so continually encounter in books, in newspapers, in speeches,
and even in sermons, and which so easily delude those who have never
taken the trouble to master this fascinating Art STOP _Try it._ That is all
I ask of you STOP L. C.

BOOK I STOP THINGS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES STOP  STOP _INTRODUCTORY._


The Universe contains '=Things=. STOP [For example, "I," "London," "roses," "redness," "old English
    books," "the letter which I received yesterday." STOP Things have '=Attributes=. STOP [For example, "large," "red," "old," "which I received
    yesterday." STOP One Thing may have many Attributes; and one Attribute may belong to many
Things STOP [Thus, the Thing "a rose" may have the Attributes "red,"
    "scented," "full-blown," &c.; and the Attribute "red" may belong
    to the Things "a rose," "a brick," "a ribbon," &c.]

Any Attribute, or any Set of Attributes, may be called an '=Adjunct=. STOP [This word is introduced in order to avoid the constant
    repetition of the phrase "Attribute or Set of Attributes. STOP Thus, we may say that a rose has the Attribute "red" (or the
    Adjunct "red," whichever we prefer); or we may say that it has
    the Adjunct "red, scented and full-blown." STOP pg001 1/2

 STOP _CLASSIFICATION._


'Classification,' or the formation of Classes, is a Mental Process, in
which we imagine that we have put together, in a group, certain Things STOP Such a group is called a '=Class=. STOP This Process may be performed in three different ways, as follows:--

(1) We may imagine that we have put together all Things STOP The Class so
formed (i.e STOP the Class "Things") contains the whole Universe STOP (2) We may think of the Class "Things," and may imagine that we have
picked out from it all the Things which possess a certain Adjunct _not_
possessed by the whole Class STOP This Adjunct is said to be '=peculiar=' to
the Class so formed STOP In this case, the Class "Things" is called a
'=Genus=' with regard to the Class so formed: the Class, so formed, is
called a '=Species=' of the Class "Things": and its peculiar Adjunct is
called its '=Differentia=' STOP pg002
As this Process is entirely _Mental_, we can perform it whether there
_is_, or _is not_, an _existing_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct STOP If
there _is_, the Class is said to be '=Real='; if not, it is said to be
'=Unreal=', or '=Imaginary=. STOP [For example, we may imagine that we have picked out, from the
    Class "Things," all the Things which possess the Adjunct
    "material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets"; and we
    may thus form the Real Class "towns. STOP Here we may regard
    "Things" as a _Genus_, "Towns" as a _Species_ of Things, and
    "material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets" as its
    _Differentia_ STOP Again, we may imagine that we have picked out all the Things
    which possess the Adjunct "weighing a ton, easily lifted by a
    baby"; and we may thus form the _Imaginary_ Class "Things that
    weigh a ton and are easily lifted by a baby." STOP (3) We may think of a certain Class, _not_ the Class "Things," and may
imagine that we have picked out from it all the Members of it which
possess a certain Adjunct _not_ possessed by the whole Class STOP This
Adjunct is said to be '=peculiar=' to the smaller Class so formed STOP In
this case, the Class thought of is called a '=Genus=' with regard to the
smaller Class picked out from it: the smaller Class is called a
'=Species=' of the larger: and its peculiar Adjunct is called its
'=Differentia=' STOP [For example, we may think of the Class "towns," and imagine
    that we have picked out from it all the towns which possess the
    Attribute "lit with gas"; and we may thus form the Real Class
    "towns lit with gas. STOP Here we may regard "Towns" as a _Genus_,
    "Towns lit with gas" as a _Species_ of Towns, and "lit with gas"
    as its _Differentia_ STOP If, in the above example, we were to alter "lit with gas" into
    "paved with gold," we should get the _Imaginary_ Class "towns
    paved with gold." STOP A Class, containing only _one_ Member is called an '=Individual=. STOP [For example, the Class "towns having four million inhabitants,"
    which Class contains only _one_ Member, viz STOP "London." STOP pg002 1/2
Hence, any single Thing, which we can name so as to distinguish it from
all other Things, may be regarded as a one-Member Class STOP [Thus "London" may be regarded as the one-Member Class, picked
    out from the Class "towns," which has, as its Differentia,
    "having four million inhabitants." STOP A Class, containing two or more Members, is sometimes regarded as _one
single Thing_ STOP When so regarded, it may possess an Adjunct which is
_not_ possessed by any Member of it taken separately STOP [Thus, the Class "The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment," when
    regarded as _one single Thing_, may possess the Attribute
    "formed in square," which is _not_ possessed by any Member of it
    taken separately. STOP pg003

 STOP _DIVISION._


Sec STOP 1 STOP _Introductory._

'Division' is a Mental Process, in which we think of a certain Class of
Things, and imagine that we have divided it into two or more smaller
Classes STOP [Thus, we might think of the Class "books," and imagine that we
    had divided it into the two smaller Classes "bound books" and
    "unbound books," or into the three Classes, "books priced at
    less than a shilling," "shilling-books," "books priced at more
    than a shilling," or into the twenty-six Classes, "books whose
    names begin with _A_," "books whose names begin with _B_," &c.]

A Class, that has been obtained by a certain Division, is said to be
'codivisional' with every Class obtained by that Division STOP [Thus, the Class "bound books" is codivisional with each of the
    two Classes, "bound books" and "unbound books. STOP Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been
    "contemporary" with every event that happened in 1815. STOP Hence a Class, obtained by Division, is codivisional with itself STOP [Thus, the Class "bound books" is codivisional with itself STOP Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been
    "contemporary" with itself. STOP pg003 1/2
Sec STOP 2 STOP _Dichotomy._

If we think of a certain Class, and imagine that we have picked out from
it a certain smaller Class, it is evident that the _Remainder_ of the
large Class does _not_ possess the Differentia of that smaller Class STOP Hence it may be regarded as _another_ smaller Class, whose Differentia
may be formed, from that of the Class first picked out, by prefixing the
word "not"; and we may imagine that we have _divided_ the Class first
thought of into _two_ smaller Classes, whose Differentiae are
_contradictory_ STOP This kind of Division is called '=Dichotomy=' STOP [For example, we may divide "books" into the two Classes whose
    Differentiae are "old" and "not-old." STOP In performing this Process, we may sometimes find that the Attributes we
have chosen are used so loosely, in ordinary conversation, that it is
not easy to decide _which_ of the Things belong to the one Class and
_which_ to the other STOP In such a case, it would be necessary to lay down
some arbitrary _rule_, as to _where_ the one Class should end and the
other begin STOP [Thus, in dividing "books" into "old" and "not-old," we may say
    "Let all books printed before A.D. 1801, be regarded as 'old,'
    and all others as 'not-old'." STOP Henceforwards let it be understood that, if a Class of Things be divided
into two Classes, whose Differentiae have contrary meanings, each
Differentia is to be regarded as equivalent to the other with the word
"not" prefixed STOP [Thus, if "books" be divided into "old" and "new" the Attribute
    "old" is to be regarded as equivalent to "not-new," and the
    Attribute "new" as equivalent to "not-old." STOP pg004
After dividing a Class, by the Process of _Dichotomy_, into two smaller
Classes, we may sub-divide each of these into two still smaller Classes;
and this Process may be repeated over and over again, the number of
Classes being doubled at each repetition STOP [For example, we may divide "books" into "old" and "new" (i.e STOP "_not_-old"): we may then sub-divide each of these into
    "English" and "foreign" (i.e STOP "_not_-English"), thus getting
    _four_ Classes, viz STOP (1) old English;
        (2) old foreign;
        (3) new English;
        (4) new foreign STOP If we had begun by dividing into "English" and "foreign," and
    had then sub-divided into "old" and "new," the four Classes
    would have been

        (1) English old;
        (2) English new;
        (3) foreign old;
        (4) foreign new STOP The Reader will easily see that these are the very same four
    Classes which we had before. STOP pg004 1/2

 STOP _NAMES._


The word "Thing", which conveys the idea of a Thing, _without_ any idea
of an Adjunct, represents _any_ single Thing STOP Any other word (or
phrase), which conveys the idea of a Thing, _with_ the idea of an
Adjunct represents _any_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct; i.e., it
represents any Member of the Class to which that Adjunct is _peculiar_ STOP Such a word (or phrase) is called a '=Name='; and, if there be an
existing Thing which it represents, it is said to be a Name of that
Thing STOP [For example, the words "Thing," "Treasure," "Town," and the
    phrases "valuable Thing," "material artificial Thing consisting
    of houses and streets," "Town lit with gas," "Town paved with
    gold," "old English Book." STOP Just as a Class is said to be _Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there
_is_, or _is not_, an existing Thing in it, so also a Name is said to be
_Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there _is_, or _is not_, an existing
Thing represented by it STOP [Thus, "Town lit with gas" is a _Real_ Name: "Town paved with
    gold" is an _Unreal_ Name. STOP Every Name is either a Substantive only, or else a phrase consisting of
a Substantive and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as
Adjectives) STOP Every Name, except "Thing", may usually be expressed in three different
forms:--

    (_a_) The Substantive "Thing", and one or more
    Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives) conveying
    the ideas of the Attributes;
                                                                   pg005
    (_b_) A Substantive, conveying the idea of a Thing with
    the ideas of _some_ of the Attributes, and one or more
    Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives) conveying
    the ideas of the _other_ Attributes;

    (_c_) A Substantive conveying the idea of a Thing with
    the ideas of _all_ the Attributes STOP [Thus, the phrase "material living Thing, belonging to the
    Animal Kingdom, having two hands and two feet" is a Name
    expressed in Form (_a_) STOP If we choose to roll up together the Substantive "Thing" and the
    Adjectives "material, living, belonging to the Animal Kingdom,"
    so as to make the new Substantive "Animal," we get the phrase
    "Animal having two hands and two feet," which is a Name
    (representing the same Thing as before) expressed in Form (_b_) STOP And, if we choose to roll up the whole phrase into one word, so
    as to make the new Substantive "Man," we get a Name (still
    representing the very same Thing) expressed in Form (_c_). STOP A Name, whose Substantive is in the _plural_ number, may be used to
represent either

    (1) Members of a Class, _regarded as separate Things_;
    or (2) a whole Class, _regarded as one single Thing_ STOP [Thus, when I say "Some soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are
    tall," or "The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are brave," I am
    using the Name "soldiers of the Tenth Regiment" in the _first_
    sense; and it is just the same as if I were to point to each of
    them _separately_, and to say "_This_ soldier of the Tenth
    Regiment is tall," "_That_ soldier of the Tenth Regiment is
    tall," and so on STOP But, when I say "The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are formed
    in square," I am using the phrase in the _second_ sense; and it
    is just the same as if I were to say "The _Tenth Regiment_ is
    formed in square." STOP pg006

 STOP _DEFINITIONS._


It is evident that every Member of a _Species_ is _also_ a Member of the
_Genus_ out of which that Species has been picked, and that it possesses
the _Differentia_ of that Species STOP Hence it may be represented by a Name
consisting of two parts, one being a Name representing any Member of the
_Genus_, and the other being the _Differentia_ of that Species STOP Such a
Name is called a '=Definition=' of any Member of that Species, and to
give it such a Name is to '=define=' it STOP [Thus, we may define a "Treasure" as a "valuable Thing. STOP In this
    case we regard "Things" as the _Genus_, and "valuable" as the
    _Differentia_. STOP The following Examples, of this Process, may be taken as models for
working others STOP [Note that, in each Definition, the Substantive, representing a
    Member (or Members) of the _Genus_, is printed in Capitals. STOP 1 STOP Define "a Treasure. STOP _Ans._ "a valuable THING. STOP 2 STOP Define "Treasures. STOP _Ans._ "valuable THINGS. STOP 3 STOP Define "a Town. STOP _Ans._ "a material artificial THING, consisting of houses and streets. STOP pg007
4 STOP Define "Men. STOP _Ans._ "material, living THINGS, belonging to the Animal Kingdom, having
two hands and two feet";

or else

"ANIMALS having two hands and two feet. STOP 5 STOP Define "London. STOP _Ans._ "the material artificial THING, which consists of houses and
streets, and has four million inhabitants";

or else

"the TOWN which has four million inhabitants. STOP [Note that we here use the article "the" instead of "a", because
    we happen to know that there is only _one_ such Thing STOP The Reader can set himself any number of Examples of this
    Process, by simply choosing the Name of any common Thing (such
    as "house," "tree," "knife"), making a Definition for it, and
    then testing his answer by referring to any English Dictionary. STOP pg008


BOOK II STOP PROPOSITIONS STOP  STOP _PROPOSITIONS GENERALLY._


Sec STOP 1 STOP _Introductory._

Note that the word "some" is to be regarded, henceforward, as meaning
"one or more. STOP The word 'Proposition,' as used in ordinary conversation, may be applied
to _any_ word, or phrase, which conveys any information whatever STOP [Thus the words "yes" and "no" are Propositions in the ordinary
    sense of the word; and so are the phrases "you owe me five
    farthings" and "I don't! STOP Such words as "oh! STOP or "never STOP ", and such phrases as "fetch me
    that book! STOP "which book do you mean? STOP do not seem, at first
    sight, to convey any _information_; but they can easily be
    turned into equivalent forms which do so, viz STOP "I am surprised,"
    "I will never consent to it," "I order you to fetch me that
    book," "I want to know which book you mean." STOP But a '=Proposition=,' as used in this First Part of "Symbolic Logic,"
has a peculiar form, which may be called its '=Normal form='; and if any
Proposition, which we wish to use in an argument, is not in normal form,
we must reduce it to such a form, before we can use it STOP pg009
A '=Proposition=,' when in normal form, asserts, as to certain two
Classes, which are called its '=Subject=' and '=Predicate=,' either

    (1) that _some_ Members of its Subject are Members
    of its Predicate;

    or (2) that _no_ Members of its Subject are Members
    of its Predicate;

    or (3) that _all_ Members of its Subject are Members
    of its Predicate STOP The Subject and the Predicate of a Proposition are called its '=Terms=. STOP Two Propositions, which convey the _same_ information, are said to be
'=equivalent=' STOP [Thus, the two Propositions, "I see John" and "John is seen by
    me," are equivalent. STOP Sec STOP 2 STOP _Normal form of a Proposition._

A Proposition, in normal form, consists of four parts, viz.--

    (1) The word "some," or "no," or "all. STOP (This word,
    which tells us _how many_ Members of the Subject
    are also Members of the Predicate, is called the
    '=Sign of Quantity=.' STOP (2) Name of Subject STOP (3) The verb "are" (or "is") STOP (This is called the
    '=Copula=.' STOP (4) Name of Predicate STOP pg010
Sec STOP 3 STOP _Various kinds of Propositions._

A Proposition, that begins with "Some", is said to be '=Particular=. STOP It
is also called 'a Proposition =in I=. STOP [Note, that it is called 'Particular,' because it refers to a
    _part_ only of the Subject. STOP A Proposition, that begins with "No", is said to be '=Universal
Negative=. STOP It is also called 'a Proposition =in E=. STOP A Proposition, that begins with "All", is said to be '=Universal
Affirmative=. STOP It is also called 'a Proposition =in A=. STOP [Note, that they are called 'Universal', because they refer to
    the _whole_ of the Subject. STOP A Proposition, whose Subject is an _Individual_, is to be regarded as
_Universal_ STOP [Let us take, as an example, the Proposition "John is not well" STOP This of course implies that there is an _Individual_, to whom
    the speaker refers when he mentions "John", and whom the
    listener _knows_ to be referred to STOP Hence the Class "men
    referred to by the speaker when he mentions 'John'" is a
    one-Member Class, and the Proposition is equivalent to "_All_
    the men, who are referred to by the speaker when he mentions
    'John', are not well." STOP Propositions are of two kinds, 'Propositions of Existence' and
'Propositions of Relation. STOP These shall be discussed separately STOP pg011

 STOP _PROPOSITIONS OF EXISTENCE._


A '=Proposition of Existence=', when in normal form, has, for its
_Subject_, the Class "existing Things" STOP Its Sign of Quantity is "Some" or "No" STOP [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_
    existing Things are Members of its Predicate, it does _not_ tell
    us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with _two_
    numbers, which are, in ascending order, "0" and "1 or more." STOP It is called "a Proposition of Existence" because its effect is to
assert the _Reality_ (i.e STOP the real _existence_), or else the
_Imaginariness_, of its Predicate STOP [Thus, the Proposition "Some existing Things are honest men"
    asserts that the Class "honest men" is _Real_ STOP This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any
    one of the following forms:--

        (1) "Honest men exist";
        (2) "Some honest men exist";
        (3) "The Class 'honest men' exists";
        (4) "There are honest men";
        (5) "There are some honest men" STOP Similarly, the Proposition "No existing Things are men fifty
    feet high" asserts that the Class "men 50 feet high" is
    _Imaginary_ STOP This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any
    one of the following forms:--

        (1) "Men 50 feet high do not exist";
        (2) "No men 50 feet high exist";
        (3) "The Class 'men 50 feet high' does not exist";
        (4) "There are not any men 50 feet high";
        (5) "There are no men 50 feet high." STOP pg012

 STOP _PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION._


Sec STOP 1 STOP _Introductory._

A =Proposition of Relation=, of the kind to be here discussed, has, for
its Terms, two Specieses of the same Genus, such that each of the two
Names conveys the idea of some Attribute _not_ conveyed by the other STOP [Thus, the Proposition "Some merchants are misers" is of the
    right kind, since "merchants" and "misers" are Specieses of the
    same Genus "men"; and since the Name "merchants" conveys the
    idea of the Attribute "mercantile", and the name "misers" the
    idea of the Attribute "miserly", each of which ideas is _not_
    conveyed by the other Name STOP But the Proposition "Some dogs are setters" is _not_ of the
    right kind, since, although it is true that "dogs" and "setters"
    are Specieses of the same Genus "animals", it is _not_ true that
    the Name "dogs" conveys the idea of any Attribute not conveyed
    by the Name "setters" STOP Such Propositions will be discussed in
    Part II. STOP The Genus, of which the two Terms are Specieses, is called the
'=Universe of Discourse=,' or (more briefly) the '=Univ.='

The Sign of Quantity is "Some" or "No" or "All" STOP [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_
    Members of its Subject are _also_ Members of its Predicate, it
    does not tell us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with
    _three_ numbers, which are, in ascending order, "0", "1 or
    more", "the total number of Members of the Subject". STOP It is called "a Proposition of Relation" because its effect is to assert
that a certain _relationship_ exists between its Terms STOP pg013
Sec STOP 2 STOP _Reduction of a Proposition of Relation to Normal form._

The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:--

(1) Ascertain what is the _Subject_ (i.e., ascertain what Class we are
_talking about_);

(2) If the verb, governed by the Subject, is _not_ the verb "are" (or
"is"), substitute for it a phrase beginning with "are" (or "is");

(3) Ascertain what is the _Predicate_ (i.e., ascertain what Class it is,
which is asserted to contain _some_, or _none_, or _all_, of the Members
of the Subject);

(4) If the Name of each Term is _completely expressed_ (i.e STOP if it
contains a Substantive), there is no need to determine the 'Univ STOP '; but,
if either Name is _incompletely expressed_, and contains _Attributes_
only, it is then necessary to determine a 'Univ STOP ', in order to insert
its Name as the Substantive STOP (5) Ascertain the _Sign of Quantity_;

(6) Arrange in the following order:--

    Sign of Quantity,
    Subject,
    Copula,
    Predicate STOP [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules STOP (1)

    "Some apples are not ripe. STOP (1) The Subject is "apples. STOP (2) The Verb is "are. STOP (3) The Predicate is "not-ripe   . STOP (As no Substantive is
    expressed, and we have not yet settled what the Univ STOP is to be,
    we are forced to leave a blank. STOP (4) Let Univ STOP be "fruit. STOP (5) The Sign of Quantity is "some. STOP (6) The Proposition now becomes

        "Some | apples | are | not-ripe fruit. STOP pg014
    (2)

    "None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent. STOP (1) The Subject is "my speculations. STOP (2) The Verb is "have brought," for which we substitute the
    phrase "are    that have brought" STOP (3) The Predicate is "   that have brought &c."

    (4) Let Univ STOP be "transactions. STOP (5) The Sign of Quantity is "none of. STOP (6) The Proposition now becomes

        "None of | my speculations | are | transactions
        that have brought me as much as 5 per cent. STOP (3)

    "None but the brave deserve the fair. STOP To begin with, we note that the phrase "none but the brave" is
    equivalent to "no _not_-brave. STOP (1) The Subject has for its _Attribute_ "not-brave. STOP But no
    _Substantive_ is supplied STOP So we express the Subject as
    "not-brave   . STOP (2) The Verb is "deserve," for which we substitute the phrase
    "are deserving of" STOP (3) The Predicate is "   deserving of the fair. STOP (4) Let Univ STOP be "persons. STOP (5) The Sign of Quantity is "no. STOP (6) The Proposition now becomes

        "No | not-brave persons | are | persons deserving
        of the fair. STOP (4)

    "A lame puppy would not say "thank you" if you offered to lend
    it a skipping-rope. STOP (1) The Subject is evidently "lame puppies," and all the rest of
    the sentence must somehow be packed into the Predicate STOP (2) The Verb is "would not say," &c., for which we may
    substitute the phrase "are not grateful for. STOP (3) The Predicate may be expressed as "   not grateful for
    the loan of a skipping-rope. STOP (4) Let Univ STOP be "puppies. STOP (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all. STOP (6) The Proposition now becomes

        "All | lame puppies | are | puppies not grateful
        for the loan of a skipping-rope. STOP pg015
    (5)

    "No one takes in the _Times_, unless he is well-educated. STOP (1) The Subject is evidently persons who are not well-educated
    ("no _one_" evidently means "no _person_") STOP (2) The Verb is "takes in," for which we may substitute the
    phrase "are persons taking in. STOP (3) The Predicate is "persons taking in the _Times_. STOP (4) Let Univ STOP be "persons. STOP (5) The Sign of Quantity is "no. STOP (6) The Proposition now becomes

        "No | persons who are not well-educated | are |
        persons taking in the _Times_. STOP (6)

    "My carriage will meet you at the station. STOP (1) The Subject is "my carriage. STOP This, being an 'Individual,'
    is equivalent to the Class "my carriages. STOP (Note that this Class
    contains only _one_ Member. STOP (2) The Verb is "will meet", for which we may substitute the
    phrase "are    that will meet. STOP (3) The Predicate is "   that will meet you at the station. STOP (4) Let Univ STOP be "things. STOP (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all. STOP (6) The Proposition now becomes

        "All | my carriages | are | things that will meet
         you at the station. STOP (7)

    "Happy is the man who does not know what 'toothache' means! STOP (1) The Subject is evidently "the man &c." (Note that in this
    sentence, the _Predicate_ comes first. STOP At first sight, the
    Subject seems to be an '_Individual_'; but on further
    consideration, we see that the article "the" does _not_ imply
    that there is only _one_ such man STOP Hence the phrase "the man
    who" is equivalent to "all men who" STOP (2) The Verb is "are. STOP (3) The Predicate is "happy   . STOP (4) Let Univ STOP be "men. STOP (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all. STOP (6) The Proposition now becomes

        "All | men who do not know what 'toothache'
        means | are | happy men. STOP pg016
    (8)

    "Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever it may
    be. STOP (1) The Subject is "farmers. STOP (2) The Verb is "grumble," for which we substitute the phrase
    "are    who grumble. STOP (3) The Predicate is "   who always grumble &c."

    (4) Let Univ STOP be "persons. STOP (5) The Sign of Quantity is "some. STOP (6) The Proposition now becomes

        "Some | farmers | are | persons who always
        grumble at the weather, whatever it may be. STOP (9)

    "No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars. STOP (1) The Subject is "lambs. STOP (2) The Verb is "are. STOP (3) The Predicate is "   accustomed &c."

    (4) Let Univ STOP be "animals. STOP (5) The Sign of Quantity is "no. STOP (6) The Proposition now becomes

        "No | lambs | are | animals accustomed to smoke
        cigars. STOP (10)

    "I ca'n't understand examples that are not arranged in regular
    order, like those I am used to. STOP (1) The Subject is "examples that," &c.

    (2) The Verb is "I ca'n't understand," which we must alter, so
    as to have "examples," instead of "I," as the nominative case STOP It may be expressed as "are not understood by me. STOP (3) The Predicate is "   not understood by me. STOP (4) Let Univ STOP be "examples. STOP (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all. STOP (6) The Proposition now becomes

        "All | examples that are not arranged in regular
        order like those I am used to | are | examples not
        understood by me." STOP pg017
Sec STOP 3 STOP _A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", is a Double
Proposition._

A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", asserts (as we already
know) that "_All_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate" STOP This evidently contains, as a _part_ of what it tells us, the smaller
Proposition "_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the
Predicate" STOP [Thus, the Proposition "_All_ bankers are rich men" evidently
    contains the smaller Proposition "_Some_ bankers are rich men". STOP The question now arises "What is the _rest_ of the information which
this Proposition gives us? STOP In order to answer this question, let us begin with the smaller
Proposition, "_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the
Predicate," and suppose that this is _all_ we have been told; and let us
proceed to inquire what _else_ we need to be told, in order to know that
"_All_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate" STOP [Thus, we may suppose that the Proposition "_Some_ bankers are
    rich men" is all the information we possess; and we may proceed
    to inquire what _other_ Proposition needs to be added to it, in
    order to make up the entire Proposition "_All_ bankers are rich
    men". STOP Let us also suppose that the 'Univ. STOP (i.e STOP the Genus, of which both the
Subject and the Predicate are Specieses) has been divided (by the
Process of _Dichotomy_) into two smaller Classes, viz STOP (1) the Predicate;

    (2) the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of
    the Predicate STOP [Thus, we may suppose that the Genus "men," (of which both
    "bankers" and "rich men" are Specieses) has been divided into
    the two smaller Classes, "rich men", "poor men". STOP pg018
Now we know that _every_ Member of the Subject is (as shown at p. 6) a
Member of the Univ STOP Hence _every_ Member of the Subject is either in
Class (1) or else in Class (2) STOP [Thus, we know that _every_ banker is a Member of the Genus
    "men" STOP Hence, _every_ banker is either in the Class "rich men",
    or else in the Class "poor men". STOP Also we have been told that, in the case we are discussing, _some_
Members of the Subject are in Class (1) STOP What _else_ do we need to be
told, in order to know that _all_ of them are there STOP Evidently we need
to be told that _none_ of them are in Class (2); i.e STOP that _none_ of
them are Members of the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to
that of the Predicate STOP [Thus, we may suppose we have been told that _some_ bankers are

    order to know that _all_ of them are there STOP Evidently we need to
    be told that _none_ of them are in the Class "_poor_ men". STOP Hence a Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", is a _Double_
Proposition, and is '=equivalent=' to (i.e STOP gives the same information
as) the _two_ Propositions

    (1) "_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the
    Predicate";

    (2) "_No_ Members of the Subject are Members of the
    Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of
    the Predicate" STOP [Thus, the Proposition "_All_ bankers are rich men" is a
    _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the _two_
    Propositions

Sec STOP 4 STOP _What is implied, in a Proposition of Relation, as to the Reality of its
Terms?_

Note that the rules, here laid down, are _arbitrary_, and only apply to
Part I of my "Symbolic Logic. STOP A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "Some", is henceforward to be
understood as asserting that there are _some existing Things_, which,
being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e STOP that _some existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once STOP Hence
it is to be understood as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is
_Real_ STOP [Thus, the Proposition "Some rich men are invalids" is to be
    understood as asserting that _some existing Things_ are "rich
    invalids" STOP Hence it implies that _each_ of the two Classes,
    "rich men" and "invalids", taken by itself, is _Real_. STOP A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "No", is henceforward to be
understood as asserting that there are _no existing Things_ which, being
Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e STOP that _no
existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once STOP But this implies
nothing as to the _Reality_ of either Term taken by itself STOP [Thus, the Proposition "No mermaids are milliners" is to be
    understood as asserting that _no existing Things_ are
    "mermaid-milliners" STOP But this implies nothing as to the
    _Reality_, or the _Unreality_, of either of the two Classes,
    "mermaids" and "milliners", taken by itself STOP In this case as it
    happens, the Subject is _Imaginary_, and the Predicate _Real_. STOP A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", contains (see Sec STOP 3) a
similar Proposition beginning with "Some" STOP Hence it is to be understood
as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is _Real_ STOP [Thus, the Proposition "All hyaenas are savage animals" contains
    the Proposition "Some hyaenas are savage animals" STOP Hence it
    implies that _each_ of the two Classes, "hyaenas" and "savage
    animals", taken by itself, is _Real_. STOP pg020
Sec STOP 5 STOP _Translation of a Proposition of Relation into one or more Propositions
of Existence._

We have seen that a Proposition of Relation, beginning with "Some,"
asserts that _some existing Things_, being Members of its Subject, are
_also_ Members of its Predicate STOP Hence, it asserts that some existing
Things are Members of _both_; i.e STOP it asserts that some existing Things
are Members of the Class of Things which have _all_ the Attributes of
the Subject and the Predicate STOP Hence, to translate it into a Proposition of Existence, we take
"existing Things" as the new _Subject_, and Things, which have _all_ the
Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate, as the new Predicate STOP Similarly for a Proposition of Relation beginning with "No" STOP A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", is (as shown in Sec STOP 3)
equivalent to _two_ Propositions, one beginning with "Some" and the
other with "No", each of which we now know how to translate STOP [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules STOP (1)

First, let us suppose that the above Diagram is an enclosure assigned to
a certain Class of Things, which we have selected as our 'Universe of
Discourse. STOP or, more briefly, as our 'Univ' STOP [For example, we might say "Let Univ STOP be 'books'"; and we might
    imagine the Diagram to be a large table, assigned to all
    "books." STOP [The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, _not_
    to refer to the above Diagram, but to draw a large one for
    himself, _without any letters_, and to have it by him while he
    reads, and keep his finger on that particular _part_ of it,
    about which he is reading. STOP pg023
Secondly, let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which
we may call "x," and have divided the large Class, to which we have
assigned the whole Diagram, into the two smaller Classes whose
Differentiae are "x" and "not-x" (which we may call "x'"), and that we
have assigned the _North_ Half of the Diagram to the one (which we may
call "the Class of x-Things," or "the x-Class"), and the _South_ Half to
the other (which we may call "the Class of x'-Things," or "the
x'-Class") STOP [For example, we might say "Let x mean 'old,' so that x' will
    mean 'new'," and we might suppose that we had divided books into
    the two Classes whose Differentiae are "old" and "new," and had
    assigned the _North_ Half of the table to "_old_ books" and the
    _South_ Half to "_new_ books." STOP Thirdly, let us suppose that we have selected another Adjunct, which we
may call "y", and have subdivided the x-Class into the two Classes whose
Differentiae are "y" and "y'", and that we have assigned the North-_West_
Cell to the one (which we may call "the xy-Class"), and the North-_East_
Cell to the other (which we may call "the xy'-Class") STOP [For example, we might say "Let y mean 'English,' so that y'
    will mean 'foreign'", and we might suppose that we had
    subdivided "old books" into the two Classes whose Differentiae
    are "English" and "foreign", and had assigned the North-_West_
    Cell to "old _English_ books", and the North-_East_ Cell to "old
    _foreign_ books." STOP Fourthly, let us suppose that we have subdivided the x'-Class in the
same manner, and have assigned the South-_West_ Cell to the x'y-Class,
and the South-_East_ Cell to the x'y'-Class STOP [For example, we might suppose that we had subdivided "new
    books" into the two Classes "new _English_ books" and "new
    _foreign_ books", and had assigned the South-_West_ Cell to the
    one, and the South-_East_ Cell to the other. STOP It is evident that, if we had begun by dividing for y and y', and had
then subdivided for x and x', we should have got the _same_ four
Classes STOP Hence we see that we have assigned the _West_ Half to the
y-Class, and the _East_ Half to the y'-Class STOP pg024
    [Thus, in the above Example, we should find that we had assigned
    the _West_ Half of the table to "_English_ books" and the _East_
    Half to "_foreign_ books. STOP .------------------- STOP |   old   |   old   |

    four different Classes of books, as here shown. STOP The Reader should carefully remember that, in such a phrase as "the
x-Things," the word "Things" means that particular _kind_ of Things, to
which the whole Diagram has been assigned STOP [Thus, if we say "Let Univ STOP be 'books'," we mean that we have
    assigned the whole Diagram to "books. STOP In that case, if we took
    "x" to mean "old", the phrase "the x-Things" would mean "the old
    books." STOP The Reader should not go on to the next Chapter until he is _quite

 STOP _REPRESENTATION OF PROPOSITIONS._


Sec STOP 1 STOP _Introductory._

Henceforwards, in stating such Propositions as "Some x-Things exist" or
"No x-Things are y-Things", I shall omit the word "Things", which the
Reader can supply for himself, and shall write them as "Some x exist" or
"No x are y" STOP [Note that the word "Things" is here used with a special
    meaning, as explained at p STOP 23. STOP A Proposition, containing only _one_ of the Letters used as Symbols for
Attributes, is said to be '=Uniliteral=' STOP [For example, "Some x exist", "No y' exist", &c.]

A Proposition, containing _two_ Letters, is said to be ='Biliteral'= STOP [For example, "Some xy' exist", "No x' are y", &c.]

A Proposition is said to be '=in terms of=' the Letters it contains,
whether with or without accents STOP [Thus, "Some xy' exist", "No x' are y", &c., are said to be _in
    terms of_ x and y. STOP pg028
Sec STOP 2 STOP _Representation of Propositions of Existence._

Let us take, first, the Proposition "Some x exist" STOP [Note that this Proposition is (as explained at p. 12)
    equivalent to "Some existing Things are x-Things." STOP This tells us that there is at least _one_ Thing in the North Half; that
is, that the North Half is _occupied_ STOP And this we can evidently
represent by placing a _Red_ Counter (here represented by a _dotted_
circle) on the partition which divides the North Half STOP .------- STOP |  (. STOP |

exist", "Some y exist", and "Some y' exist" STOP [The Reader should make out all these for himself STOP In the
    "books" example, these Propositions would be "Some new books
    exist", &c.]

Let us take, next, the Proposition "No x exist" STOP This tells us that there is _nothing_ in the North Half; that is, that
the North Half is _empty_; that is, that the North-West Cell and the
North-East Cell are both of them _empty_ STOP And this we can represent by
placing _two Grey_ Counters in the North Half, one in each Cell STOP .------- STOP |( )|( )|

    .------- STOP [The Reader may perhaps think that it would be enough to place a
    _Grey_ Counter on the partition in the North Half, and that,
    just as a _Red_ Counter, so placed, would mean "This Half is
    _occupied_", so a _Grey_ one would mean "This Half is _empty_" STOP This, however, would be a mistake STOP We have seen that a _Red_
    Counter, so placed, would mean "At least _one_ of these two
    Cells is occupied: possibly _both_ are. STOP Hence a _Grey_ one
    would merely mean "At least _one_ of these two Cells is empty:
    possibly _both_ are" STOP But what we have to represent is, that
    both Cells are _certainly_ empty: and this can only be done by
    placing a _Grey_ Counter in _each_ of them STOP In the "books" example, this Proposition would be "No old books
    exist". STOP pg029
Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions "No x' exist",
"No y exist", and "No y' exist" STOP [The Reader should make out all these for himself STOP In the
    "books" example, these three Propositions would be "No new books
    exist", &c.]

Let us take, next, the Proposition "Some xy exist" STOP This tells us that there is at least _one_ Thing in the North-West Cell;

    _two_ Propositions "No old _English_ books exist" and "No old
    _foreign_ books exist". STOP Sec STOP 3 STOP _Representation of Propositions of Relation._

Let us take, first, the Proposition "Some x are y" STOP This tells us that at least _one_ Thing, in the _North_ Half, is also in
the _West_ Half STOP Hence it must be in the space _common_ to them, that
is, in the _North-West Cell_ STOP Hence the North-West Cell is _occupied_ STOP And this we can represent by placing a _Red_ Counter in it STOP .------- STOP |( STOP )|   |

    "books" example, these three Propositions would be "Some English
    books are new", &c.]

said to be '=Converse=' to each other; and the Process, of changing one
into the other, is called '=Converting=', or '=Conversion=' STOP [For example, if we were told to convert the Proposition

 STOP _INTERPRETATION OF BILITERAL DIAGRAM WHEN MARKED WITH COUNTERS._

Propositions, the Counters represent STOP As the process is simply the reverse of that discussed in the previous

    _Predicate_. STOP pg038
Similarly we may interpret a _Red_ and a _Grey_ counter, when placed in
any one of the seven similar positions

    Red in North-East, Grey in North-West;
    Red in South-West, Grey in South-East;
    Red in South-East, Grey in South-West;
    Red in North-West, Grey in South-West;

    Red in North-East, Grey in South-East;
    Red in South-East, Grey in North-East STOP Once more the genial friend must be appealed to, and requested to
examine the Reader on Tables II and III, and to make him not only
_represent_ Propositions, but also _interpret_ Diagrams when marked with
Counters STOP The Questions and Answers should be like this:--

    Q STOP Represent "No x' are y'. STOP A. Grey Counter in S.E STOP Cell STOP Q STOP Interpret Red Counter on E. partition STOP A STOP "Some y' exist. STOP Q STOP Represent "All y' are x. STOP A STOP Red in N.E STOP Cell; Grey in S.E STOP Q STOP Interpret Grey Counter in S.W STOP Cell STOP A STOP "No x'y exist" = "No x' are y" = "No y are x'" STOP &c., &c.

At first the Examinee will need to have the Board and Counters before
him; but he will soon learn to dispense with these, and to answer with
his eyes shut or gazing into vacancy STOP [Work Examples Sec STOP =1=, 5-8 (p STOP 97). STOP pg039

First, let us suppose that the above _left_-hand Diagram is the
Biliteral Diagram that we have been using in Book III., and that we
change it into a _Triliteral_ Diagram by drawing an _Inner Square_, so
as to divide each of its 4 Cells into 2 portions, thus making 8 Cells
altogether STOP The _right_-hand Diagram shows the result STOP [The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, _not_
    to refer to the above Diagrams, but to make a large copy of the
    right-hand one for himself, _without any letters_, and to have
    it by him while he reads, and keep his finger on that particular
    _part_ of it, about which he is reading. STOP pg040
Secondly, let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which
we may call "m", and have subdivided the xy-Class into the two Classes
whose Differentiae are m and m', and that we have assigned the N.W STOP _Inner_ Cell to the one (which we may call "the Class of xym-Things", or
"the xym-Class"), and the N.W STOP _Outer_ Cell to the other (which we may
call "the Class of xym'-Things", or "the xym'-Class") STOP [Thus, in the "books" example, we might say "Let m mean 'bound',
    so that m' will mean 'unbound'", and we might suppose that we
    had subdivided the Class "old English books" into the two
    Classes, "old English bound books" and "old English unbound
    books", and had assigned the N.W STOP _Inner_ Cell to the one, and
    the N.W STOP _Outer_ Cell to the other. STOP Thirdly, let us suppose that we have subdivided the xy'-Class, the
x'y-Class, and the x'y'-Class in the same manner, and have, in each
case, assigned the _Inner_ Cell to the Class possessing the Attribute m,
and the _Outer_ Cell to the Class possessing the Attribute m' STOP [Thus, in the "books" example, we might suppose that we had
    subdivided the "new English books" into the two Classes, "new
    English bound books" and "new English unbound books", and had
    assigned the S.W STOP _Inner_ Cell to the one, and the S.W STOP _Outer_
    Cell to the other. STOP It is evident that we have now assigned the _Inner Square_ to the
m-Class, and the _Outer Border_ to the m'-Class STOP [Thus, in the "books" example, we have assigned the _Inner
    Square_ to "bound books" and the _Outer Border_ to "unbound
    books". STOP When the Reader has made himself familiar with this Diagram, he ought to
be able to find, in a moment, the Compartment assigned to a particular
_pair_ of Attributes, or the Cell assigned to a particular _trio_ of
Attributes STOP The following Rules will help him in doing this:--

    (1) Arrange the Attributes in the order x, y, m.
                                                                   pg041
    (2) Take the _first_ of them and find the Compartment
    assigned to it STOP (3) Then take the _second_, and find what _portion_ of that
    compartment is assigned to it STOP (4) Treat the _third_, if there is one, in the same way STOP [For example, suppose we have to find the Compartment assigned
    to ym STOP We say to ourselves "y has the _West_ Half; and m has the
    _Inner_ portion of that West Half. STOP Again, suppose we have to find the Cell assigned to x'ym' STOP We
    say to ourselves "x' has the _South_ Half; y has the _West_
    portion of that South Half, i.e STOP has the _South-West Quarter_;
    and m' has the _Outer_ portion of that South-West Quarter." STOP The Reader should now get his genial friend to question him on the Table
given on the next page, in the style of the following specimen-Dialogue STOP Q STOP Adjunct for South Half, Inner Portion STOP A. x'm STOP Q.

    explained at p. 12) "Some existing Things are xm-Things". STOP This tells us that there is at least _one_ Thing in the Inner portion of

 STOP _REPRESENTATION OF TWO PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION, ONE IN TERMS OF x AND
m, AND THE OTHER IN TERMS OF y AND m, ON THE SAME DIAGRAM._


The Reader had better now begin to draw little Diagrams for himself, and
to mark them with the Digits "I" and "O", instead of using the Board and
Counters: he may put a "I" to represent a _Red_ Counter (this may be
interpreted to mean "There is at least _one_ Thing here"), and a "O" to
represent a _Grey_ Counter (this may be interpreted to mean "There is
_nothing_ here") STOP The Pair of Propositions, that we shall have to represent, will always
be, one in terms of x and m, and the other in terms of y and m.

When we have to represent a Proposition beginning with "All", we break
it up into the _two_ Propositions to which it is equivalent STOP When we have to represent, on the same Diagram, Propositions, of which
some begin with "Some" and others with "No", we represent the _negative_
ones _first_ STOP This will sometimes save us from having to put a "I" "on a
fence" and afterwards having to shift it into a Cell STOP [Let us work a few examples STOP (1)

        "No x are m';
         No y' are m" STOP Let us first represent "No x are m'" STOP This gives us Diagram a STOP Then, representing "No y' are m" on the same Diagram, we get
    Diagram b.

        "Some m are x;

    should get Diagram a STOP And if we were then to take "No m are y", which tells us that
    the Inner N.W STOP Cell is _empty_, we should be obliged to take the
    "I" off the fence (as it no longer has the choice of _two_
    Cells), and to put it into the Inner N.E STOP Cell, as in Diagram c.

    This trouble may be saved by beginning with "No m are y", as in
    Diagram b STOP And _now_, when we take "Some m are x", there is no fence to sit
    on STOP The "I" has to go, at once, into the N.E STOP Cell, as in
    Diagram c.

 STOP _INTERPRETATION, IN TERMS OF x AND y, OF TRILITERAL DIAGRAM, WHEN MARKED
WITH COUNTERS OR DIGITS._


The problem before us is, given a marked Triliteral Diagram, to
ascertain _what_ Propositions of Relation, in terms of x and y, are
represented on it STOP The best plan, for a _beginner_, is to draw a _Biliteral_ Diagram
alongside of it, and to transfer, from the one to the other, all the
information he can STOP He can then read off, from the Biliteral Diagram,
the required Propositions STOP After a little practice, he will be able to
dispense with the Biliteral Diagram, and to read off the result from the
Triliteral Diagram itself STOP To _transfer_ the information, observe the following Rules:--

    (1) Examine the N.W STOP Quarter of the Triliteral Diagram STOP (2) If it contains a "I", in _either_ Cell, it is certainly
    _occupied_, and you may mark the N.W STOP Quarter of the
    Biliteral Diagram with a "I" STOP (3) If it contains _two_ "O"s, one in _each_ Cell, it is
    certainly _empty_, and you may mark the N.W STOP Quarter of the
    Biliteral Diagram with a "O" STOP pg054

SYLLOGISMS STOP  STOP _INTRODUCTORY_


When a Trio of Biliteral Propositions of Relation is such that

    (1) all their six Terms are Species of the same Genus,

    (2) every two of them contain between them a Pair of
    codivisional Classes,

    (3) the three Propositions are so related that, if the first
    two were true, the third would be true,

the Trio is called a '=Syllogism='; the Genus, of which each of the six
Terms is a Species, is called its ='Universe of Discourse=', or, more
briefly, its '=Univ.='; the first two Propositions are called its
'=Premisses=', and the third its '=Conclusion='; also the Pair of
codivisional Terms in the Premisses are called its '=Eliminands=', and
the other two its '=Retinends=' STOP The Conclusion of a Syllogism is said to be '=consequent=' from its
Premisses: hence it is usual to prefix to it the word "Therefore" (or
the Symbol ".'.") STOP pg057
    [Note that the 'Eliminands' are so called because they are
    _eliminated_, and do not appear in the Conclusion; and that the
    'Retinends' are so called because they are _retained_, and _do_
    appear in the Conclusion STOP Note also that the question, whether the Conclusion is or is not
    _consequent_ from the Premisses, is not affected by the _actual_
    truth or falsity of any of the Trio, but depends entirely on
    their _relationship to each other_ STOP As a specimen-Syllogism, let us take the Trio

        "No x-Things are m-Things;
         No y-Things are m'-Things STOP No x-Things are y-Things. STOP which we may write, as explained at p. 26, thus:--

        "No x are m;
         No y are m' STOP No x are y" STOP Here the first and second contain the Pair of codivisional
    Classes m and m'; the first and third contain the Pair x and x;
    and the second and third contain the Pair y and y STOP Also the three Propositions are (as we shall see hereafter) so
    related that, if the first two were true, the third would also
    be true STOP Hence the Trio is a _Syllogism_; the two Propositions, "No x are
    m" and "No y are m'", are its _Premisses_; the Proposition "No x
    are y" is its _Conclusion_; the Terms m and m' are its
    _Eliminands_; and the Terms x and y are its _Retinends_ STOP Hence we may write it thus:--

        "No x are m;
         No y are m' STOP .' STOP No x are y" STOP As a second specimen, let us take the Trio

        "All cats understand French;
         Some chickens are cats STOP Some chickens understand French" STOP These, put into normal form, are

        "All cats are creatures understanding French;
         Some chickens are cats STOP Some chickens are creatures understanding French" STOP Here all the six Terms are Species of the Genus "creatures. STOP Also the first and second Propositions contain the Pair of
    codivisional Classes "cats" and "cats"; the first and third
    contain the Pair "creatures understanding French" and "creatures
    understanding French"; and the second and third contain the Pair
    "chickens" and "chickens" STOP pg058
    Also the three Propositions are (as we shall see at p. 64) so
    related that, if the first two were true, the third would be
    true STOP (The first two are, as it happens, _not_ strictly true in
    _our_ planet STOP But there is nothing to hinder them from being
    true in some _other_ planet, say _Mars_ or _Jupiter_--in which
    case the third would _also_ be true in that planet, and its
    inhabitants would probably engage chickens as
    nursery-governesses STOP They would thus secure a singular
    _contingent_ privilege, unknown in England, namely, that they
    would be able, at any time when provisions ran short, to utilise
    the nursery-governess for the nursery-dinner! STOP Hence the Trio is a _Syllogism_; the Genus "creatures" is its
    'Univ STOP '; the two Propositions, "All cats understand French" and
    "Some chickens are cats", are its _Premisses_, the Proposition
    "Some chickens understand French" is its _Conclusion_; the Terms
    "cats" and "cats" are its _Eliminands_; and the Terms,
    "creatures understanding French" and "chickens", are its
    _Retinends_ STOP Hence we may write it thus:--

        "All cats understand French;
         Some chickens are cats;
         .' STOP Some chickens understand French". STOP pg059

 STOP _PROBLEMS IN SYLLOGISMS._


Sec STOP 1 STOP _Introductory._

When the Terms of a Proposition are represented by _words_, it is said
to be '=concrete='; when by _letters_, '=abstract=. STOP To translate a Proposition from concrete into abstract form, we fix on a
Univ., and regard each Term as a _Species_ of it, and we choose a letter
to represent its _Differentia_ STOP [For example, suppose we wish to translate "Some soldiers are
    brave" into abstract form STOP We may take "men" as Univ., and
    regard "soldiers" and "brave men" as _Species_ of the _Genus_
    "men"; and we may choose x to represent the peculiar Attribute
    (say "military") of "soldiers," and y to represent "brave. STOP Then
    the Proposition may be written "Some military men are brave
    men"; _i.e._ "Some x-men are y-men"; _i.e._ (omitting "men," as
    explained at p. 26) "Some x are y. STOP In practice, we should merely say "Let Univ STOP be "men",
    x = soldiers, y = brave", and at once translate "Some soldiers
    are brave" into "Some x are y." STOP The Problems we shall have to solve are of two kinds, viz STOP (1) "Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between
them a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as
Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from
them. STOP (2) "Given a Trio of Propositions of Relation, of which every two
contain a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as a
Syllogism: to ascertain whether the proposed Conclusion is consequent
from the proposed Premisses, and, if so, whether it is _complete_. STOP These Problems we will discuss separately STOP pg060
Sec STOP 2 STOP _Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a
pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as Premisses: to
ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them._

The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:--

(1) Determine the 'Universe of Discourse' STOP (2) Construct a Dictionary, making m and m (or m and m') represent the
pair of codivisional Classes, and x (or x') and y (or y') the other two STOP (3) Translate the proposed Premisses into abstract form STOP (4) Represent them, together, on a Triliteral Diagram STOP (5) Ascertain what Proposition, if any, in terms of x and y, is _also_
represented on it STOP (6) Translate this into concrete form STOP It is evident that, if the proposed Premisses were true, this other
Proposition would _also_ be true STOP Hence it is a _Conclusion_ consequent
from the proposed Premisses STOP [Let us work some examples STOP (1)

        "No son of mine is dishonest;
         People always treat an honest man with respect" STOP Taking "men" as Univ., we may write these as follows:--

        "No sons of mine are dishonest men;
         All honest men are men treated with respect" STOP We can now construct our Dictionary, viz STOP m = honest; x = sons
    of mine; y = treated with respect STOP (Note that the expression "x = sons of mine" is an abbreviated
    form of "x = the Differentia of 'sons of mine', when regarded as
    a Species of 'men'". STOP The next thing is to translate the proposed Premisses into
    abstract form, as follows:--

        "No x are m';
         All m are y" STOP pg061
    Next, by the process described at p. 50, we represent these on a
    Triliteral Diagram, thus:--

        .--------------- STOP |(O)    |    (O)|
        |   .---|--- STOP |

        |       |       |
        .--------------- STOP Next, by the process described at p. 53, we transfer to a
    Biliteral Diagram all the information we can STOP .------- STOP |   |(O)|
        |---|---|
        |   |   |
        .------- STOP The result we read as "No x are y'" or as "No y' are x,"
    whichever we prefer STOP So we refer to our Dictionary, to see which
    will look best; and we choose

        "No x are y'",

    which, translated into concrete form, is

        "No son of mine fails to be treated with respect" STOP (2)

        "All cats understand French;
         Some chickens are cats" STOP Taking "creatures" as Univ., we write these as follows:--

        "All cats are creatures understanding French;
         Some chickens are cats" STOP We can now construct our Dictionary, viz STOP m = cats;
    x = understanding French; y = chickens STOP The proposed Premisses, translated into abstract form, are

        "All m are x;
         Some y are m" STOP In order to represent these on a Triliteral Diagram, we break up
    the first into the two Propositions to which it is equivalent,
    and thus get the _three_ Propositions

        (1) "Some m are x;
        (2)  No m are x';
        (3)  Some y are m" STOP The Rule, given at p. 50, would make us take these in the order
    2, 1, 3 STOP This, however, would produce the result

        .----------------- STOP |        |        |
        |   .----|---- STOP |

        |   .----|---- STOP |
        |        |        |
        .----------------- STOP pg062
    So it would be better to take them in the order 2, 3, 1 STOP Nos STOP (2) and (3) give us the result here shown; and now we need not
    trouble about No STOP (1), as the Proposition "Some m are x" is

        "Some y are x",

    which, translated into concrete form, is

        "Some chickens understand French. STOP (3)

        "All diligent students are successful;
         All ignorant students are unsuccessful" STOP Let Univ STOP be "students"; m = successful; x = diligent;
    y = ignorant STOP These Premisses, in abstract form, are

        "All x are m;

Let us agree that "x_{1}" shall mean "Some existing Things have the
Attribute x", i.e STOP (more briefly) "Some x exist"; also that "xy_{1}"
shall mean "Some xy exist", and so on STOP Such a Proposition may be called
an '=Entity=. STOP [Note that, when there are _two_ letters in the expression, it
    does not in the least matter which stands _first_: "xy_{1}" and
    "yx_{1}" mean exactly the same. STOP Also that "x_{0}" shall mean "No existing Things have the Attribute x",
i.e STOP (more briefly) "No x exist"; also that "xy_{0}" shall mean "No xy
exist", and so on STOP Such a Proposition may be called a '=Nullity=' STOP Also that "+" shall mean "and" STOP [Thus "ab_{1} + cd_{0}" means "Some ab exist and no cd exist". STOP Also that ">" shall mean "would, if true, prove" STOP [Thus, "x_{0} > xy_{0}" means "The Proposition 'No x exist'
    would, if true, prove the Proposition 'No xy exist'". STOP When two Letters are both of them accented, or both _not_ accented, they
are said to have '=Like Signs=', or to be '=Like=': when one is
accented, and the other not, they are said to have '=Unlike Signs=', or
to be '=Unlike=' STOP pg071

 STOP _REPRESENTATION OF PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION._


Let us take, first, the Proposition "Some x are y" STOP This, we know, is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence "Some xy
exist" STOP (See p STOP 31. STOP Hence it may be represented by the expression
"xy_{1}" STOP The Converse Proposition "Some y are x" may of course be represented by
the _same_ expression, viz STOP "xy_{1}" STOP Similarly we may represent the three similar Pairs of Converse
Propositions, viz.--

    "Some x are y'"  = "Some y' are x",
    "Some x' are y"  = "Some y are x'",
    "Some x' are y'" = "Some y' are x'" STOP Let us take, next, the Proposition "No x are y" STOP This, we know, is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence "No xy
exist" STOP (See p STOP 33. STOP Hence it may be represented by the expression
"xy_{0}" STOP The Converse Proposition "No y are x" may of course be represented by
the _same_ expression, viz STOP "xy_{0}" STOP Similarly we may represent the three similar Pairs of Converse
Propositions, viz.--

    "No x are y'"  = "No y' are x",
    "No x' are y"  = "No y are x'",
    "No x' are y'" = "No y' are x'" STOP pg072
Let us take, next, the Proposition "All x are y" STOP Now it is evident that the Double Proposition of Existence "Some x exist
and no xy' exist" tells us that _some_ x-Things exist, but that _none_
of them have the Attribute y': that is, it tells us that _all_ of them
have the Attribute y: that is, it tells us that "All x are y" STOP Also it is evident that the expression "x_{1} + xy'_{0}" represents this
Double Proposition STOP Hence it also represents the Proposition "All x are y" STOP [The Reader will perhaps be puzzled by the statement that the
    Proposition "All x are y" is equivalent to the Double
    Proposition "Some x exist and no xy' exist," remembering that it
    was stated, at p. 33, to be equivalent to the Double Proposition
    "Some x are y and no x are y'" (i.e STOP "Some xy exist and no xy'
    exist") STOP The explanation is that the Proposition "Some xy exist"
    contains _superfluous information_ STOP "Some x exist" is enough for
    our purpose. STOP This expression may be written in a shorter form, viz STOP "x_{1}y'_{0}",
since _each_ Subscript takes effect back to the _beginning_ of the
expression STOP Similarly we may represent the seven similar Propositions "All x are
y'", "All x' are y", "All x' are y'", "All y are x", "All y are x'",
"All y' are x", and "All y' are x'" STOP [The Reader should make out all these for himself. STOP It will be convenient to remember that, in translating a Proposition,
beginning with "All", from abstract form into subscript form, or _vice
versa_, the Predicate _changes sign_ (that is, changes from positive to
negative, or else from negative to positive) STOP [Thus, the Proposition "All y are x'" becomes "y_{1}x_{0}",
    where the Predicate changes from x' to x STOP Again, the expression "x'_{1}y'_{0}" becomes "All x' are y",
    where the Predicate changes for y' to y. STOP pg073

 STOP _SYLLOGISMS._


Sec STOP 1 STOP _Representation of Syllogisms._


We already know how to represent each of the three Propositions of a
Syllogism in subscript form STOP When that is done, all we need, besides, is
to write the three expressions in a row, with "+" between the Premisses,
and ">" before the Conclusion STOP [Thus the Syllogism

        "No x are m';
         All m are y STOP .' STOP No x are y'. STOP may be represented thus:--

        xm'_{0} + m_{1}y'_{0} > xy'_{0}

    When a Proposition has to be translated from concrete form into
    subscript form, the Reader will find it convenient, just at
    first, to translate it into _abstract_ form, and _thence_ into
    subscript form STOP But, after a little practice, he will find it
    quite easy to go straight from concrete form to subscript form. STOP pg074
Sec STOP 2 STOP _Formulae for solving Problems in Syllogisms._

When once we have found, by Diagrams, the Conclusion to a given Pair of
Premisses, and have represented the Syllogism in subscript form, we have
a _Formula_, by which we can at once find, without having to use
Diagrams again, the Conclusion to any _other_ Pair of Premisses having
the _same_ subscript forms STOP [Thus, the expression

        xm_{0} + ym'_{0} > xy_{0}

    is a Formula, by which we can find the Conclusion to any Pair of
    Premisses whose subscript forms are

        xm_{0} + ym'_{0}

    For example, suppose we had the Pair of Propositions

        "No gluttons are healthy;
         No unhealthy men are strong" STOP proposed as Premisses STOP Taking "men" as our 'Universe', and
    making m = healthy; x = gluttons; y = strong; we might translate
    the Pair into abstract form, thus:--

        "No x are m;
         No m' are y" STOP These, in subscript form, would be

        xm_{0} + m'y_{0}

    which are identical with those in our _Formula_ STOP Hence we at
    once know the Conclusion to be

        xy_{0}

    that is, in abstract form,

        "No x are y";

    that is, in concrete form,

        "No gluttons are strong". STOP I shall now take three different forms of Pairs of Premisses, and work
out their Conclusions, once for all, by Diagrams; and thus obtain some
useful Formulae STOP I shall call them "Fig STOP I", "Fig STOP II", and "Fig STOP III" STOP pg075

and which contain Unlike Eliminands STOP The simplest case is

                       .--------------- STOP .------- STOP xm_{0} + ym'_{0}   |(O)    |       |  |(O)|   |

                       |(O)    |       |
                       .--------------- STOP In this case we see that the Conclusion is a Nullity, and that the
Retinends have kept their Signs STOP And we should find this Rule to hold good with _any_ Pair of Premisses
which fulfil the given conditions STOP [The Reader had better satisfy himself of this, by working out,
    on Diagrams, several varieties, such as

        m_{1}x_{0} + ym'_{0} (which > xy_{0})
        xm'_{0} + m_{1}y_{0} (which > xy_{0})
        x'm_{0} + ym'_{0} (which > x'y_{0})
        m'_{1}x'_{0} + m_{1}y'_{0} (which > x'y'_{0}). STOP If either Retinend is asserted in the _Premisses_ to exist, of course it
may be so asserted in the _Conclusion_ STOP Hence we get two _Variants_ of Fig STOP I, viz STOP (a) where _one_ Retinend is so asserted;

(b) where _both_ are so asserted STOP [The Reader had better work out, on Diagrams, examples of these
    two Variants, such as

        m_{1}x_{0} + y_{1}m'_{0} (which proves y_{1}x_{0})
        x_{1}m'_{0} + m_{1}y_{0} (which proves x_{1}y_{0})
        x'_{1}m_{0} + y_{1}m'_{0} (which proves x'_{1}y_{0} + y_{1}x'_{0}). STOP The Formula, to be remembered, is

    xm_{0} + ym'_{0} > xy_{0}

with the following two Rules:--

    (1) _Two Nullities, with Unlike Eliminands, yield a Nullity,
    in which both Retinends keep their Signs._
                                                                   pg076

Sec STOP 3 STOP _Fallacies._

Any argument which _deceives_ us, by seeming to prove what it does not
really prove, may be called a '=Fallacy=' (derived from the Latin verb
_fallo_ "I deceive"): but the particular kind, to be now discussed,
consists of a Pair of Propositions, which are proposed as the Premisses
of a Syllogism, but yield no Conclusion STOP When each of the proposed Premisses is a Proposition in _I_, or _E_, or
_A_, (the only kinds with which we are now concerned,) the Fallacy may
be detected by the 'Method of Diagrams,' by simply setting them out on a
Triliteral Diagram, and observing that they yield no information which
can be transferred to the Biliteral Diagram STOP But suppose we were working by the 'Method of _Subscripts_,' and had to
deal with a Pair of proposed Premisses, which happened to be a
'Fallacy,' how could we be certain that they would not yield any
Conclusion STOP Our best plan is, I think, to deal with _Fallacies_ in the same was as
we have already dealt with _Syllogisms_: that is, to take certain forms
of Pairs of Propositions, and to work them out, once for all, on the
Triliteral Diagram, and ascertain that they yield _no_ Conclusion; and
then to record them, for future use, as _Formulae for Fallacies_, just as
we have already recorded our three _Formulae for Syllogisms_ STOP pg082
Now, if we were to record the two Sets of Formulae in the _same_ shape,
viz STOP by the Method of Subscripts, there would be considerable risk of
confusing the two kinds STOP Hence, in order to keep them distinct, I
propose to record the Formulae for _Fallacies_ in _words_, and to call
them "Forms" instead of "Formulae. STOP Let us now proceed to find, by the Method of Diagrams, three "Forms of
Fallacies," which we will then put on record for future use STOP They are as
follows:--

    (1) Fallacy of Like Eliminands not asserted to exist STOP (2) Fallacy of Unlike Eliminands with an Entity-Premiss STOP (3) Fallacy of two Entity-Premisses STOP These shall be discussed separately, and it will be seen that each fails
to yield a Conclusion STOP (1) _Fallacy of Like Eliminands not asserted to exist._

It is evident that neither of the given Propositions can be an _Entity_,
since that kind asserts the _existence_ of both of its Terms (see p.
20) STOP Hence they must both be _Nullities_ STOP Hence the given Pair may be represented by (xm_{0} + ym_{0}), with or

proceed as follows:--

BOOK VII STOP SORITESES STOP  STOP _INTRODUCTORY._


When a Set of three or more Biliteral Propositions are such that all
their Terms are Species of the same Genus, and are also so related that
two of them, taken together, yield a Conclusion, which, taken with
another of them, yields another Conclusion, and so on, until all have
been taken, it is evident that, if the original Set were true, the last
Conclusion would _also_ be true STOP Such a Set, with the last Conclusion tacked on, is called a '=Sorites=';
the original Set of Propositions is called its '=Premisses='; each of
the intermediate Conclusions is called a '=Partial Conclusion=' of the
Sorites; the last Conclusion is called its '=Complete Conclusion=,' or,
more briefly, its '=Conclusion='; the Genus, of which all the Terms are
Species, is called its '=Universe of Discourse=', or, more briefly, its
'=Univ.='; the Terms, used as Eliminands in the Syllogisms, are called
its '=Eliminands='; and the two Terms, which are retained, and therefore
appear in the Conclusion, are called its '=Retinends=' STOP [Note that each _Partial_ Conclusion contains one or two
    _Eliminands_; but that the _Complete_ Conclusion contains
    _Retinends_ only. STOP The Conclusion is said to be '=consequent=' from the Premisses; for
which reason it is usual to prefix to it the word "Therefore" (or the
symbol ".'.") STOP [Note that the question, whether the Conclusion is or is not
    _consequent_ from the Premisses, is not affected by the _actual_
    truth or falsity of any one of the Propositions which make up
    the Sorites, by depends entirely on their _relationship to one
    another_ STOP pg086
    As a specimen-Sorites, let us take the following Set of 5
    Propositions:--

        (1) "No a are b';
        (2)  All b are c;
        (3)  All c are d;
        (4)  No e' are a';
        (5)  All h are e'" STOP Here the first and second, taken together, yield "No a are c'" STOP This, taken along with the third, yields "No a are d'" STOP This, taken along with the fourth, yields "No d' are e'" STOP And this, taken along with the fifth, yields "All h are d" STOP Hence, if the original Set were true, this would _also_ be true STOP Hence the original Set, with this tacked on, is a _Sorites_; the
    original Set is its _Premisses_; the Proposition "All h are d"
    is its _Conclusion_; the Terms a, b, c, e are its _Eliminands_;
    and the Terms d and h are its _Retinends_ STOP Hence we may write the whole Sorites thus:--

        "No a are b';
         All b are c;
         All c are d;
         No e' are a';
         All h are e' STOP .' STOP All h are d" STOP In the above Sorites, the 3 Partial Conclusions are the
    Positions "No a are e'", "No a are d'", "No d' are e'"; but, if
    the Premisses were arranged in other ways, other Partial
    Conclusions might be obtained STOP Thus, the order 41523 yields the
    Partial Conclusions "No c' are b'", "All h are b", "All h are
    c" STOP There are altogether _nine_ Partial Conclusions to this
    Sorites, which the Reader will find it an interesting task to
    make out for himself. STOP pg087

 STOP _PROBLEMS IN SORITESES._


Sec STOP 1 STOP _Introductory._

The Problems we shall have to solve are of the following form:--

"Given three or more Propositions of Relation, which are proposed as
Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from
them. STOP We will limit ourselves, at present, to Problems which can be worked by
the Formulae of Fig STOP I STOP (See p STOP 75. STOP Those, that require _other_ Formulae,
are rather too hard for beginners STOP Such Problems may be solved by either of two Methods, viz STOP (1) The Method of Separate Syllogisms;
    (2) The Method of Underscoring STOP These shall be discussed separately STOP pg088
Sec STOP 2 STOP _Solution by Method of Separate Syllogisms._

The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:--

    (1) Name the 'Universe of Discourse' STOP (2) Construct a Dictionary, making a, b, c, &c. represent
    the Terms STOP (3) Put the Proposed Premisses into subscript form STOP (4) Select two which, containing between them a pair of
    codivisional Classes, can be used as the Premisses of a
    Syllogism STOP (5) Find their Conclusion by Formula STOP (6) Find a third Premiss which, along with this Conclusion,
    can be used as the Premisses of a second Syllogism STOP (7) Find a second Conclusion by Formula STOP (8) Proceed thus, until all the proposed Premisses have
    been used STOP (9) Put the last Conclusion, which is the Complete
    Conclusion of the Sorites, into concrete form STOP [As an example of this process, let us take, as the proposed Set
    of Premisses,

        (1) "All the policemen on this beat sup with our cook;
        (2)  No man with long hair can fail to be a poet;
        (3)  Amos Judd has never been in prison;
        (4)  Our cook's 'cousins' all love cold mutton;
        (5)  None but policemen on this beat are poets;
        (6)  None but her 'cousins' ever sup with our cook;
        (7)  Men with short hair have all been in prison. STOP Univ STOP "men"; a = Amos Judd; b = cousins of our cook; c = having
    been in prison; d = long-haired; e = loving cold mutton;
    h = poets; k = policemen on this beat; l = supping with our cook
                                                                   pg089
    We now have to put the proposed Premisses into _subscript_ form STOP Let us begin by putting them into _abstract_ form STOP The result is

        (1) "All k are l;
        (2)  No d are h';
        (3)  All a are c';
        (4)  All b are e;
        (5)  No k' are h;
        (6)  No b' are l;
        (7)  All d' are c."

    And it is now easy to put them into _subscript_ form, as
    follows:--

        (1) k_{1}l'_{0}
        (2) dh'_{0}
        (3) a_{1}c_{0}
        (4) b_{1}e'_{0}
        (5) k'h_{0}
        (6) b'l_{0}
        (7) d'_{1}c'_{0}

    We now have to find a pair of Premisses which will yield a
    Conclusion STOP Let us begin with No STOP (1), and look down the list,
    till we come to one which we can take along with it, so as to
    form Premisses belonging to Fig STOP I STOP We find that No STOP (5) will
    do, since we can take k as our Eliminand STOP So our first syllogism
    is

        (1) k_{1}l'_{0}
        (5) k'h_{0}
            .' STOP l'h_{0} ... (8)

    We must now begin again with l'h_{0} and find a Premiss to go
    along with it STOP We find that No STOP (2) will do, h being our
    Eliminand STOP So our next Syllogism is

        (8) l'h_{0}
        (2) dh'_{0}
            .' STOP l'd_{0} ... (9)

    We have now used up Nos STOP (1), (5), and (2), and must search
    among the others for a partner for l'd_{0} STOP We find that No STOP (6)
    will do STOP So we write

        (9) l'd_{0}
        (6) b'l_{0}
            .' STOP db'_{0} ... (10)

    Now what can we take along with db'_{0} STOP No STOP (4) will do STOP (10) db'_{0}
        (4) b_{1}e'_{0}
            .' STOP de'_{0} ... (11)
                                                                   pg090
    Along with this we may take No STOP (7) STOP (11) de'_{0}
        (7) d'_{1}c'_{0}
            .' STOP c'e'_{0} ... (12)

    And along with this we may take No STOP (3) STOP (12) c'e'_{0}
        (3) a_{1}c_{0}
            .' STOP a_{1}e'_{0}

    This Complete Conclusion, translated into _abstract_ form, is

        "All a are e";

    and this, translated into _concrete_ form, is

        "Amos Judd loves cold mutton. STOP In actually _working_ this Problem, the above explanations
    would, of course, be omitted, and all, that would appear on
    paper, would be as follows:--

        (3) a_{1}c_{0}
        (4) b_{1}e'_{0}

Sec STOP 3 STOP _Solution by Method of Underscoring._

Consider the Pair of Premisses

    xm_{0} + ym'_{0}

which yield the Conclusion xy_{0}

We see that, in order to get this Conclusion, we must eliminate m and
m', and write x and y together in one expression STOP Now, if we agree to _mark_ m and m' as eliminated, and to read the two
expressions together, as if they were written in one, the two Premisses
will then exactly represent the _Conclusion_, and we need not write it
out separately STOP Let us agree to mark the eliminated letters by _underscoring_ them,
putting a _single_ score under the _first_, and a _double_ one under the
_second_ STOP The two Premisses now become

    xm_{0} + ym'_{0}
     -        =

which we read as "xy_{0}" STOP In copying out the Premisses for underscoring, it will be convenient to
_omit all subscripts_ STOP As to the "0's" we may always _suppose_ them
written, and, as to the "1's", we are not concerned to know _which_
Terms are asserted to _exist_, except those which appear in the
_Complete_ Conclusion; and for _them_ it will be easy enough to refer to
the original list STOP pg092
    [I will now go through the process of solving, by this method,
    the example worked in Sec STOP 2 STOP The Data are

             1           2          3             4
        k_{1}l'_{0} + dh'_{0} + a_{1}c_{0} + b_{1}e'_{0} +

           5         6           7
        k'h_{0} + b'l_{0} + d'_{1}c'_{0}

    The Reader should take a piece of paper, and write out this
    solution for himself STOP The first line will consist of the above
    Data; the second must be composed, bit by bit, according to the
    following directions STOP We begin by writing down the first Premiss, with its numeral
    over it, but omitting the subscripts STOP We have now to find a Premiss which can be combined with this,
    _i.e._, a Premiss containing either k' or l. The first we find
    is No STOP 5; and this we tack on, with a + STOP To get the _Conclusion_ from these, k and k' must be eliminated,
    and what remains must be taken as one expression STOP So we
    _underscore_ them, putting a _single_ score under k, and a
    _double_ one under k' STOP The result we read as l'h STOP We must now find a Premiss containing either l or h' STOP Looking
    along the row, we fix on No STOP 2, and tack it on STOP Now these 3 Nullities are really equivalent to (l'h + dh'), in
    which h and h' must be eliminated, and what remains taken as one
    expression STOP So we _underscore_ them STOP The result reads as l'd STOP We now want a Premiss containing l or d' STOP No STOP 6 will do STOP These 4 Nullities are really equivalent to (l'd + b'l) STOP So we
    underscore l' and l. The result reads as db' STOP We now want a Premiss containing d' or b STOP No STOP 4 will do STOP Here we underscore b' and b STOP The result reads as de' STOP We now want a Premiss containing d' or e. No STOP 7 will do STOP Here we underscore d and d' STOP The result reads as c'e' STOP We now want a Premiss containing c or e. No STOP 3 will do--in fact
    _must_ do, as it is the only one left STOP Here we underscore c' and c; and, as the whole thing now reads
    as e'a, we tack on e'a_{0} as the _Conclusion_, with a > STOP We now look along the row of Data, to see whether e' or a has
    been given as _existent_ STOP We find that a has been so given in
    No STOP 3 STOP So we add this fact to the Conclusion, which now stands
    as > e'a_{0} + a_{1}, _i.e._ > a_{1}e'_{0}; i.e STOP "All a are e."

    If the Reader has faithfully obeyed the above directions, his
    written solution will now stand as follows:--

             1           2          3             4
        k_{1}l'_{0} + dh'_{0} + a_{1}c_{0} + b_{1}e'_{0} +

           5         6           7

         1     5     2     6     4     7      3
        kl' + k'h + dh' + b'l + be' + d'c' + ac
        --    = -   -=    - =   =     = -     =

        > e'a_{0} + a_{1}


        _i.e._ > a_{1}e'_{0};

    _i.e._ "All a are e."
                                                                   pg093
    The Reader should now take a second piece of paper, and copy the
    Data only, and try to work out the solution for himself,
    beginning with some other Premiss STOP If he fails to bring out the Conclusion a_{1}e'_{0}, I would
    advise him to take a third piece of paper, and _begin again_! STOP I will now work out, in its briefest form, a Sorites of 5 Premisses, to
serve as a model for the Reader to imitate in working examples STOP (1) "I greatly value everything that John gives me;
    (2)  Nothing but this bone will satisfy my dog;
    (3)  I take particular care of everything that I greatly
         value;
    (4)  This bone was a present from John;
    (5)  The things, of which I take particular care, are
         things I do _not_ give to my dog" STOP Univ STOP "things"; a = given by John to me; b = given by me to my dog;

particular care of by me; h = this bone STOP 1           2           3             4            5

read" STOP The Proposition may be written

Attribute is "relating to excise" STOP The Proposition may be written

    "All | laws passed last week | are | laws relating to excise" STOP 13 STOP Univ STOP is "things" STOP The Subject is evidently the Class, of studies,

NOTES STOP (A) [See p. 80] STOP One of the favourite objections, brought against the Science of Logic by
its detractors, is that a Syllogism has no real validity as an argument,
since it involves the Fallacy of _Petitio Principii_ (i.e STOP "Begging the
Question", the essence of which is that the whole Conclusion is involved
in _one_ of the Premisses) STOP This formidable objection is refuted, with beautiful clearness and
simplicity, by these three Diagrams, which show us that, in each of the
three Figures, the Conclusion is really involved in the _two_ Premisses
taken together, each contributing its share STOP Thus, in Fig STOP I., the Premiss xm_{0} empties the _Inner_ Cell of the
N.W STOP Quarter, while the Premiss ym_{0} empties its _Outer_ Cell STOP Hence
it needs the _two_ Premisses to empty the _whole_ of the N.W STOP Quarter,
and thus to prove the Conclusion xy_{0} STOP Again, in Fig STOP II., the Premiss xm_{0} empties the Inner Cell of the
N.W STOP Quarter STOP The Premiss ym_{1} merely tells us that the Inner Portion
of the W. Half is _occupied_, so that we may place a 'I' in it,
_somewhere_; but, if this were the _whole_ of our information, we should
not know in _which_ Cell to place it, so that it would have to 'sit on
the fence': it is only when we learn, from the other Premiss, that the
_upper_ of these two Cells is _empty_, that we feel authorised to place
the 'I' in the _lower_ Cell, and thus to prove the Conclusion x'y_{1} STOP Lastly, in Fig STOP III., the information, that m _exists_, merely
authorises us to place a 'I' _somewhere_ in the Inner Square----but it
has large choice of fences to sit upon STOP It needs the Premiss xm_{0} to
drive it out of the N. Half of that Square; and it needs the Premiss
ym_{0} to drive it out of the W. Half STOP Hence it needs the _two_
Premisses to drive it into the Inner Portion of the S.E STOP Quarter, and
thus to prove the Conclusion x'y'_{1} STOP pg165


APPENDIX,

ADDRESSED TO TEACHERS STOP Sec STOP 1 STOP _Introductory._


There are several matters, too hard to discuss with _Learners_, which
nevertheless need to be explained to any _Teachers_, into whose hands
this book may fall, in order that they may thoroughly understand what my
Symbolic Method _is_, and in what respects it differs from the many
other Methods already published STOP These matters are as follows:--

    The "Existential Import" of Propositions STOP The use of "is-not" (or "are-not") as a Copula STOP The theory "two Negative Premisses prove nothing. STOP Euler's Method of Diagrams STOP Venn's Method of Diagrams STOP My Method of Diagrams STOP The Solution of a Syllogism by various Methods STOP My Method of treating Syllogisms and Sorites STOP Some account of Parts II, III STOP Sec STOP 2 STOP _The "Existential Import" of Propositions._


The writers, and editors, of the Logical text-books which run in the
ordinary grooves----to whom I shall hereafter refer by the (I hope
inoffensive) title "The Logicians"----take, on this subject, what seems
to me to be a more humble position than is at all necessary STOP They speak
of the Copula of a Proposition "with bated breath", almost as if it were
a living, conscious Entity, capable of declaring for itself what it
chose to mean, and that we, poor human creatures, had nothing to do but
to ascertain _what_ was its sovereign will and pleasure, and submit to
it STOP pg166
In opposition to this view, I maintain that any writer of a book is
fully authorised in attaching any meaning he likes to any word or phrase
he intends to use STOP If I find an author saying, at the beginning of his
book, "Let it be understood that by the word '_black_' I shall always
mean '_white_', and that by the word '_white_' I shall always mean
'_black_'," I meekly accept his ruling, however injudicious I may think
it STOP And so, with regard to the question whether a Proposition is or is not
to be understood as asserting the existence of its Subject, I maintain
that every writer may adopt his own rule, provided of course that it is
consistent with itself and with the accepted facts of Logic STOP Let us consider certain views that may _logically_ be held, and thus
settle which of them may _conveniently_ be held; after which I shall
hold myself free to declare which of them _I_ intend to hold STOP The _kinds_ of Propositions, to be considered, are those that begin with
"some", with "no", and with "all" STOP These are usually called Propositions
"in _I_", "in _E_", and "in _A_" STOP First, then, a Proposition in _I_ may be understood as asserting, or
else as _not_ asserting, the existence of its Subject STOP (By "existence" I
mean of course whatever kind of existence suits its nature STOP The two
Propositions, "_dreams_ exist" and "_drums_ exist", denote two totally
different kinds of "existence" STOP A _dream_ is an aggregate of ideas, and
exists only in the _mind of a dreamer_: whereas a _drum_ is an aggregate
of wood and parchment, and exists in _the hands of a drummer_. STOP First, let us suppose that _I_ "asserts" (i.e STOP "asserts the existence of
its Subject") STOP Here, of course, we must regard a Proposition in _A_ as making the
_same_ assertion, since it necessarily _contains_ a Proposition in _I_ STOP We now have _I_ and _A_ "asserting" STOP Does this leave us free to make
what supposition we choose as to _E_ STOP My answer is "No STOP We are tied down
to the supposition that _E_ does _not_ assert. STOP This can be proved as
follows:--

If possible, let _E_ "assert" STOP Then (taking x, y, and z to represent
Attributes) we see that, if the Proposition "No xy are z" be true, some
things exist with the Attributes x and y: i.e STOP "Some x are y. STOP pg167
Also we know that, if the Proposition "Some xy are z" be true, the same
result follows STOP But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of
them _must_ be true STOP Hence this result is _always_ true: i.e STOP the
Proposition "Some x are y" is _always_ true STOP _Quod est absurdum._ (See Note (A), p. 195) STOP We see, then, that the supposition "_I_ asserts" necessarily leads to
"_A_ asserts, but _E_ does not" STOP And this is the _first_ of the various
views that may conceivably be held STOP Next, let us suppose that _I_ does _not_ "assert. STOP And, along with this,
let us take the supposition that _E_ _does_ "assert. STOP Hence the Proposition "No x are y" means "Some x exist, and none of them
are y": i.e STOP "_all_ of them are _not_-y," which is a Proposition in _A_ STOP We also know, of course, that the Proposition "All x are not-y" proves
"No x are y. STOP Now two Propositions, each of which proves the other, are
_equivalent_ STOP Hence every Proposition in _A_ is equivalent to one in
_E_, and therefore "_asserts_" STOP Hence our _second_ conceivable view is "_E_ and _A_ assert, but _I_ does
not. STOP This view does not seen to involve any necessary contradiction with
itself or with the accepted facts of Logic STOP But, when we come to _test_
it, as applied to the actual _facts_ of life, we shall find I think,
that it fits in with them so badly that its adoption would be, to say
the least of it, singularly inconvenient for ordinary folk STOP Let me record a little dialogue I have just held with my friend Jones,
who is trying to form a new Club, to be regulated on strictly _Logical_
principles STOP _Author._ "Well, Jones STOP Have you got your new Club started yet? STOP _Jones_ (_rubbing his hands_) STOP "You'll be glad to hear that some of the
Members (mind, I only say '_some_') are millionaires STOP Rolling in gold,
my boy! STOP _Author._ "That sounds well STOP And how many Members have entered? STOP _Jones_ (_staring_) STOP "None at all STOP We haven't got it started yet STOP What
makes you think we have? STOP _Author._ "Why, I thought you said that some of the Members----"
                                                                   pg168
_Jones_ (_contemptuously_) STOP "You don't seem to be aware that we're
working on strictly _Logical_ principles STOP A _Particular_ Proposition
does _not_ assert the existence of its Subject STOP I merely meant to say
that we've made a Rule not to admit _any_ Members till we have at least
_three_ Candidates whose incomes are over ten thousand a year! STOP _Author._ "Oh, _that's_ what you meant, is it STOP Let's hear some more of
your Rules. STOP _Jones._ "Another is, that no one, who has been convicted seven times of
forgery, is admissible. STOP _Author._ "And here, again, I suppose you don't mean to assert there
_are_ any such convicts in existence? STOP _Jones._ "Why, that's exactly what I _do_ mean to assert STOP Don't you know
that a Universal Negative _asserts_ the existence of its Subject STOP _Of
course_ we didn't make that Rule till we had satisfied ourselves that
there are several such convicts now living. STOP The Reader can now decide for himself how far this _second_ conceivable
view would fit in with the facts of life STOP He will, I think, agree with
me that Jones' view, of the 'Existential Import' of Propositions, would
lead to some inconvenience STOP Thirdly, let us suppose that neither _I_ nor _E_ "asserts" STOP Now the supposition that the two Propositions, "Some x are y" and "No x
are not-y", do _not_ "assert", necessarily involves the supposition that
"All x are y" does _not_ "assert", since it would be absurd to suppose
that they assert, when combined, more than they do when taken
separately STOP Hence the _third_ (and last) of the conceivable views is that neither
_I_, nor _E_, nor _A_, "asserts" STOP The advocates of this third view would interpret the Proposition "Some x
are y" to mean "If there _were_ any x in existence, some of them _would_
be y"; and so with _E_ and _A_ STOP It admits of proof that this view, as regards _A_, conflicts with the
accepted facts of Logic STOP Let us take the Syllogism _Darapti_, which is universally accepted as
valid STOP Its form is

    "All m are x;
     All m are y STOP .' STOP Some y are x" STOP pg169
This they would interpret as follows:--

    "If there were any m in existence, all of them would be x;
     If there were any m in existence, all of them would be y STOP .' STOP If there were any y in existence, some of them
               would be x" STOP That this Conclusion does _not_ follow has been so briefly and clearly
explained by Mr. Keynes (in his "Formal Logic", dated 1894, pp STOP 356,
357), that I prefer to quote his words:--

"_Let no proposition imply the existence either of its subject or of its
predicate._

"Take, as an example, a syllogism in _Darapti_:--

    '_All M is P_,
     _All M is S_,
          _.' STOP Some S is P_. STOP "Taking S, M, P, as the minor, middle, and major terms respectively, the
conclusion will imply that, if there is an S, there is some P. Will the
premisses also imply this STOP If so, then the syllogism is valid; but not
otherwise STOP "The conclusion implies that if S exists P exists; but, consistently
with the premisses, S may be existent while M and P are both
non-existent STOP An implication is, therefore, contained in the conclusion,
which is not justified by the premisses. STOP This seems to _me_ entirely clear and convincing STOP Still, "to make
sicker", I may as well throw the above (_soi-disant_) Syllogism into a
concrete form, which will be within the grasp of even a _non_-logical
Reader STOP Let us suppose that a Boys' School has been set up, with the following
system of Rules:--

"All boys in the First (the highest) Class are to do French, Greek, and
Latin STOP All in the Second Class are to do Greek only STOP All in the Third
Class are to do Latin only. STOP Suppose also that there _are_ boys in the Third Class, and in the
Second; but that no boy has yet risen into the First STOP It is evident that there are no boys in the School doing French: still
we know, by the Rules, what would happen if there _were_ any STOP pg170
We are authorised, then, by the _Data_, to assert the following two
Propositions:--

    "If there were any boys doing French, all of them would
       be doing Greek;
     If there were any boys doing French, all of them would
       be doing Latin. STOP And the Conclusion, according to "The Logicians" would be

    "If there were any boys doing Latin, some of them would
       be doing Greek. STOP Here, then, we have two _true_ Premisses and a _false_ Conclusion (since
we know that there _are_ boys doing Latin, and that _none_ of them are
doing Greek) STOP Hence the argument is _invalid_ STOP Similarly it may be shown that this "non-existential" interpretation
destroys the validity of _Disamis_, _Datisi_, _Felapton_, and
_Fresison_ STOP Some of "The Logicians" will, no doubt, be ready to reply "But we are
not _Aldrichians_ STOP Why should _we_ be responsible for the validity of
the Syllogisms of so antiquated an author as Aldrich? STOP Very good STOP Then, for the _special_ benefit of these "friends" of mine
(with what ominous emphasis that name is sometimes used STOP "I must have a
private interview with _you_, my young _friend_," says the bland Dr.
Birch, "in my library, at 9 a.m. tomorrow STOP And you will please to be
_punctual_ STOP "), for their _special_ benefit, I say, I will produce
_another_ charge against this "non-existential" interpretation STOP It actually invalidates the ordinary Process of "Conversion", as applied
to Proposition in '_I_' STOP _Every_ logician, Aldrichian or otherwise, accepts it as an established
fact that "Some x are y" may be legitimately converted into "Some y are
x. STOP But is it equally clear that the Proposition "If there _were_ any x,
some of them _would_ be y" may be legitimately converted into "If there
_were_ any y, some of them would be x" STOP I trow not STOP The example I have already used----of a Boys' School with a non-existent
First Class----will serve admirably to illustrate this new flaw in the
theory of "The Logicians. STOP pg171
Let us suppose that there is yet _another_ Rule in this School, viz STOP "In
each Class, at the end of the Term, the head boy and the second boy
shall receive prizes. STOP This Rule entirely authorises us to assert (in the sense in which "The
Logicians" would use the words) "Some boys in the First Class will
receive prizes", for this simply means (according to them) "If there
_were_ any boys in the First Class, some of them _would_ receive
prizes. STOP Now the Converse of this Proposition is, of course, "Some boys, who will
receive prizes, are in the First Class", which means (according to "The
Logicians") "If there _were_ any boys about to receive prizes, some of
them _would_ be in the First Class" (which Class we know to be _empty_) STOP Of this Pair of Converse Propositions, the first is undoubtedly _true_:
the second, _as_ undoubtedly, _false_ STOP It is always sad to see a batsman knock down his own wicket: one pities
him, as a man and a brother, but, as a _cricketer_, one can but
pronounce him "Out! STOP We see, then, that, among all the conceivable views we have here
considered, there are only _two_ which can _logically_ be held, viz STOP _I_ and _A_ "assert", but _E_ does not STOP _E_ and _A_ "assert", but _I_ does not STOP The _second_ of these I have shown to involve great practical
inconvenience STOP The _first_ is the one adopted in this book STOP (See p STOP 19. STOP Some further remarks on this subject will be found in Note (B), at p.

again, "The Logicians" seem to me to take much too humble a position STOP When they are putting the final touches to the grouping of their
Proposition, just before the curtain goes up, and when the

too ready to answer, like the subtle cab-driver, "Leave it to _you_,
Sir! STOP The result seems to be, that the grasping Copula constantly gets a
"not" that had better have been merged in the Predicate, and that
Propositions are differentiated which had better have been recognised as
precisely similar STOP Surely it is simpler to treat "Some men are Jews" and
"Some men are Gentiles" as being both of them, _affirmative_
Propositions, instead of translating the latter into "Some men are-not
Jews", and regarding it as a _negative_ Propositions STOP The fact is, "The Logicians" have somehow acquired a perfectly _morbid_
dread of negative Attributes, which makes them shut their eyes, like
frightened children, when they come across such terrible Propositions as
"All not-x are y"; and thus they exclude from their system many very
useful forms of Syllogisms STOP Under the influence of this unreasoning terror, they plead that, in
Dichotomy by Contradiction, the _negative_ part is too large to deal
with, so that it is better to regard each Thing as either included in,
or excluded from, the _positive_ part STOP I see no force in this plea: and
the facts often go the other way STOP As a personal question, dear Reader,
if _you_ were to group your acquaintances into the two Classes, men that
you _would_ like to be seen with, and men that you would _not_ like to
be seen with, do you think the latter group would be so _very_ much the
larger of the two STOP For the purposes of Symbolic Logic, it is so _much_ the most convenient
plan to regard the two sub-divisions, produced by Dichotomy, on the
_same_ footing, and to say, of any Thing, either that it "is" in the
one, or that it "is" in the other, that I do not think any Reader of
this book is likely to demur to my adopting that course STOP pg173
Sec STOP 4 STOP _The theory that "two Negative Premisses prove nothing"._


This I consider to be _another_ craze of "The Logicians", fully as
morbid as their dread of a negative Attribute STOP It is, perhaps, best refuted by the method of _Instantia Contraria_ STOP Take the following Pairs of Premisses:--

    "None of my boys are conceited;
     None of my girls are greedy" STOP "None of my boys are clever;
     None but a clever boy could solve this problem" STOP "None of my boys are learned;
     Some of my boys are not choristers" STOP (This last Proposition is, in _my_ system, an _affirmative_ one, since I
should read it "are not-choristers"; but, in dealing with "The
Logicians," I may fairly treat it as a _negative_ one, since _they_
would read it "are-not choristers". STOP If you, dear Reader, declare, after full consideration of these Pairs of
Premisses, that you cannot deduce a Conclusion from _any_ of
them----why, all I can say is that, like the Duke in Patience, you "will
have to be contented with our heart-felt sympathy" STOP [See Note (C), p STOP 196. STOP Sec STOP 5 STOP _Euler's Method of Diagrams._


Diagrams seem to have been used, at first, to represent _Propositions_

class, and the Diagram consisted of two circles, which exhibited the

Thus, the Diagram, here given, exhibits the two Classes, whose
respective Attributes are x and y, as so related to each other that the
following Propositions are all simultaneously true:--"All x are y", "No
x are not-y", "Some x are y", "Some y are not-x", "Some not-y are

Similarly, with this Diagram, the following Propositions are true:--"All

"Some x are not-y", "Some not-x are y", "Some not-x are not-y", and of
course, their four Converses STOP Note that _all_ Euler's Diagrams assert "Some not-x are not-y. STOP Apparently it never occured to him that it might _sometimes_ fail to be
true STOP Now, to represent "All x are y", the _first_ of these Diagrams would
suffice STOP Similarly, to represent "No x are y", the _third_ would
suffice STOP But to represent any _Particular_ Proposition, at least _three_
Diagrams would be needed (in order to include all the possible cases),

Let us represent "not-x" by "x'" STOP Mr. Venn's Method of Diagrams is a great advance on the above Method STOP He uses the last of the above Diagrams to represent _any_ desired
relation between x and y, by simply shading a Compartment known to be
_empty_, and placing a + in one known to be _occupied_ STOP Thus, he would represent the three Propositions "Some x are y", "No x
are y", and "All x are y", as follows:--

        _____   _____
      _/     \_/     \_

It will be seen that, of the _four_ Classes, whose peculiar Sets of
Attributes are xy, xy', x'y, and x'y', only _three_ are here provided
with closed Compartments, while the _fourth_ is allowed the rest of the
Infinite Plane to range about in STOP This arrangement would involve us in very serious trouble, if we ever
attempted to represent "No x' are y'. STOP Mr. Venn _once_ (at p. 281)
encounters this awful task; but evades it, in a quite masterly fashion,
by the simple foot-note "We have not troubled to shade the outside of
this diagram" STOP To represent _two_ Propositions (containing a common Term) _together_, a
_three_-letter Diagram is needed STOP This is the one used by Mr. Venn STOP _____

Here, again, we have only _seven_ closed Compartments, to accommodate
the _eight_ Classes whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are xym, xym', &c.

"With four terms in request," Mr. Venn says, "the most simple and
symmetrical diagram seems to me that produced by making four ellipses
intersect one another in the desired manner" STOP This, however, provides
only _fifteen_ closed compartments STOP b  ____    ____  c

For _five_ letters, "the simplest diagram I can suggest," Mr. Venn says,
"is one like this (the small ellipse in the centre is to be regarded as

inside b and d but are no part of c) STOP It must be admitted that such a
diagram is not quite so simple to draw as one might wish it to be; but

This Diagram gives us 31 closed compartments STOP For _six_ letters, Mr. Venn suggests that we might use _two_ Diagrams,
like the above, one for the f-part, and the other for the not-f-part, of
all the other combinations STOP "This", he says, "would give the desired 64
subdivisions. STOP This, however, would only give 62 closed Compartments,

My Method of Diagrams _resembles_ Mr. Venn's, in having separate
Compartments assigned to the various Classes, and in marking these
Compartments as _occupied_ or as _empty_; but it _differs_ from his
Method, in assigning a _closed_ area to the _Universe of Discourse_, so
that the Class which, under Mr. Venn's liberal sway, has been ranging at
will through Infinite Space, is suddenly dismayed to find itself
"cabin'd, cribb'd, confined", in a limited Cell like any other Class STOP Also I use _rectilinear_, instead of _curvilinear_, Figures; and I mark
an _occupied_ Cell with a 'I' (meaning that there is at least _one_
Thing in it), and an _empty_ Cell with a 'O' (meaning that there is _no_
Thing in it) STOP For _two_ letters, I use this Diagram, in which the North Half is
assigned to 'x', the South to 'not-x' (or 'x''), the West to y, and the
East to y' STOP Thus the N.W STOP Cell contains the xy-Class, the N.E STOP Cell the
xy'-Class, and so on STOP .------- STOP |   |   |

_lattice_, which is a reduced copy of the whole Diagram; and, just as
the 16 large Cells of the whole Diagram are assigned to the 16 Classes
abcd, abcd', &c., so the 16 little Cells of each lattice are assigned to
the 16 Classes ehkl, ehkl', &c. Thus, the lattice in the N.W STOP corner
serves to accommodate the 16 Classes abc'd'ehkl, abc'd'eh'kl', &c. This

Finally, for _ten_ letters, I arrange 4 Octoliteral Diagrams, like the
above, in a square, assigning them to the 4 Classes mn, mn', m'n, m'n' STOP We have now got 1024 Cells STOP Sec STOP 8 STOP _Solution of a Syllogism by various Methods._


The best way, I think, to exhibit the differences between these various
Methods of solving Syllogisms, will be to take a concrete example, and
solve it by each Method in turn STOP Let us take, as our example, No STOP 29
(see p. 102) STOP "No philosophers are conceited;
     Some conceited persons are not gamblers STOP .' STOP Some persons, who are not gamblers, are not philosophers. STOP pg180
(1) _Solution by ordinary Method._

These Premisses, as they stand, will give no Conclusion, as they are
both negative STOP If by 'Permutation' or 'Obversion', we write the Minor Premiss thus,

    'Some conceited persons are not-gamblers,'

we can get a Conclusion in _Fresison_, viz STOP "No philosophers are conceited;
     Some conceited persons are not-gamblers STOP .' STOP Some not-gamblers are not philosophers"

This can be proved by reduction to _Ferio_, thus:--

    "No conceited persons are philosophers;
     Some not-gamblers are conceited STOP .' STOP Some not-gamblers are not philosophers" STOP The validity of _Ferio_ follows directly from the Axiom '_De Omni et
Nullo_' STOP (2) _Symbolic Representation._

Before proceeding to discuss other Methods of Solution, it is necessary
to translate our Syllogism into an _abstract_ form STOP Let us take "persons" as our 'Universe of Discourse'; and let
x = "philosophers", m = "conceited", and y = "gamblers. STOP Then the Syllogism may be written thus:--

    "No x are m;
     Some m are y' STOP .' STOP Some y' are x'. STOP (3) _Solution by Euler's Method of Diagrams._

From this group (Figs STOP 5 to 13) we have, by disregarding m, to find the
relation of x and y STOP On examination we find that Figs STOP 5, 10, 13 express
the relation of entire mutual exclusion; that Figs STOP 6, 11 express
partial inclusion and partial exclusion; that Fig STOP 7 expresses
coincidence; that Figs STOP 8, 12 express entire inclusion of x in y; and
that Fig STOP 9 expresses entire inclusion of y in x.

as occupied, by placing a 'I' in its only available Cell STOP .--------------- STOP |       |       |

Of all the strange things, that are to be met with in the ordinary
text-books of Formal Logic, perhaps the strangest is the violent
contrast one finds to exist between their ways of dealing with these two
subjects STOP While they have elaborately discussed no less than _nineteen_
different forms of _Syllogisms_----each with its own special and
exasperating Rules, while the whole constitute an almost useless
machine, for practical purposes, many of the Conclusions being
incomplete, and many quite legitimate forms being ignored----they have
limited _Sorites_ to _two_ forms only, of childish simplicity; and these
they have dignified with special _names_, apparently under the
impression that no other possible forms existed STOP As to _Syllogisms_, I find that their nineteen forms, with about a score
of others which they have ignored, can all be arranged under _three_
forms, each with a very simple Rule of its own; and the only question
the Reader has to settle, in working any one of the 101 Examples given
at p. 101 of this book, is "Does it belong to Fig STOP I., II., or III.? STOP pg184
As to _Sorites_, the only two forms, recognised by the text-books, are
the _Aristotelian_, whose Premisses are a series of Propositions in A,
so arranged that the Predicate of each is the Subject of the next, and
the _Goclenian_, whose Premisses are the very same series, written
backwards STOP Goclenius, it seems, was the first who noticed the startling
fact that it does not affect the force of a Syllogism to invert the
order of its Premisses, and who applied this discovery to a Sorites STOP If
we assume (as surely we may? STOP that he is the _same_ man as that
transcendent genius who first noticed that 4 times 5 is the same thing
as 5 times 4, we may apply to him what somebody (Edmund Yates, I think
it was) has said of Tupper, viz., "here is a man who, beyond all others
of his generation, has been favoured with Glimpses of the Obvious! STOP These puerile----not to say infantine----forms of a Sorites I have, in
this book, ignored from the very first, and have not only admitted
freely Propositions in _E_, but have purposely stated the Premisses in
random order, leaving to the Reader the useful task of arranging them,
for himself, in an order which can be worked as a series of regular

In Part II STOP will be found some of the matters mentioned in this
Appendix, viz., the "Existential Import" of Propositions, the use of a
_negative_ Copula, and the theory that "two negative Premisses prove
nothing. STOP I shall also extend the range of Syllogisms, by introducing
Propositions containing alternatives (such as "Not-all x are y"),
Propositions containing 3 or more Terms (such as "All ab are c", which,
taken along with "Some bc' are d", would prove "Some d are a'"), &c. I
shall also discuss Sorites containing Entities, and the _very_ puzzling
subjects of Hypotheticals and Dilemmas STOP I hope, in the course of Part
II., to go over all the ground usually traversed in the text-books used
in our Schools and Universities, and to enable my Readers to solve
Problems of the same kind as, and far harder than, those that are at
present set in their Examinations STOP In Part III STOP I hope to deal with many curious and out-of-the-way
subjects, some of which are not even alluded to in any of the treatises
I have met with STOP In this Part will be found such matters as the Analysis
of Propositions into their Elements (let the Reader, who has never gone
into this branch of the subject, try to make out for himself what
_additional_ Proposition would be needed to convert "Some a are b" into
"Some a are bc"), the treatment of Numerical and Geometrical Problems,
the construction of Problems, and the solution of Syllogisms and Sorites
containing Propositions more complex than any that I have used in Part
II STOP I will conclude with eight Problems, as a taste of what is coming in
Part II STOP I shall be very glad to receive, from any Reader, who thinks he
has solved any one of them (more especially if he has done so _without_
using any Method of Symbols), what he conceives to be its complete
Conclusion STOP It may be well to explain what I mean by the _complete_ Conclusion of a
Syllogism or a Sorites STOP I distinguish their Terms as being of two
kinds----those which _can_ be eliminated (e.g STOP the Middle Term of a
Syllogism), which I call the "Eliminands," and those which _cannot_,
which I call the "Retinends"; and I do not call the Conclusion
_complete_, unless it states _all_ the relations among the Retinends
only, which can be deduced from the Premisses STOP pg186

he takes mustard, then either Cole or Mill takes neither STOP (5) If Mill takes salt, then either Barry or Lang takes both condiments:
if he takes mustard, then either Cole or Dix takes only _one_ STOP The Problem is to discover whether these rules are _compatible_; and, if
so, what arrangements are possible STOP [N.B STOP In this Problem, it is assumed that the phrase "if Barry
    takes salt" allows of _two_ possible cases, viz STOP (1) "he takes
    salt _only_"; (2) "he takes _both_ condiments" STOP And so with all
    similar phrases STOP It is also assumed that the phrase "either Cole or Lang takes
    _one_ only of the two condiments" allows _three_ possible cases,
    viz STOP (1) "Cole takes _one_ only, Lang takes both or neither";
    (2) "Cole takes both or neither, Lang takes _one_ only"; (3)
    "Cole takes _one_ only, Lang takes _one_ only" STOP And so with all

NOTES TO APPENDIX STOP (A) [See p. 167, line 6. STOP It may, perhaps, occur to the Reader, who has studied Formal Logic that
the argument, here applied to the Propositions I and E, will apply
equally well to the Propositions I and A (since, in the ordinary
text-books, the Propositions "All xy are z" and "Some xy are not z" are
regarded as Contradictories) STOP Hence it may appear to him that the
argument might have been put as follows:--

"We now have I and A 'asserting. STOP Hence, if the Proposition 'All xy are
z' be true, some things exist with the Attributes x and y: i.e STOP 'Some x
are y. STOP "Also we know that, if the Proposition 'Some xy are not-z' be true the
same result follows STOP "But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of
them _must_ be true STOP Hence this result is always true: i.e STOP the
Proposition 'Some x are y' is _always_ true STOP "_Quod est absurdum._ Hence I _cannot_ assert. STOP This matter will be discussed in Part II; but I may as well give here
what seems to me to be an irresistable proof that this view (that _A_
and _I_ are Contradictories), though adopted in the ordinary text-books,
is untenable STOP The proof is as follows:--

With regard to the relationship existing between the Class 'xy' and the
two Classes 'z' and 'not-z', there are _four_ conceivable states of
things, viz STOP (1) Some xy are z, and some are not-z;
    (2)    "      "        none     "
    (3) No xy     "        some     "
    (4)    "      "        none     "

Of these four, No STOP (2) is equivalent to "All xy are z", No STOP (3) is
equivalent to "All xy are not-z", and No STOP (4) is equivalent to "No xy
exist. STOP Now it is quite undeniable that, of these _four_ states of things, each
is, _a priori_, _possible_, some _one must_ be true, and the other three
_must_ be false STOP Hence the Contradictory to (2) is "Either (1) or (3) or (4) is true. STOP Now the assertion "Either (1) or (3) is true" is equivalent to "Some xy
are not-z"; and the assertion "(4) is true" is equivalent to "No xy
exist. STOP Hence the Contradictory to "All xy are z" may be expressed as
the Alternative Proposition "Either some xy are not-z, or no xy exist,"
but _not_ as the Categorical Proposition "Some y are not-z. STOP pg196
(B) [See p. 171, at end of Section 2. STOP There are yet _other_ views current among "The Logicians", as to the
"Existential Import" of Propositions, which have not been mentioned in
this Section STOP One is, that the Proposition "some x are y" is to be interpreted,
neither as "Some x _exist_ and are y", nor yet as "If there _were_ any x
in existence, some of them _would_ be y", but merely as "Some x _can be_
y; i.e STOP the Attributes x and y are _compatible_" STOP On _this_ theory,
there would be nothing offensive in my telling my friend Jones "Some of
your brothers are swindlers"; since, if he indignantly retorted "What do
you _mean_ by such insulting language, you scoundrel STOP ", I should calmly
reply "I merely mean that the thing is _conceivable_----that some of
your brothers _might possibly_ be swindlers" STOP But it may well be doubted
whether such an explanation would _entirely_ appease the wrath of Jones STOP Another view is, that the Proposition "All x are y" _sometimes_ implies
the actual _existence_ of x, and _sometimes_ does _not_ imply it; and
that we cannot tell, without having it in _concrete_ form, _which_
interpretation we are to give to it STOP _This_ view is, I think, strongly
supported by common usage; and it will be fully discussed in Part II:
but the difficulties, which it introduces, seem to me too formidable to
be even alluded to in Part I, which I am trying to make, as far as
possible, easily intelligible to mere _beginners_ STOP (C) [See p. 173, Sec STOP 4. STOP The three Conclusions are

    "No conceited child of mine is greedy";
    "None of my boys could solve this problem";
    "Some unlearned boys are not choristers. STOP pg197

THE GAME OF LOGIC

By Lewis Carrol



  To my Child-friend STOP I charm in vain; for never again,
  All keenly as my glance I bend,
    Will Memory, goddess coy,
    Embody for my joy
  Departed days, nor let me gaze
    On thee, my fairy friend STOP Yet could thy face, in mystic grace,
  A moment smile on me, 'twould send
    Far-darting rays of light
    From Heaven athwart the night,
  By which to read in very deed
    Thy spirit, sweetest friend STOP So may the stream of Life's long dream
  Flow gently onward to its end,
    With many a floweret gay,
    Adown its willowy way:
  May no sigh vex, no care perplex,
    My loving little friend STOP NOTA BENE STOP With each copy of this Book is given an Envelope, containing a
Diagram (similar to the frontispiece) on card, and nine Counters,
four red and five grey STOP The Envelope, &c. can be had separately, at 3d STOP each STOP The Author will be very grateful for suggestions, especially from
beginners in Logic, of any alterations, or further explanations,
that may seem desirable STOP Letters should be addressed to him at
"29, Bedford Street, Covent Garden, London. STOP PREFACE



"There foam'd rebellious Logic, gagg'd and bound. STOP This Game requires nine Counters--four of one colour and five of
another:  say four red and five grey STOP Besides the nine Counters, it also requires one Player, AT LEAST STOP I am not aware of any Game that can be played with LESS than this
number:  while there are several that require MORE:  take Cricket,
for instance, which requires twenty-two STOP How much easier it is,
when you want to play a Game, to find ONE Player than twenty-two STOP At the same time, though one Player is enough, a good deal more
amusement may be got by two working at it together, and correcting
each other's mistakes STOP A second advantage, possessed by this Game, is that, besides being

 STOP NEW LAMPS FOR OLD STOP "Light come, light go. STOP _________

                1 STOP Propositions STOP "Some new Cakes are nice. STOP "No new Cakes are nice. STOP "All new cakes are nice. STOP There are three 'PROPOSITIONS' for you--the only three kinds we
are going to use in this Game:  and the first thing to be done is
to learn how to express them on the Board STOP Let us begin with

"Some new Cakes are nice. STOP But before doing so, a remark has to be made--one that is rather
important, and by no means easy to understand all in a moment:  so
please to read this VERY carefully STOP The world contains many THINGS (such as "Buns", "Babies", "Beetles" STOP "Battledores" STOP &c.);  and these Things possess many ATTRIBUTES
(such as "baked", "beautiful", "black", "broken", &c.:  in fact,
whatever can be "attributed to", that is "said to belong to", any
Thing, is an Attribute) STOP Whenever we wish to mention a Thing, we
use a SUBSTANTIVE:  when we wish to mention an Attribute, we use
an ADJECTIVE STOP People have asked the question "Can a Thing exist
without any Attributes belonging to it? STOP It is a very puzzling
question, and I'm not going to try to answer it:  let us turn up
our noses, and treat it with contemptuous silence, as if it really
wasn't worth noticing STOP But, if they put it the other way, and ask
"Can an Attribute exist without any Thing for it to belong to STOP ", we
may say at once "No:  no more than a Baby could go a railway-journey
with no one to take care of it! STOP You never saw "beautiful" floating
about in the air, or littered about on the floor, without any Thing
to BE beautiful, now did you STOP And now what am I driving at, in all this long rigmarole STOP It is
this STOP You may put "is" or "are" between names of two THINGS (for
example, "some Pigs are fat Animals"), or between the names of two
ATTRIBUTES (for example, "pink is light-red"), and in each case it
will make good sense STOP But, if you put "is" or "are" between the
name of a THING and the name of an ATTRIBUTE (for example, "some
Pigs are pink"), you do NOT make good sense (for how can a Thing
BE an Attribute? STOP unless you have an understanding with the person
to whom you are speaking STOP And the simplest understanding would, I
think, be this--that the Substantive shall be supposed to be repeated
at the end of the sentence, so that the sentence, if written out
in full, would be "some Pigs are pink (Pigs)" STOP And now the word
"are" makes quite good sense STOP Thus, in order to make good sense of the Proposition "some new Cakes
are nice", we must suppose it to be written out in full, in the
form "some new Cakes are nice (Cakes)" STOP Now this contains two
'TERMS'--"new Cakes" being one of them, and "nice (Cakes)" the
other STOP "New Cakes," being the one we are talking about, is called
the 'SUBJECT' of the Proposition, and "nice (Cakes)" the 'PREDICATE' STOP Also this Proposition is said to be a 'PARTICULAR' one, since it
does not speak of the WHOLE of its Subject, but only of a PART of
it STOP The other two kinds are said to be 'UNIVERSAL', because they
speak of the WHOLE of their Subjects--the one denying niceness, and
the other asserting it, of the WHOLE class of "new Cakes" STOP Lastly,
if you would like to have a definition of the word 'PROPOSITION'
itself, you may take this:--"a sentence stating that some, or
none, or all, of the Things belonging to a certain class, called
its 'Subject', are also Things belonging to a certain other class,
called its 'Predicate'" STOP You will find these seven words--PROPOSITION, ATTRIBUTE, TERM,
SUBJECT, PREDICATE, PARTICULAR, UNIVERSAL--charmingly useful, if
any friend should happen to ask if you have ever studied Logic STOP Mind you bring all seven words into your answer, and you friend
will go away deeply impressed--'a sadder and a wiser man' STOP Now please to look at the smaller Diagram on the Board, and suppose
it to be a cupboard, intended for all the Cakes in the world (it
would have to be a good large one, of course) STOP And let us suppose
all the new ones to be put into the upper half (marked 'x'), and all
the rest (that is, the NOT-new ones) into the lower half (marked
'x'') STOP Thus the lower half would contain ELDERLY Cakes, AGED
Cakes, ANTE-DILUVIAN Cakes--if there are any:  I haven't seen many,
myself--and so on STOP Let us also suppose all the nice Cakes to be
put into the left-hand half (marked 'y'), and all the rest (that
is, the not-nice ones) into the right-hand half (marked 'y'') STOP At
present, then, we must understand x to mean "new", x' "not-new",
y "nice", and y' "not-nice. STOP And now what kind of Cakes would you expect to find in compartment
No STOP 5 STOP It is part of the upper half, you see; so that, if it has any Cakes
in it, they must be NEW: and it is part of the left-hand half;
so that they must be NICE STOP Hence if there are any Cakes in this
compartment, they must have the double 'ATTRIBUTE' "new and nice":
or, if we use letters, the must be "x y. STOP Observe that the letters x, y are written on two of the edges of
this compartment STOP This you will find a very convenient rule for
knowing what Attributes belong to the Things in any compartment STOP Take No STOP 7, for instance STOP If there are any Cakes there, they must
be "x' y", that is, they must be "not-new and nice. STOP Now let us make another agreement--that a red counter in a
compartment shall mean that it is 'OCCUPIED', that is, that there
are SOME Cakes in it STOP (The word 'some,' in Logic, means 'one or
more' so that a single Cake in a compartment would be quite enough
reason for saying "there are SOME Cakes here") STOP Also let us agree
that a grey counter in a compartment shall mean that it is 'EMPTY',
that is that there are NO Cakes in it STOP In the following Diagrams,
I shall put '1' (meaning 'one or more') where you are to put a RED
counter, and '0' (meaning 'none') where you are to put a GREY one STOP As the Subject of our Proposition is to be "new Cakes", we are only
concerned, at present, with the UPPER half of the cupboard, where
all the Cakes have the attribute x, that is, "new. STOP Now, fixing our attention on this upper half, suppose we found it
marked like this,


                      -----------
                     |     |     |

                     |     |     |
                      -----------


that is, with a red counter in No STOP 5 STOP What would this tell us,
with regard to the class of "new Cakes" STOP Would it not tell us that there are SOME of them in the x y-compartment STOP That is, that some of them (besides having the Attribute x, which
belongs to both compartments) have the Attribute y (that is, "nice") STOP This we might express by saying "some x-Cakes are y-(Cakes)", or,
putting words instead of letters,


"Some new Cakes are nice (Cakes)",


or, in a shorter form,


"Some new Cakes are nice" STOP At last we have found out how to represent the first Proposition
of this Section STOP If you have not CLEARLY understood all I have
said, go no further, but read it over and over again, till you DO
understand it STOP After that is once mastered, you will find all the
rest quite easy STOP It will save a little trouble, in doing the other Propositions,
if we agree to leave out the word "Cakes" altogether STOP I find it
convenient to call the whole class of Things, for which the cupboard
is intended, the 'UNIVERSE. STOP Thus we might have begun this business
by saying "Let us take a Universe of Cakes. STOP (Sounds nice, doesn't
it? STOP Of course any other Things would have done just as well as Cakes STOP We might make Propositions about "a Universe of Lizards", or even
"a Universe of Hornets" STOP (Wouldn't THAT be a charming Universe to
live in? STOP So far, then, we have learned that


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  1  |     |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


means "some x and y," i.e STOP "some new are nice. STOP I think you will see without further explanation, that


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |     |  1  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


means "some x are y'," i.e STOP "some new are not-nice. STOP Now let us put a GREY counter into No STOP 5, and ask ourselves the
meaning of


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  0  |     |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


This tells us that the x y-compartment is EMPTY, which we may express
by "no x are y", or, "no new Cakes are nice" STOP This is the second
of the three Propositions at the head of this Section STOP In the same way,


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |     |  0  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


would mean "no x are y'," or, "no new Cakes are not-nice. STOP What would you make of this, I wonder STOP -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  1  |  1  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


I hope you will not have much trouble in making out that this
represents a DOUBLE Proposition: namely, "some x are y, AND some
are y'," i.e STOP "some new are nice, and some are not-nice. STOP The following is a little harder, perhaps:


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  0  |  0  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


This means "no x are y, AND none are y'," i.e STOP "no new are nice,
AND none are not-nice": which leads to the rather curious result
that "no new exist," i.e STOP "no Cakes are new. STOP This is because
"nice" and "not-nice" make what we call an 'EXHAUSTIVE' division
of the class "new Cakes": i.e STOP between them, they EXHAUST the whole
class, so that all the new Cakes, that exist, must be found in one
or the other of them STOP And now suppose you had to represent, with counters the contradictory
to "no Cakes are new", which would be "some Cakes are new", or,
putting letters for words, "some Cakes are x", how would you do
it STOP This will puzzle you a little, I expect STOP Evidently you must put
a red counter SOMEWHERE in the x-half of the cupboard, since you
know there are SOME new Cakes STOP But you must not put it into the
LEFT-HAND compartment, since you do not know them to be NICE: nor
may you put it into the RIGHT-HAND one, since you do not know them
to be NOT-NICE STOP What, then, are you to do STOP I think the best way out of the
difficulty is to place the red counter ON THE DIVISION-LINE between
the xy-compartment and the xy'-compartment STOP This I shall represent
(as I always put '1' where you are to put a red counter) by the
diagram


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |    -1-    |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


Our ingenious American cousins have invented a phrase to express
the position of a man who wants to join one or the other of two
parties--such as their two parties 'Democrats' and 'Republicans'--but
can't make up his mind WHICH STOP Such a man is said to be "sitting
on the fence. STOP Now that is exactly the position of the red counter
you have just placed on the division-line STOP He likes the look of
No STOP 5, and he likes the look of No STOP 6, and he doesn't know WHICH to
jump down into STOP So there he sits astride, silly fellow, dangling
his legs, one on each side of the fence STOP Now I am going to give you a much harder one to make out STOP What
does this mean STOP -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  1  |  0  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


This is clearly a DOUBLE Proposition STOP It tells us not only that
"some x are y," but also the "no x are NOT y. STOP Hence the result
is "ALL x are y," i.e STOP "all new Cakes are nice", which is the last
of the three Propositions at the head of this Section STOP We see, then, that the Universal Proposition


"All new Cakes are nice"


consists of TWO Propositions taken together, namely,


             "Some new Cakes are nice,"
        and "No new Cakes are not-nice. STOP In the same way


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  0  |  1  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


would mean "all x are y' ", that is,


"All new Cakes are not-nice. STOP Now what would you make of such a Proposition as "The Cake you have
given me is nice" STOP Is it Particular or Universal STOP "Particular, of course," you readily reply STOP "One single Cake is
hardly worth calling 'some,' even. STOP No, my dear impulsive Reader, it is 'Universal' STOP Remember that,
few as they are (and I grant you they couldn't well be fewer),
they are (or rather 'it is') ALL that you have given me STOP Thus, if
(leaving 'red' out of the question) I divide my Universe of Cakes
into two classes--the Cakes you have given me (to which I assign
the upper half of the cupboard), and those you HAVEN'T given me
(which are to go below)--I find the lower half fairly full, and the
upper one as nearly as possible empty STOP And then, when I am told
to put an upright division into each half, keeping the NICE Cakes
to the left, and the NOT-NICE ones to the right, I begin by carefully
collecting ALL the Cakes you have given me (saying to myself, from
time to time, "Generous creature STOP How shall I ever repay such
kindness STOP "), and piling them up in the left-hand compartment STOP AND
IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG TO DO IT STOP Here is another Universal Proposition for you STOP "Barzillai Beckalegg
is an honest man. STOP That means "ALL the Barzillai Beckaleggs, that
I am now considering, are honest men. STOP (You think I invented that
name, now don't you STOP But I didn't STOP It's on a carrier's cart,
somewhere down in Cornwall. STOP This kind of Universal Proposition (where the Subject is a single
Thing) is called an 'INDIVIDUAL' Proposition STOP Now let us take "NICE Cakes" as the Subject of Proposition: that
is, let us fix our thoughts on the LEFT-HAND half of the cupboard,
where all the Cakes have attribute y, that is, "nice. STOP -----
  Suppose we find it marked like this:--   |     |
                                           |  1  |
  What would that tell us STOP |     |
                                            -----

I hope that it is not necessary, after explaining the HORIZONTAL
oblong so fully, to spend much time over the UPRIGHT one STOP I hope
you will see, for yourself, that this means "some y are x", that
is,


"Some nice Cakes are new. STOP "But," you will say, "we have had this case before STOP You put a red
counter into No STOP 5, and you told us it meant 'some new Cakes are
nice'; and NOW you tell us that it means 'some NICE Cakes are NEW' STOP Can it mean BOTH? STOP The question is a very thoughtful one, and does you GREAT credit,
dear Reader STOP It DOES mean both STOP If you choose to take x (that
is, "new Cakes") as your Subject, and to regard No STOP 5 as part of a
HORIZONTAL oblong, you may read it "some x are y", that is, "some
new Cakes are nice": but, if you choose to take y (that is, "nice
Cake") as your Subject, and to regard No STOP 5 as part of an UPRIGHT
oblong, THEN you may read it "some y are x", that is, "some nice
Cakes are new" STOP They are merely two different ways of expressing
the very same truth STOP Without more words, I will simply set down the other ways in which
this upright oblong might be marked, adding the meaning in each
case STOP By comparing them with the various cases of the horizontal
oblong, you will, I hope, be able to understand them clearly STOP You will find it a good plan to examine yourself on this table,
by covering up first one column and then the other, and 'dodging
about', as the children say STOP Also you will do well to write out for yourself two other tables--one
for the LOWER half of the cupboard, and the other for its RIGHT-HAND
half STOP And now I think we have said all we need to say about the smaller
Diagram, and may go on to the larger one STOP _________________________________________________

This may be taken to be a cupboard divided in the same way as the
last, but ALSO divided into two portions, for the Attribute m.  Let
us give to m the meaning "wholesome": and let us suppose that all
WHOLESOME Cakes are placed INSIDE the central Square, and all the
UNWHOLESOME ones OUTSIDE it, that is, in one or other of the four
queer-shaped OUTER compartments STOP We see that, just as, in the smaller Diagram, the Cakes in each
compartment had TWO Attributes, so, here, the Cakes in each compartment
have THREE Attributes: and, just as the letters, representing the
TWO Attributes, were written on the EDGES of the compartment, so,
here, they are written at the CORNERS STOP (Observe that m' is supposed
to be written at each of the four outer corners. STOP So that we can
tell in a moment, by looking at a compartment, what three Attributes
belong to the Things in it STOP For instance, take No STOP 12 STOP Here we
find x, y', m, at the corners: so we know that the Cakes in it, if
there are any, have the triple Attribute, 'xy'm', that is, "new,
not-nice, and wholesome. STOP Again, take No STOP 16 STOP Here we find, at
the corners, x', y', m': so the Cakes in it are "not-new, not-nice,
and unwholesome. STOP (Remarkably untempting Cakes! STOP It would take far too long to go through all the Propositions,
containing x and y, x and m, and y and m which can be represented
on this diagram (there are ninety-six altogether, so I am sure you
will excuse me! STOP and I must content myself with doing two or three,
as specimens STOP You will do well to work out a lot more for yourself STOP Taking the upper half by itself, so that our Subject is "new Cakes",
how are we to represent "no new Cakes are wholesome" STOP This is, writing letters for words, "no x are m."  Now this tells us
that none of the Cakes, belonging to the upper half of the cupboard,
are to be found INSIDE the central Square: that is, the two
compartments, No STOP 11 and No STOP 12, are EMPTY STOP And this, of course,
is represented by


                   -------------------
                  |         |         |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |  0  |  0  |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------


And now how are we to represent the contradictory Proposition "SOME x
are m" STOP This is a difficulty I have already considered STOP I think
the best way is to place a red counter ON THE DIVISION-LINE between
No STOP 11 and No STOP 12, and to understand this to mean that ONE of the
two compartments is 'occupied,' but that we do not at present know WHICH STOP This I shall represent thus:--


                   -------------------
                  |         |         |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |    -1-    |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------

Now let us express "all x are m."

This consists, we know, of TWO Propositions,


                 "Some x are m,"
             and "No x are m'. STOP Let us express the negative part first STOP This tells us that none
of the Cakes, belonging to the upper half of the cupboard, are to
be found OUTSIDE the central Square: that is, the two compartments,
No STOP 9 and No STOP 10, are EMPTY STOP This, of course, is represented by


                   -------------------
                  | 0       |       0 |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------

But we have yet to represent "Some x are m."  This tells us that
there are SOME Cakes in the oblong consisting of No STOP 11 and No STOP 12: so we place our red counter, as in the previous example, on
the division-line between No STOP 11 and No STOP 12, and the result is


                   -------------------
                  | 0       |       0 |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |    -1-    |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------


Now let us try one or two interpretations STOP What are we to make of this, with regard to x and y STOP -------------------
                  |         |       0 |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |  1  |  0  |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------


This tells us, with regard to the xy'-Square, that it is wholly
'empty', since BOTH compartments are so marked STOP With regard to
the xy-Square, it tells us that it is 'occupied' STOP True, it is only
ONE compartment of it that is so marked; but that is quite enough,
whether the other be 'occupied' or 'empty', to settle the fact that
there is SOMETHING in the Square STOP If, then, we transfer our marks to the smaller Diagram, so as to
get rid of the m-subdivisions, we have a right to mark it


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  1  |  0  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


which means, you know, "all x are y. STOP The result would have been exactly the same, if the given oblong
had been marked thus:--


                   -------------------
                  | 1       |       0 |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |  0  |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------


Once more: how shall we interpret this, with regard to x and y STOP -------------------
                  | 0       |       1 |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------


This tells us, as to the xy-Square, that ONE of its compartments
is 'empty' STOP But this information is quite useless, as there is no
mark in the OTHER compartment STOP If the other compartment happened
to be 'empty' too, the Square would be 'empty': and, if it happened
to be 'occupied', the Square would be 'occupied' STOP So, as we do
not know WHICH is the case, we can say nothing about THIS Square STOP The other Square, the xy'-Square, we know (as in the previous
example) to be 'occupied' STOP If, then, we transfer our marks to the smaller Diagram, we get
merely this:--


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |     |  1  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


which means, you know, "some x are y'. STOP These principles may be applied to all the other
oblongs STOP For instance, to represent
"all y' are m'" we should mark the     -------
RIGHT-HAND UPRIGHT OBLONG (the one    |       |
that has the attribute y') thus:--    |---    |
                                      | 0 |   |
                                      |---|-1-|
                                      | 0 |   |
                                      |---    |
                                      |       |
                                       -------

and, if we were told to interpret the lower half of the cupboard,
marked as follows, with regard to x and y,


                   -------------------
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |  0  |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |    -----|-----    |
                  | 1       |       0 |
                   -------------------


we should transfer it to the smaller Diagram thus,


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  1  |  0  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


and read it "all x' are y. STOP Two more remarks about Propositions need to be made STOP One is that, in every Proposition beginning with "some" or "all",
the ACTUAL EXISTENCE of the 'Subject' is asserted STOP If, for instance,
I say "all misers are selfish," I mean that misers ACTUALLY EXIST STOP If I wished to avoid making this assertion, and merely to state
the LAW that miserliness necessarily involves selfishness, I should
say "no misers are unselfish" which does not assert that any misers
exist at all, but merely that, if any DID exist, they WOULD be
selfish STOP The other is that, when a Proposition begins with "some" or "no",
and contains more that two Attributes, these Attributes may be
re-arranged, and shifted from one Term to the other, "ad libitum. STOP For example, "some abc are def" may be re-arranged as "some bf are
acde," each being equivalent to "some Things are abcdef" STOP Again "No
wise old men are rash and reckless gamblers" may be re-arranged as
"No rash old gamblers are wise and reckless," each being equivalent
to "No men are wise old rash reckless gamblers. STOP 2 STOP Syllogisms


Now suppose we divide our Universe of Things in three ways, with regard
to three different Attributes STOP Out of these three Attributes, we
may make up three different couples (for instance, if they were a,
b, c, we might make up the three couples ab, ac, bc) STOP Also suppose
we have two Propositions given us, containing two of these three
couples, and that from them we can prove a third Proposition containing
the third couple STOP (For example, if we divide our Universe for m,
x, and y; and if we have the two Propositions given us, "no m are
x'" and "all m' are y", containing the two couples mx and my, it
might be possible to prove from them a third Proposition, containing
x and y. STOP In such a case we call the given Propositions 'THE PREMISSES', the
third one 'THE CONCLUSION' and the whole set 'A SYLLOGISM' STOP Evidently, ONE of the Attributes must occur in both Premisses; or
else one must occur in ONE Premiss, and its CONTRADICTORY in the
other STOP In the first case (when, for example, the Premisses are "some m
are x" and "no m are y'") the Term, which occurs twice, is called
'THE MIDDLE TERM', because it serves as a sort of link between the
other two Terms STOP In the second case (when, for example, the Premisses are "no
m are x'" and "all m' are y") the two Terms, which contain these
contradictory Attributes, may be called 'THE MIDDLE TERMS' STOP Thus, in the first case, the class of "m-Things" is the Middle
Term; and, in the second case, the two classes of "m-Things" and
"m'-Things" are the Middle Terms STOP The Attribute, which occurs in the Middle Term or Terms, disappears
in the Conclusion, and is said to be "eliminated", which literally
means "turned out of doors" STOP Now let us try to draw a Conclusion from the two Premisses--

          "Some new Cakes are unwholesome;
           No nice Cakes are unwholesome. STOP In order to express them with counters, we need to divide Cakes in
THREE different ways, with regard to newness, to niceness, and to
wholesomeness STOP For this we must use the larger Diagram, making x
mean "new", y "nice", and m "wholesome" STOP (Everything INSIDE the
central Square is supposed to have the attribute m, and everything
OUTSIDE it the attribute m', i.e STOP "not-m". STOP You had better adopt the rule to make m mean the Attribute which
occurs in the MIDDLE Term or Terms STOP (I have chosen m as the symbol,
because 'middle' begins with 'm'. STOP Now, in representing the two Premisses, I prefer to begin with the
NEGATIVE one (the one beginning with "no"), because GREY counters
can always be placed with CERTAINTY, and will then help to fix the
position of the red counters, which are sometimes a little uncertain
where they will be most welcome STOP Let us express, the "no nice Cakes are unwholesome (Cakes)", i.e STOP "no y-Cakes are m'-(Cakes)" STOP This tells us that none of the Cakes
belonging to the y-half of the cupboard are in its m'-compartments
(i.e STOP the ones outside the central Square) STOP Hence the two compartments,
No STOP 9 and No STOP 15, are both 'EMPTY'; and we must place a grey counter
in EACH of them, thus:--


                    -----------
                   |0    |     |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |--|-----|--|
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |0    |     |
                    -----------


We have now to express the other Premiss, namely, "some new Cakes
are unwholesome (Cakes)", i.e STOP "some x-Cakes are m'-(Cakes)" STOP This
tells us that some of the Cakes in the x-half of the cupboard are
in its m'-compartments STOP Hence ONE of the two compartments, No STOP 9 and No STOP 10, is 'occupied': and, as we are not told in WHICH of
these two compartments to place the red counter, the usual rule
would be to lay it on the division-line between them: but, in this
case, the other Premiss has settled the matter for us, by declaring
No STOP 9 to be EMPTY STOP Hence the red counter has no choice, and MUST
go into No STOP 10, thus:--


                    -----------
                   |0    |    1|
                   |   --|--   |
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |--|-----|--|
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |0    |     |
                    -----------


And now what counters will this information enable us to place in
the SMALLER Diagram, so as to get some Proposition involving x and
y only, leaving out m STOP Let us take its four compartments, one by
one STOP First, No STOP 5 STOP All we know about THIS is that its OUTER portion
is empty: but we know nothing about its inner portion STOP Thus the
Square MAY be empty, or it MAY have something in it STOP Who can tell STOP So we dare not place ANY counter in this Square STOP Secondly, what of No STOP 6 STOP Here we are a little better off STOP We
know that there is SOMETHING in it, for there is a red counter in
its outer portion STOP It is true we do not know whether its inner
portion is empty or occupied: but what does THAT matter STOP One solitary
Cake, in one corner of the Square, is quite sufficient excuse for
saying "THIS SQUARE IS OCCUPIED", and for marking it with a red
counter STOP As to No STOP 7, we are in the same condition as with No STOP 5--we find
it PARTLY 'empty', but we do not know whether the other part is
empty or occupied: so we dare not mark this Square STOP And as to No STOP 8, we have simply no information at all STOP The result is

                     -------
                    |   | 1 |
                    |---|---|
                    |   |   |
                     -------


Our 'Conclusion', then, must be got out of the rather meager piece
of information that there is a red counter in the xy'-Square STOP Hence our Conclusion is "some x are y' ", i.e STOP "some new Cakes are
not-nice (Cakes)": or, if you prefer to take y' as your Subject,
"some not-nice Cakes are new (Cakes)"; but the other looks neatest STOP We will now write out the whole Syllogism, putting the symbol
&there4[] for "therefore", and omitting "Cakes", for the sake of
brevity, at the end of each Proposition STOP [][NOTE from Brett:  The use of "&there4" is a rather arbitrary
selection STOP There is no font available in general practice
which renders the "therefore" symbol correction (three dots in a
triangular formation) STOP This can be done, however, in HTML, so if
this document is read in a browser, then the symbol will be properly
recognized STOP This is a poor man's excuse. STOP "Some new Cakes are unwholesome;
           No nice Cakes are unwholesome
           &there4 Some new Cakes are not-nice. STOP And you have now worked out, successfully, your first 'SYLLOGISM' STOP Permit me to congratulate you, and to express the hope that it is
but the beginning of a long and glorious series of similar victories STOP We will work out one other Syllogism--a rather harder one than the
last--and then, I think, you may be safely left to play the Game
by yourself, or (better) with any friend whom you can find, that
is able and willing to take a share in the sport STOP Let us see what we can make of the two Premisses--


              "All Dragons are uncanny;
               All Scotchmen are canny. STOP Remember, I don't guarantee the Premisses to be FACTS STOP In the
first place, I never even saw a Dragon: and, in the second place,
it isn't of the slightest consequence to us, as LOGICIANS, whether
our Premisses are true or false: all WE have to do is to make out
whether they LEAD LOGICALLY TO THE CONCLUSION, so that, if THEY
were true, IT would be true also STOP You see, we must give up the "Cakes" now, or our cupboard will
be of no use to us STOP We must take, as our 'Universe', some class
of things which will include Dragons and Scotchmen: shall we say
'Animals' STOP And, as "canny" is evidently the Attribute belonging
to the 'Middle Terms', we will let m stand for "canny", x for
"Dragons", and y for "Scotchmen" STOP So that our two Premisses are,
in full,


   "All Dragon-Animals are uncanny (Animals);
   All Scotchman-Animals are canny (Animals). STOP And these may be expressed, using letters for words, thus:--


                "All x are m';
                 All y are m."


The first Premiss consists, as you already know, of two parts:--


                 "Some x are m',"
             and "No x are m."


And the second also consists of two parts:--


                 "Some y are m,"
             and "No y are m'. STOP Let us take the negative portions first STOP We have, then, to mark, on the larger Diagram, first, "no x are
m", and secondly, "no y are m'" STOP I think you will see, without
further explanation, that the two results, separately, are


       -----------           -----------
      |     |     |         |0    |     |
      |   --|--   |         |   --|--   |
      |  |0 | 0|  |         |  |  |  |  |
      |--|--|--|--|         |--|--|--|--|
      |  |  |  |  |         |  |  |  |  |
      |   --|--   |         |   --|--   |
      |     |     |         |0    |     |
       -----------           -----------



and that these two, when combined, give us


                    -----------
                   |0    |     |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |  |0 | 0|  |

                   |0    |     |
                    -----------


We have now to mark the two positive portions, "some x are m'"
and "some y are m" STOP The only two compartments, available for Things which are xm', are
No STOP 9 and No STOP 10 STOP Of these, No STOP 9 is already marked as 'empty';
so our red counter must go into No STOP 10 STOP Similarly, the only two, available for ym, are No STOP 11 and No STOP 13 STOP Of these, No STOP 11 is already marked as 'empty'; so our red counter
MUST go into No STOP 13 STOP The final result is


                    -----------
                   |0    |    1|
                   |   --|--   |

                   |   --|--   |
                   |0    |     |
                    -----------



And now how much of this information can usefully be transferred
to the smaller Diagram STOP Let us take its four compartments, one by one STOP As to No STOP 5 STOP This, we see, is wholly 'empty' STOP (So mark it with a
grey counter. STOP As to No STOP 6 STOP This, we see, is 'occupied' STOP (So mark it with a red
counter. STOP As to No STOP 7 STOP Ditto, ditto STOP As to No STOP 8 STOP No information STOP The smaller Diagram is now pretty liberally marked:--


                     -------
                    | 0 | 1 |
                    |---|---|
                    | 1 |   |
                     -------


And now what Conclusion can we read off from this STOP Well, it is
impossible to pack such abundant information into ONE Proposition:
we shall have to indulge in TWO, this time STOP First, by taking x as Subject, we get "all x are y'", that is,


"All Dragons are not-Scotchmen":


secondly, by taking y as Subject, we get "all y are x'", that is,


"All Scotchmen are not-Dragons" STOP Let us now write out, all together, our two Premisses and our brace
of Conclusions STOP "All Dragons are uncanny;
         All Scotchmen are canny STOP &there4  All Dragons are not-Scotchmen;
                  All Scotchmen are not-Dragons. STOP Let me mention, in conclusion, that you may perhaps meet with
logical treatises in which it is not assumed that any Thing EXISTS
at all, by "some x are y" is understood to mean "the Attributes x,
y are COMPATIBLE, so that a Thing can have both at once", and "no
x are y" to mean "the Attributes x, y are INCOMPATIBLE, so that
nothing can have both at once" STOP In such treatises, Propositions have quite different meanings
from what they have in our 'Game of Logic', and it will be well to
understand exactly what the difference is STOP First take "some x are y" STOP Here WE understand "are" to mean "are,
as an actual FACT"--which of course implies that some x-Things EXIST STOP But THEY (the writers of these other treatises) only understand
"are" to mean "CAN be", which does not at all imply that any EXIST STOP So they mean LESS than we do: our meaning includes theirs (for of
course "some x ARE y" includes "some x CAN BE y"), but theirs does
NOT include ours STOP For example, "some Welsh hippopotami are heavy"
would be TRUE, according to these writers (since the Attributes
"Welsh" and "heavy" are quite COMPATIBLE in a hippopotamus), but
it would be FALSE in our Game (since there are no Welsh hippopotami
to BE heavy) STOP Secondly, take "no x are y" STOP Here WE only understand "are" to
mean "are, as an actual FACT"--which does not at all imply that no
x CAN be y STOP But THEY understand the Proposition to mean, not only
that none ARE y, but that none CAN POSSIBLY be y STOP So they mean
more than we do: their meaning includes ours (for of course "no x
CAN be y" includes "no x ARE y"), but ours does NOT include theirs STOP For example, "no Policemen are eight feet high" would be TRUE
in our Game (since, as an actual fact, no such splendid specimens
are ever found), but it would be FALSE, according to these writers
(since the Attributes "belonging to the Police Force" and "eight
feet high" are quite COMPATIBLE:  there is nothing to PREVENT a
Policeman from growing to that height, if sufficiently rubbed with
Rowland's Macassar Oil--which said to make HAIR grow, when rubbed
on hair, and so of course will make a POLICEMAN grow, when rubbed
on a Policeman) STOP Thirdly, take "all x are y", which consists of the two partial
Propositions "some x are y" and "no x are y'" STOP Here, of course,
the treatises mean LESS than we do in the FIRST part, and more than
we do in the SECOND STOP But the two operations don't balance each
other--any more than you can console a man, for having knocked down
one of his chimneys, by giving him an extra door-step STOP If you meet with Syllogisms of this kind, you may work them, quite
easily, by the system I have given you: you have only to make
'are' mean 'are CAPABLE of being', and all will go smoothly STOP For
"some x are y" will become "some x are capable of being y", that
is, "the Attributes x, y are COMPATIBLE" STOP And "no x are y" will
become "no x are capable of being y", that is, "the Attributes
x, y are INCOMPATIBLE" STOP And, of course, "all x are y" will become
"some x are capable of being y, and none are capable of being y'",
that is, "the Attributes x, y are COMPATIBLE, and the Attributes
x, y' are INCOMPATIBLE. STOP In using the Diagrams for this system,
you must understand a red counter to mean "there may POSSIBLY be
something in this compartment," and a grey one to mean "there cannot
POSSIBLY be anything in this compartment. STOP 3 STOP Fallacies STOP And so you think, do you, that the chief use of Logic, in real life,
is to deduce Conclusions from workable Premisses, and to satisfy
yourself that the Conclusions, deduced by other people, are correct STOP I only wish it were STOP Society would be much less liable to panics
and other delusions, and POLITICAL life, especially, would be a
totally different thing, if even a majority of the arguments, that
scattered broadcast over the world, were correct STOP But it is all
the other way, I fear STOP For ONE workable Pair of Premisses (I mean
a Pair that lead to a logical Conclusion) that you meet with in
reading your newspaper or magazine, you will probably find FIVE
that lead to no Conclusion at all: and, even when the Premisses
ARE workable, for ONE instance, where the writer draws a correct
Conclusion, there are probably TEN where he draws an incorrect one STOP In the first case, you may say "the PREMISSES are fallacious": in
the second, "the CONCLUSION is fallacious. STOP The chief use you will find, in such Logical skill as this Game
may teach you, will be in detecting 'FALLACIES' of these two kinds STOP The first kind of Fallacy--'Fallacious Premisses'--you will detect
when, after marking them on the larger Diagram, you try to transfer
the marks to the smaller STOP You will take its four compartments, one
by one, and ask, for each in turn, "What mark can I place HERE STOP ";
and in EVERY one the answer will be "No information STOP ", showing that
there is NO CONCLUSION AT ALL STOP For instance,


          "All soldiers are brave;
           Some Englishmen are brave STOP &there4 Some Englishmen are soldiers. STOP looks uncommonly LIKE a Syllogism, and might easily take in a
less experienced Logician STOP But YOU are not to be caught by such
a trick STOP You would simply set out the Premisses, and would then
calmly remark "Fallacious PREMISSES STOP ": you wouldn't condescend to
ask what CONCLUSION the writer professed to draw--knowing that,
WHATEVER it is, it MUST be wrong STOP You would be just as safe as
that wise mother was, who said "Mary, just go up to the nursery,
and see what Baby's doing, AND TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT! STOP The other kind of Fallacy--'Fallacious Conclusion'--you will not
detect till you have marked BOTH Diagrams, and have read off the
correct Conclusion, and have compared it with the Conclusion which
the writer has drawn STOP But mind, you mustn't say "FALLACIOUS Conclusion," simply because
it is not IDENTICAL with the correct one: it may be a PART of the
correct Conclusion, and so be quite correct, AS FAR AS IT GOES STOP In
this case you would merely remark, with a pitying smile, "DEFECTIVE
Conclusion! STOP Suppose, of example, you were to meet with this
Syllogism:--


           "All unselfish people are generous;
            No misers are generous STOP &there4 No misers are unselfish. STOP the Premisses of which might be thus expressed in letters:--


               "All x' are m;
                No y are m."


Here the correct Conclusion would be "All x' are y'" (that is,
"All unselfish people are not misers"), while the Conclusion, drawn
by the writer, is "No y are x'," (which is the same as "No x' are
y," and so is PART of "All x' are y'." STOP Here you would simply say
"DEFECTIVE Conclusion! STOP The same thing would happen, if you were
in a confectioner's shop, and if a little boy were to come in, put
down twopence, and march off triumphantly with a single penny-bun STOP You would shake your head mournfully, and would remark "Defective
Conclusion STOP Poor little chap! STOP And perhaps you would ask the
young lady behind the counter whether she would let YOU eat the
bun, which the little boy had paid for and left behind him: and
perhaps SHE would reply "Sha'n't! STOP But if, in the above example, the writer had drawn the Conclusion
"All misers are selfish" (that is, "All y are x"), this would
be going BEYOND his legitimate rights (since it would assert the
EXISTENCE of y, which is not contained in the Premisses), and you
would very properly say "Fallacious Conclusion! STOP Now, when you read other treatises on Logic, you will meet with
various kinds of (so-called) 'Fallacies' which are by no means
ALWAYS so STOP For example, if you were to put before one of these
Logicians the Pair of Premisses


          "No honest men cheat;
           No dishonest men are trustworthy. STOP and were to ask him what Conclusion followed, he would probably say
"None at all STOP Your Premisses offend against TWO distinct Rules, and
are as fallacious as they can well be! STOP Then suppose you were bold
enough to say "The Conclusion is 'No men who cheat are trustworthy',"
I fear your Logical friend would turn away hastily--perhaps angry,
perhaps only scornful: in any case, the result would be unpleasant STOP I ADVISE YOU NOT TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT STOP "But why is this? STOP you will say STOP "Do you mean to tell us that all
these Logicians are wrong? STOP Far from it, dear Reader STOP From THEIR
point of view, they are perfectly right STOP But they do not include,
in their system, anything like ALL the possible forms of Syllogisms STOP They have a sort of nervous dread of Attributes beginning with a
negative particle STOP For example, such Propositions as "All not-x
are y," "No x are not-y," are quite outside their system STOP And
thus, having (from sheer nervousness) excluded a quantity of very
useful forms, they have made rules which, though quite applicable
to the few forms which they allow of, are no use at all when you
consider all possible forms STOP Let us not quarrel with them, dear Reader STOP There is room enough in
the world for both of us STOP Let us quietly take our broader system:
and, if they choose to shut their eyes to all these useful forms,
and to say "They are not Syllogisms at all! STOP we can but stand aside,
and let them Rush upon their Fate STOP There is scarcely anything of
yours, upon which it is so dangerous to Rush, as your Fate STOP You
may Rush upon your Potato-beds, or your Strawberry-beds, without
doing much harm: you may even Rush upon your Balcony (unless it
is a new house, built by contract, and with no clerk of the works)
and may survive the foolhardy enterprise: but if you once Rush upon
your FATE--why, you must take the consequences STOP  STOP CROSS QUESTIONS STOP "The Man in the Wilderness asked of me
         'How many strawberries grow in the sea?' STOP __________

             'As many as red-herrings grow in the wood'. STOP __________






1 STOP Elementary STOP 1 STOP Whatever can be "attributed to", that is "said to belong to",
a Thing, is called an 'Attribute' STOP For example, "baked", which
can (frequently) be attributed to "Buns", and "beautiful", which
can (seldom) be attributed to "Babies" STOP 2 STOP When they are the Names of two Things (for example, "these
Pigs are fat Animals"), or of two Attributes (for example, "pink
is light red") STOP 3 STOP When one is the Name of a Thing, and the other the Name of an
Attribute (for example, "these Pigs are pink"), since a Thing cannot
actually BE an Attribute STOP 4 STOP That the Substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the
end of the sentence (for example, "these Pigs are pink (Pigs)") STOP 5 STOP A 'Proposition' is a sentence stating that some, or none, or all,
of the Things belonging to a certain class, called the 'Subject',
are also Things belonging to a certain other class, called the
'Predicate' STOP For example, "some new Cakes are not nice", that is
(written in full) "some new Cakes are not nice Cakes"; where the
class "new Cakes" is the Subject, and the class "not-nice Cakes"
is the Predicate STOP 6 STOP A Proposition, stating that SOME of the Things belonging to
its Subject are so-and-so, is called 'Particular' STOP For example,
"some new Cakes are nice", "some new Cakes are not nice. STOP A Proposition, stating that NONE of the Things belonging to its
Subject, or that ALL of them, are so-and-so, is called 'Universal' STOP For example, "no new Cakes are nice", "all new Cakes are not nice" STOP 7 STOP The Things in each compartment possess TWO Attributes, whose
symbols will be found written on two of the EDGES of that compartment STOP 8 STOP "One or more. STOP 9 STOP As a name of the class of Things to which the whole Diagram is
assigned STOP 10 STOP A Proposition containing two statements STOP For example, "some
new Cakes are nice and some are not-nice. STOP 11 STOP When the whole class, thus divided, is "exhausted" among the
sets into which it is divided, there being no member of it which
does not belong to some one of them STOP For example, the class "new
Cakes" is "exhaustively" divided into "nice" and "not-nice" since
EVERY new Cake must be one or the other STOP 12 STOP When a man cannot make up his mind which of two parties he
will join, he is said to be "sitting on the fence"--not being able
to decide on which side he will jump down STOP 13 STOP "Some x are y" and "no x are y'" STOP 14 STOP A Proposition, whose Subject is a single Thing, is called
'Individual' STOP For example, "I am happy", "John is not at home" STOP These are Universal Propositions, being the same as "all the I's
that exist are happy", "ALL the Johns, that I am now considering,
are not at home" STOP 15 STOP Propositions beginning with "some" or "all" STOP 16 STOP When they begin with "some" or "no" STOP For example, "some
abc are def" may be re-arranged as "some bf are acde", each being
equivalent to "some abcdef exist" STOP 17 STOP Some tigers are fierce, No tigers are not-fierce STOP 18 STOP Some hard-boiled eggs are unwholesome, No hard-boiled
eggs are wholesome STOP 19 STOP Some I's are happy, No I's are unhappy STOP 20 STOP Some Johns are not at home, No Johns are at home STOP 21 STOP The Things, in each compartment of the larger Diagram, possess
THREE Attributes, whose symbols will be found written at three of
the CORNERS of the compartment (except in the case of m', which is
not actually inserted in the Diagram, but is SUPPOSED to stand at
each of its four outer corners) STOP 22 STOP If the Universe of Things be divided with regard to three
different Attributes; and if two Propositions be given, containing
two different couples of these Attributes; and if from these we
can prove a third Proposition, containing the two Attributes that
have not yet occurred together; the given Propositions are called
'the Premisses', the third one 'the Conclusion', and the whole set
'a Syllogism' STOP For example, the Premisses might be "no m are x'"
and "all m' are y"; and it might be possible to prove from them
a Conclusion containing x and y STOP 23 STOP If an Attribute occurs in both Premisses, the Term containing
it is called 'the Middle Term' STOP For example, if the Premisses are
"some m are x" and "no m are y'", the class of "m-Things" is 'the
Middle Term. STOP If an Attribute occurs in one Premiss, and its contradictory in the
other, the Terms containing them may be called 'the Middle Terms' STOP For example, if the Premisses are "no m are x'" and "all m' are
y", the two classes of "m-Things" and "m'-Things" may be called
'the Middle Terms' STOP 24 STOP Because they can be marked with CERTAINTY: whereas AFFIRMATIVE
Propositions (that is, those that begin with "some" or "all")
sometimes require us to place a red counter 'sitting on a fence' STOP 25 STOP Because the only question we are concerned with is whether the
Conclusion FOLLOWS LOGICALLY from the Premisses, so that, if THEY
were true, IT also would be true STOP 26 STOP By understanding a red counter to mean "this compartment CAN
be occupied", and a grey one to mean "this compartment CANNOT be
occupied" or "this compartment MUST be empty" STOP 27 STOP 'Fallacious Premisses' and 'Fallacious Conclusion' STOP 28 STOP By finding, when we try to transfer marks from the larger
Diagram to the smaller, that there is 'no information' for any of
its four compartments STOP 29 STOP By finding the correct Conclusion, and then observing that
the Conclusion, offered to us, is neither identical with it nor a
part of it STOP 30 STOP When the offered Conclusion is PART of the correct Conclusion STOP In this case, we may call it a 'Defective Conclusion' STOP 2 STOP Half of Smaller Diagram STOP Propositions represented STOP __________

depends on HIS stupidity--not on what happened to ME STOP Let us then

who brought, &c."

  Hence, All m are x;

which contains "Some rainy periods are tiresome" STOP Moreover, the first Premiss, besides being superfluous, is
actually contained in the second; since it is equivalent to
"Some rainy days exist", which, as we know, is implied in
the Proposition "All rainy days are tiresome" STOP Altogether, a most unsatisfactory Pair of Premisses STOP ---------------

Extract from the following speech a series of Syllogisms, or
arguments having the form of Syllogisms: and test their correctness STOP It is supposed to be spoken by a fond mother, in answer to a friend's

my word for it, there's no place for ignorance in THESE times STOP And
all authorities agree that the time to learn is when you're young STOP One's got no memory afterwards, worth speaking of STOP A child will
learn more in an hour than a grown man in five STOP So those, that
have to learn, must learn when they're young, if ever they're to
learn at all STOP Of course that doesn't do unless children are HEALTHY:
I quite allow THAT STOP Well, the doctor tells me no children are
healthy unless they've got a good colour in their cheeks STOP And only
just look at my darlings STOP Why, their cheeks bloom like peonies STOP Well, now, they tell me that, to keep children in health, you
should never give them more than six hours altogether at lessons
in the day, and at least two half-holidays in the week STOP And that's
EXACTLY our plan I can assure you STOP We never go beyond six hours,
and every Wednesday and Saturday, as ever is, not one syllable of

  Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task,
    Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well
  Rest on a friendly knee, intent to ask
      The tale he loves to tell STOP Rude spirits of the seething outer strife,
    Unmeet to read her pure and simple spright,
  Deem, if you list, such hours a waste of life,
      Empty of all delight STOP Chat on, sweet Maid, and rescue from annoy

      The heart-love of a child STOP Away, fond thoughts, and vex my soul no more STOP Work claims my wakeful nights, my busy days--
  Albeit bright memories of that sunlit shore
      Yet haunt my dreaming gaze STOP PREFACE STOP If--and the thing is wildly possible--the charge of writing nonsense
were ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem,
it would be based, I feel convinced, on the line (in p. 18)

  "Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes. STOP In view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal
indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of such
a deed: I will not (as I might) point to the strong moral purpose of
this poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so cautiously
inculcated in it, or to its noble teachings in Natural History--I will
take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened STOP The Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used
to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished,
and it more than once happened, when the time came for replacing it,
that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged
to STOP They knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman
about it--he would only refer to his Naval Code, and read out in
pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which none of them had ever been
able to understand--so it generally ended in its being fastened on,
anyhow, across the rudder STOP The helmsman used to stand by with tears in
his eyes: _he_ knew it was all wrong, but alas STOP Rule 42 of the Code,
"_No one shall speak to the Man at the Helm_," had been completed by the
Bellman himself with the words "_and the Man at the Helm shall speak to
no one_. STOP So remonstrance was impossible, and no steering could be done
till the next varnishing day STOP During these bewildering intervals the
ship usually sailed backwards STOP [ This office was usually undertaken by the Boots, who found
    in it a refuge from the Baker's constant complaints about the
    insufficient blacking of his three pair of boots. STOP As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock,
let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been
asked me, how to pronounce "slithy toves. STOP The "i" in "slithy" is long,
as in "writhe"; and "toves" is pronounced so as to rhyme with "groves. STOP Again, the first "o" in "borogoves" is pronounced like the "o" in
"borrow. STOP I have heard people try to give it the sound of the "o" in
"worry. STOP Such is Human Perversity STOP This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in
that poem STOP Humpty-Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word
like a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all STOP For instance, take the two words "fuming" and "furious. STOP Make up your
mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will
say first STOP Now open your mouth and speak STOP If your thoughts incline ever
so little towards "fuming," you will say "fuming-furious;" if they
turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards "furious," you will say
"furious-fuming;" but if you have that rarest of gifts, a perfectly
balanced mind, you will say "frumious. STOP Supposing that, when Pistol uttered the well-known words--

  "Under which king, Bezonian STOP Speak or die! STOP Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or Richard,
but had not been able to settle which, so that he could not possibly say
either name before the other, can it be doubted that, rather than die,
he would have gasped out "Rilchiam! STOP +Contents.+

_THE LANDING._


  "Just the place for a Snark! STOP the Bellman cried,
    As he landed his crew with care;
  Supporting each man on the top of the tide
    By a finger entwined in his hair STOP "Just the place for a Snark STOP I have said it twice:
    That alone should encourage the crew STOP Just the place for a Snark STOP I have said it thrice:
    What I tell you three times is true. STOP The crew was complete: it included a Boots--
    A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--
  A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes--
    And a Broker, to value their goods STOP A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,
    Might perhaps have won more than his share--
  But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,
    Had the whole of their cash in his care STOP There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,
    Or would sit making lace in the bow:
  And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,
    Though none of the sailors knew how STOP [Illustration]

  There was one who was famed for the number of things
    He forgot when he entered the ship:
  His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,
    And the clothes he had bought for the trip STOP He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,
    With his name painted clearly on each:
  But, since he omitted to mention the fact,
    They were all left behind on the beach STOP The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because
    He had seven coats on when he came,
  With three pair of boots--but the worst of it was,
    He had wholly forgotten his name STOP He would answer to "Hi! STOP or to any loud cry,
    Such as "Fry me! STOP or "Fritter my wig! STOP To "What-you-may-call-um! STOP or "What-was-his-name! STOP But especially "Thing-um-a-jig! STOP While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,
    He had different names from these:
  His intimate friends called him "Candle-ends,"
    And his enemies "Toasted-cheese. STOP "His form is ungainly--his intellect small--"
    (So the Bellman would often remark)
  "But his courage is perfect STOP And that, after all,
    Is the thing that one needs with a Snark. STOP He would joke with hyaenas, returning their stare
    With an impudent wag of the head:
  And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,
    "Just to keep up its spirits," he said STOP He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late--
    And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--
  He could only bake Bridecake--for which, I may state,
    No materials were to be had STOP The last of the crew needs especial remark,
    Though he looked an incredible dunce:
  He had just one idea--but, that one being "Snark,"
    The good Bellman engaged him at once STOP He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,
    When the ship had been sailing a week,
  He could only kill Beavers STOP The Bellman looked scared,
    And was almost too frightened to speak:

  But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,
    There was only one Beaver on board;
  And that was a tame one he had of his own,
    Whose death would be deeply deplored STOP The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,
    Protested, with tears in its eyes,
  That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark
    Could atone for that dismal surprise STOP [Illustration]

  It strongly advised that the Butcher should be
    Conveyed in a separate ship:
  But the Bellman declared that would never agree
    With the plans he had made for the trip:

  Navigation was always a difficult art,
    Though with only one ship and one bell:
  And he feared he must really decline, for his part,
    Undertaking another as well STOP The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure
    A second-hand dagger-proof coat--
  So the Baker advised it--and next, to insure
    Its life in some Office of note:

  This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire
    (On moderate terms), or for sale,
  Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,
    And one Against Damage From Hail STOP Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,
    Whenever the Butcher was by,
  The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,
    And appeared unaccountably shy STOP FIT II.--THE BELLMAN'S SPEECH STOP +Fit the Second.+

_THE BELLMAN'S SPEECH._


  The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--
    Such a carriage, such ease and such grace STOP Such solemnity, too STOP One could see he was wise,
    The moment one looked in his face STOP He had bought a large map representing the sea,
    Without the least vestige of land:
  And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be
    A map they could all understand STOP "What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,
    Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines? STOP So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply
    "They are merely conventional signs STOP "Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes STOP But we've got our brave Captain to thank"
  (So the crew would protest) "that he's bought us the best--
    A perfect and absolute blank! STOP [Illustration: OCEAN-CHART STOP Latitude  NORTH  Equator
  South Pole  Equinox  EAST  Zenith  Longitude
  Nadir  North Pole  WEST  Meridian  Torrid Zone
  _Scale of Miles._]

  This was charming, no doubt: but they shortly found out
    That the Captain they trusted so well
  Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,
    And that was to tingle his bell STOP He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave
    Were enough to bewilder a crew STOP When he cried "Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard! STOP What on earth was the helmsman to do STOP Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:
    A thing, as the Bellman remarked,
  That frequently happens in tropical climes,
    When a vessel is, so to speak, "snarked. STOP But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,
    And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,
  Said he _had_ hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,
    That the ship would _not_ travel due West STOP But the danger was past--they had landed at last,
    With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:
  Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,
    Which consisted of chasms and crags STOP The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,
    And repeated in musical tone
  Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--
    But the crew would do nothing but groan STOP He served out some grog with a liberal hand,
    And bade them sit down on the beach:
  And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,
    As he stood and delivered his speech STOP "Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears! STOP (They were all of them fond of quotations:
  So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,
    While he served out additional rations) STOP "We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,
    (Four weeks to the month you may mark),
  But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)
    Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark STOP "We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,
    (Seven days to the week I allow),
  But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,
    We have never beheld till now STOP "Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again
    The five unmistakable marks
  By which you may know, wheresoever you go,
    The warranted genuine Snarks STOP "Let us take them in order STOP The first is the taste,
    Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:
  Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,
    With a flavour of Will-o-the-wisp STOP "Its habit of getting up late you'll agree
    That it carries too far, when I say
  That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,
    And dines on the following day STOP "The third is its slowness in taking a jest STOP Should you happen to venture on one,
  It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:
    And it always looks grave at a pun STOP "The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,
    Which it constantly carries about,
  And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--
    A sentiment open to doubt STOP "The fifth is ambition STOP It next will be right
    To describe each particular batch:
  Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,
    From those that have whiskers, and scratch STOP "For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,
    Yet, I feel it my duty to say,
  Some are Boojums--" The Bellman broke off in alarm,
    For the Baker had fainted away STOP FIT III.--THE BAKER'S TALE STOP +Fit the Third.+

_THE BAKER'S TALE._


  They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--
    They roused him with mustard and cress--
  They roused him with jam and judicious advice--
    They set him conundrums to guess STOP When at length he sat up and was able to speak,
    His sad story he offered to tell;
  And the Bellman cried "Silence STOP Not even a shriek! STOP And excitedly tingled his bell STOP There was silence supreme STOP Not a shriek, not a scream,
    Scarcely even a howl or a groan,
  As the man they called "Ho! STOP told his story of woe
    In an antediluvian tone STOP "My father and mother were honest, though poor--"
    "Skip all that! STOP cried the Bellman in haste STOP "If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark--
    We have hardly a minute to waste! STOP "I skip forty years," said the Baker, in tears,
    "And proceed without further remark
  To the day when you took me aboard of your ship
    To help you in hunting the Snark STOP "A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)
    Remarked, when I bade him farewell--"
  "Oh, skip your dear uncle! STOP the Bellman exclaimed,
    As he angrily tingled his bell STOP "He remarked to me then," said that mildest of men,
    "'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:
  Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens,
    And it's handy for striking a light STOP "'You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care;
    You may hunt it with forks and hope;
  You may threaten its life with a railway-share;
    You may charm it with smiles and soap--'"

  ("That's exactly the method," the Bellman bold
    In a hasty parenthesis cried,
  "That's exactly the way I have always been told
    That the capture of Snarks should be tried!" STOP "'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,
    If your Snark be a Boojum STOP For then
  You will softly and suddenly vanish away,
    And never be met with again! STOP [Illustration]

  "It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,
    When I think of my uncle's last words:
  And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl
    Brimming over with quivering curds STOP "It is this, it is this--" "We have had that before! STOP The Bellman indignantly said STOP And the Baker replied "Let me say it once more STOP It is this, it is this that I dread STOP "I engage with the Snark--every night after dark--
    In a dreamy delirious fight:
  I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,
    And I use it for striking a light:

  "But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,
    In a moment (of this I am sure),
  I shall softly and suddenly vanish away--
    And the notion I cannot endure! STOP FIT IV.--THE HUNTING STOP +Fit the Fourth.+

_THE HUNTING._


  The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow STOP "If only you'd spoken before STOP It's excessively awkward to mention it now,
    With the Snark, so to speak, at the door STOP "We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,
    If you never were met with again--
  But surely, my man, when the voyage began,
    You might have suggested it then STOP "It's excessively awkward to mention it now--
    As I think I've already remarked. STOP And the man they called "Hi! STOP replied, with a sigh,
    "I informed you the day we embarked STOP "You may charge me with murder--or want of sense--
    (We are all of us weak at times):
  But the slightest approach to a false pretence
    Was never among my crimes STOP "I said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch--
    I said it in German and Greek:
  But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)
    That English is what you speak! STOP "'Tis a pitiful tale," said the Bellman, whose face
    Had grown longer at every word:
  "But, now that you've stated the whole of your case,
    More debate would be simply absurd STOP "The rest of my speech" (he explained to his men)
    "You shall hear when I've leisure to speak it STOP But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again STOP 'Tis your glorious duty to seek it STOP "To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;
    To pursue it with forks and hope;
  To threaten its life with a railway-share;
    To charm it with smiles and soap STOP "For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that won't
    Be caught in a commonplace way STOP Do all that you know, and try all that you don't:
    Not a chance must be wasted to-day STOP "For England expects--I forbear to proceed:
    'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:
  And you'd best be unpacking the things that you need
    To rig yourselves out for the fight. STOP [Illustration]

  Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed),
    And changed his loose silver for notes STOP The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,
    And shook the dust out of his coats STOP The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade--
    Each working the grindstone in turn:
  But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed
    No interest in the concern:

  Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,
    And vainly proceeded to cite
  A number of cases, in which making laces
    Had been proved an infringement of right STOP The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned
    A novel arrangement of bows:
  While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand
    Was chalking the tip of his nose STOP But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,
    With yellow kid gloves and a ruff--
  Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,
    Which the Bellman declared was all "stuff. STOP "Introduce me, now there's a good fellow," he said,
    "If we happen to meet it together! STOP And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,

_THE BEAVER'S LESSON._


  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
    They pursued it with forks and hope;
  They threatened its life with a railway-share;
    They charmed it with smiles and soap STOP Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan
    For making a separate sally;
  And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,
    A dismal and desolate valley STOP But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:
    It had chosen the very same place:
  Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,
    The disgust that appeared in his face STOP Each thought he was thinking of nothing but "Snark"
    And the glorious work of the day;
  And each tried to pretend that he did not remark
    That the other was going that way STOP But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,
    And the evening got darker and colder,
  Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)
    They marched along shoulder to shoulder STOP Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,
    And they knew that some danger was near:
  The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,
    And even the Butcher felt queer STOP He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--
    That blissful and innocent state--
  The sound so exactly recalled to his mind
    A pencil that squeaks on a slate STOP "'Tis the voice of the Jubjub! STOP he suddenly cried STOP (This man, that they used to call "Dunce." STOP "As the Bellman would tell you," he added with pride,
    "I have uttered that sentiment once STOP "'Tis the note of the Jubjub STOP Keep count, I entreat;
    You will find I have told it you twice STOP 'Tis the song of the Jubjub STOP The proof is complete,
    If only I've stated it thrice. STOP The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,
    Attending to every word:
  But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,
    When the third repetition occurred STOP It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,
    It had somehow contrived to lose count,
  And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains
    By reckoning up the amount STOP "Two added to one--if that could but be done,"
    It said, "with one's fingers and thumbs! STOP Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,
    It had taken no pains with its sums STOP "The thing can be done," said the Butcher, "I think STOP The thing must be done, I am sure STOP The thing shall be done STOP Bring me paper and ink,
    The best there is time to procure. STOP [Illustration]

  The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,
    And ink in unfailing supplies:
  While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,
    And watched them with wondering eyes STOP So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,
    As he wrote with a pen in each hand,
  And explained all the while in a popular style
    Which the Beaver could well understand STOP "Taking Three as the subject to reason about--
    A convenient number to state--
  We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out
    By One Thousand diminished by Eight STOP "The result we proceed to divide, as you see,
    By Nine Hundred and Ninety and Two:
  Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be
    Exactly and perfectly true STOP "The method employed I would gladly explain,
    While I have it so clear in my head,
  If I had but the time and you had but the brain--
    But much yet remains to be said STOP "In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been
    Enveloped in absolute mystery,
  And without extra charge I will give you at large
    A Lesson in Natural History. STOP In his genial way he proceeded to say
    (Forgetting all laws of propriety,
  And that giving instruction, without introduction,
    Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),

  "As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,
    Since it lives in perpetual passion:
  Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--
    It is ages ahead of the fashion:

  "But it knows any friend it has met once before:
    It never will look at a bribe:
  And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,
    And collects--though it does not subscribe STOP "Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far
    Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:
  (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,
    And some, in mahogany kegs:)

  "You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:
    You condense it with locusts and tape:
  Still keeping one principal object in view--
    To preserve its symmetrical shape. STOP The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,
    But he felt that the Lesson must end,
  And he wept with delight in attempting to say
    He considered the Beaver his friend STOP While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks
    More eloquent even than tears,
  It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books
    Would have taught it in seventy years STOP They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned
    (For a moment) with noble emotion,
  Said "This amply repays all the wearisome days
    We have spent on the billowy ocean! STOP Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,
    Have seldom if ever been known;
  In winter or summer, 'twas always the same--
    You could never meet either alone STOP And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds
    Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour--
  The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,
    And cemented their friendship for ever STOP FIT VI.--THE BARRISTER'S DREAM STOP +Fit the Sixth.+

_THE BARRISTER'S DREAM._


  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
    They pursued it with forks and hope;
  They threatened its life with a railway-share;
    They charmed it with smiles and soap STOP But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain
    That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,
  Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain
    That his fancy had dwelt on so long STOP [Illustration]

  He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,
    Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,
  Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig
    On the charge of deserting its sty STOP The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,
    That the sty was deserted when found:
  And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law
    In a soft under-current of sound STOP The indictment had never been clearly expressed,
    And it seemed that the Snark had begun,
  And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed
    What the pig was supposed to have done STOP The Jury had each formed a different view
    (Long before the indictment was read),
  And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew
    One word that the others had said STOP "You must know--" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed "Fudge STOP That statute is obsolete quite STOP Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends
    On an ancient manorial right STOP "In the matter of Treason the pig would appear
    To have aided, but scarcely abetted:
  While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,
    If you grant the plea 'never indebted. STOP "The fact of Desertion I will not dispute:
    But its guilt, as I trust, is removed
  (So far as relates to the costs of this suit)
    By the Alibi which has been proved STOP "My poor client's fate now depends on your votes. STOP Here the speaker sat down in his place,
  And directed the Judge to refer to his notes
    And briefly to sum up the case STOP But the Judge said he never had summed up before;
    So the Snark undertook it instead,
  And summed it so well that it came to far more
    Than the Witnesses ever had said STOP When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,
    As the word was so puzzling to spell;
  But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind
    Undertaking that duty as well STOP So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,
    It was spent with the toils of the day:
  When it said the word "GUILTY! STOP the Jury all groaned,
    And some of them fainted away STOP Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite
    Too nervous to utter a word:
  When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,
    And the fall of a pin might be heard STOP "Transportation for life" was the sentence it gave,
    "And _then_ to be fined forty pound. STOP The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared
    That the phrase was not legally sound STOP But their wild exultation was suddenly checked
    When the jailer informed them, with tears,
  Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,
    As the pig had been dead for some years STOP The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:
    But the Snark, though a little aghast,
  As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,
    Went bellowing on to the last STOP Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed
    To grow every moment more clear:
  Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,
    Which the Bellman rang close at his ear STOP FIT VII.--THE BANKER'S FATE STOP +Fit the Seventh.+

_THE BANKER'S FATE._


  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
    They pursued it with forks and hope;
  They threatened its life with a railway-share;
    They charmed it with smiles and soap STOP And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new
    It was matter for general remark,
  Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view
    In his zeal to discover the Snark STOP But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,
    A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh
  And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,
    For he knew it was useless to fly STOP He offered large discount--he offered a cheque
    (Drawn "to bearer") for seven-pounds-ten:
  But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck
    And grabbed at the Banker again STOP Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws
    Went savagely snapping around--
  He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,
    Till fainting he fell to the ground STOP The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
    Led on by that fear-stricken yell:
  And the Bellman remarked "It is just as I feared! STOP And solemnly tolled on his bell STOP He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace
    The least likeness to what he had been:
  While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white--
    A wonderful thing to be seen STOP To the horror of all who were present that day STOP He uprose in full evening dress,
  And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say
    What his tongue could no longer express STOP [Illustration]

  Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his hair--
    And chanted in mimsiest tones
  Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,
    While he rattled a couple of bones STOP "Leave him here to his fate--it is getting so late! STOP The Bellman exclaimed in a fright STOP "We have lost half the day STOP Any further delay,
    And we sha'n't catch a Snark before night! STOP FIT VIII.--THE VANISHING STOP +Fit the Eighth.+

_THE VANISHING._


  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
    They pursued it with forks and hope;
  They threatened its life with a railway-share;
    They charmed it with smiles and soap STOP They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,
    And the Beaver, excited at last,
  Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,
    For the daylight was nearly past STOP "There is Thingumbob shouting! STOP the Bellman said STOP "He is shouting like mad, only hark STOP He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,
    He has certainly found a Snark! STOP They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed
    "He was always a desperate wag! STOP They beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed--
    On the top of a neighbouring crag,

  Erect and sublime, for one moment of time STOP In the next, that wild figure they saw
  (As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,
    While they waited and listened in awe STOP "It's a Snark! STOP was the sound that first came to their ears,
    And seemed almost too good to be true STOP Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:
    Then the ominous words "It's a Boo-"

  Then, silence STOP Some fancied they heard in the air
    A weary and wandering sigh
  That sounded like "-jum! STOP but the others declare
    It was only a breeze that went by STOP [Illustration]

  They hunted till darkness came on, but they found
    Not a button, or feather, or mark,
  By which they could tell that they stood on the ground
    Where the Baker had met with the Snark STOP In the midst of the word he was trying to say,
    In the midst of his laughter and glee,
  He had softly and suddenly vanished away--
    For the Snark _was_ a Boojum, you see STOP THE END STOP LONDON:

A Nursery Darling STOP A Mothers breast:
    Safe refuge from her childish fears,
    From childish troubles, childish tears,
    Mists that enshroud her dawning years STOP See how in sleep she seems to sing
    A voiceless psalm--an offering
    Raised, to the glory of her King,
          In Love: for Love is Rest STOP A Darlings kiss:
    Dearest of all the signs that fleet
    From lips that lovingly repeat
    Again, again, their message sweet STOP Full to the brim with girlish glee,
    A child, a very child is she,
    Whose dream of Heaven is still to be

I have reason to believe that Alices Adventures in Wonderland
has been read by some hundreds of English Children, aged from Five
to Fifteen: also by Children, aged from Fifteen to Twenty-five: yet
again by Children, aged from Twenty-five to Thirty-five: and even by
Children--for there _are_ such--Children in whom no waning of health
and strength, no weariness of the solemn mockery, and the gaudy
glitter, and the hopeless misery, of Life has availed to parch the pure
fountain of joy that wells up in all child-like hearts--Children of a
certain age, whose tale of years must be left untold, and buried in
respectful silence STOP And my ambition _now_ is (is it a vain one? STOP to be read by Children
aged from Nought to Five STOP To be read STOP Nay, not so STOP Say rather to be
thumbed, to be cooed over, to be dogs-eared, to be rumpled, to be
kissed, by the illiterate, ungrammatical, dimpled Darlings, that fill
your Nursery with merry uproar, and your inmost heart of hearts with a
restful gladness STOP Such, for instance, as a child I once knew, who--having been carefully
instructed that _one_ of any earthly thing was enough for any little
girl; and that to ask for _two_ buns, _two_ oranges, _two_ of anything,
would certainly bring upon her the awful charge of being greedy--was
found one morning sitting up in bed, solemnly regarding her _two_
little naked feet, and murmuring to herself, softly and penitently,

[Illustration]

I STOP THE WHITE RABBIT STOP Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Alice: and she had a
very curious dream STOP Would you like to hear what it was that she dreamed about STOP Well, this was the _first_ thing that happened STOP A White Rabbit came
running by, in a great hurry; and, just as it passed Alice, it stopped,
and took its watch out of its pocket STOP Wasnt _that_ a funny thing STOP Did _you_ ever see a Rabbit that had a
watch, and a pocket to put it in STOP Of course, when a Rabbit has a watch,
it _must_ have a pocket to put it in: it would never do to carry it
about in its mouth----and it wants its hands sometimes, to run about
with STOP Hasnt it got pretty pink eyes (I think _all_ White Rabbits have pink
eyes); and pink ears; and a nice brown coat; and you can just see its
red pocket-handkerchief peeping out of its coat-pocket: and, what with
its blue neck-tie and its yellow waistcoat, it really is _very_ nicely
dressed STOP Oh dear, oh dear STOP said the Rabbit STOP I shall be too late STOP _What_
would it be too late _for_, I wonder STOP Well, you see, it had to go and
visit the Duchess (youll see a picture of the Duchess, soon, sitting
in her kitchen): and the Duchess was a very cross old lady: and the
Rabbit _knew_ shed be very angry indeed if he kept her waiting STOP So the
poor thing was as frightened as frightened could be (Dont you see how
hes trembling STOP Just shake the book a little, from side to side, and
youll soon see him tremble), because he thought the Duchess would have
his head cut off, for a punishment STOP That was what the Queen of Hearts
used to do, when _she_ was angry with people (youll see a picture of
_her_, soon): at least she used to _order_ their heads to be cut off,
and she always _thought_ it was done, though they never _really_ did it STOP And so, when the White Rabbit ran away, Alice wanted to see what would
happen to it: so she ran after it: and she ran, and she ran, till she
tumbled right down the rabbit-hole STOP And then she had a very long fall indeed STOP Down, and down, and down,
till she began to wonder if she was going right _through_ the World, so
as to come out on the other side STOP It was just like a very deep well: only there was no water in it STOP If
anybody _really_ had such a fall as that, it would kill them, most
likely: but you know it doesnt hurt a bit to fall in a _dream_,
because, all the time you _think_ youre falling, you really _are_
lying somewhere, safe and sound, and fast asleep STOP However, this terrible fall came to an end at last, and down came Alice
on a heap of sticks and dry leaves STOP But she wasnt a bit hurt, and up
she jumped, and ran after the Rabbit again STOP And so that was the beginning of Alices curious dream STOP And, next time
you see a White Rabbit, try and fancy _youre_ going to have a curious
dream, just like dear little Alice STOP [Illustration]

II STOP HOW ALICE GREW TALL STOP And so, after Alice had tumbled down the rabbit-hole, and had run a
long long way underground, all of a sudden she found herself in a great
hall, with doors all round it STOP But all the doors were locked: so, you see, poor Alice couldnt get out
of the hall: and that made her very sad STOP However, after a little while, she came to a little table, all made of
glass, with three legs (There are _two_ of the legs in the picture, and
just the _beginning_ of the other leg, do you see STOP ), and on the table
was a little key: and she went round the hall, and tried if she could
unlock any of the doors with it STOP Poor Alice STOP The key wouldnt unlock _any_ of the doors STOP But at last she
came upon a tiny little door: and oh, how glad she was, when she found
the key would fit it STOP So she unlocked the tiny little door, and she stooped down and looked
through it, and what do you think she saw STOP Oh, such a beautiful garden STOP And she did so _long_ to go into it STOP But the door was _far_ too small STOP She couldnt squeeze herself through, any more than _you_ could squeeze
yourself into a mouse-hole STOP So poor little Alice locked up the door, and took the key back to the
table again: and _this_ time she found quite a new thing on it (now
look at the picture again), and what do you think it was STOP It was a
little bottle, with a label tied to it, with the words DRINK ME on
the label STOP So she tasted it: and it was _very_ nice: so she set to work, and drank
it up STOP And then _such_ a curious thing happened to her STOP Youll never
guess what it was: so I shall have to tell you STOP She got smaller, and
smaller, till at last she was just the size of a little doll STOP Then she said to herself _Now_ Im the right size to get through the
little door STOP And away she ran STOP But, when she got there, the door was
locked, and the key was on the top of the table, and she couldnt reach
it STOP _Wasnt_ it a pity she had locked up the door again STOP Well, the next thing she found was a little cake: and it had the words
EAT ME marked on it STOP So of course she set to work and ate it up STOP And
_then_ what do you think happened to her STOP No, youll never guess STOP I
shall have to tell you again STOP She grew, and she grew, and she grew STOP Taller than she was before STOP Taller than _any_ child STOP Taller than any grown-up person STOP Taller, and
taller, and taller STOP Just look at the picture, and youll _see_ how tall
she got STOP [Illustration]

Which would _you_ have liked the best, do you think, to be a little
tiny Alice, no larger than a kitten, or a great tall Alice, with your
head always knocking against the ceiling STOP III STOP THE POOL OF TEARS STOP Perhaps you think Alice must have been very much pleased, when she had
eaten the little cake, to find herself growing so tremendously tall STOP Because of course it would be easy enough, _now_, to reach the little
key off the glass table, and to open the little tiny door STOP Well, of course she could do _that_: but what good was it to get the
door open, when she couldnt get _through_ STOP She was worse off than
ever, poor thing STOP She could just manage, by putting her head down,
close to the ground, to _look_ through with one eye STOP But that was _all_
she could do STOP No wonder the poor tall child sat down and cried as if
her heart would break STOP So she cried, and she cried STOP And her tears ran down the middle of the
hall, like a deep river STOP And very soon there was quite a large Pool of
Tears, reaching half-way down the hall STOP And there she might have staid, till this very day, if the White
Rabbit hadnt happened to come through the hall, on his way to visit
the Duchess STOP He was dressed up as grand as grand could be, and he
had a pair of white kid gloves in one hand, and a little fan in the
other hand: and he kept on muttering to himself Oh, the Duchess, the
Duchess STOP Oh, _wont_ she be savage if Ive kept her waiting STOP But he didnt see Alice, you know STOP So, when she began to say If
you please, Sir---- her voice seemed to come from the top of the
hall, because her head was so high up STOP And the Rabbit was dreadfully
frightened: and he dropped the gloves and the fan, and ran away as hard
as he could go STOP Then a _very_ curious thing indeed happened STOP Alice took up the fan, and
began to fan herself with it: and, lo and behold, she got quite small
again, and, all in a minute, she was just about the size of a mouse STOP [Illustration]

Now look at the picture, and youll soon guess what happened next STOP It
looks just like the sea, doesnt it STOP But it _really_ is the Pool of
Tears----all made of _Alices_ tears, you know STOP And Alice has tumbled into the Pool: and the Mouse has tumbled in: and
there they are, swimming about together STOP Doesnt Alice look pretty, as she swims across the picture STOP You can
just see her blue stockings, far away under the water STOP But why is the Mouse swimming away from Alice in such a hurry STOP Well,
the reason is, that Alice began talking about cats and dogs: and a
Mouse always _hates_ talking about cats and dogs STOP Suppose _you_ were swimming about, in a Pool of your own Tears: and
suppose somebody began talking to _you_ about lesson-books and bottles
of medicine, wouldnt _you_ swim away as hard as you could go STOP IV STOP THE CAUCUS-RACE STOP When Alice and the Mouse had got out of the Pool of Tears, of course
they were very wet: and so were a lot of other curious creatures, that
had tumbled in as well STOP There was a Dodo (thats the great bird, in
front, leaning on a walking-stick); and a Duck; and a Lory (thats just
behind the Duck, looking over its head); and an Eaglet (thats on the
left-hand side of the Lory); and several others STOP Well, and so they didnt know how in the world they were to get dry
again STOP But the Dodo----who was a very wise bird----told them the right
way was to have a Caucus-Race STOP And what do you think _that_ was STOP _You dont know?_ Well, you _are_ an ignorant child STOP Now, be very
attentive, and Ill soon cure you of your ignorance STOP First, you must have a _racecourse_ STOP It ought to be a _sort_ of circle,
but it doesnt much matter _what_ shape it is, so long as it goes a
good way round, and joins on to itself again STOP Then, you must put all the _racers_ on the course, here and there:
it doesnt matter _where_, so long as you dont crowd them too much
together STOP Then, you neednt say One, two, three, and away STOP but let them all set
off running just when they like, and leave off just when they like STOP So all these creatures, Alice and all, went on running round and round,
till they were all quite dry again STOP And then the Dodo said _everybody_
had won, and _everybody_ must have prizes STOP Of course _Alice_ had to give them their prizes STOP And she had nothing
to give them but a few comfits she happened to have in her pocket STOP And
there was just one a-piece, all round STOP And there was no prize for Alice STOP So what do you think they did STOP Alice had nothing left but her thimble STOP Now look at the picture, and youll see what happened STOP [Illustration]

Hand it over here STOP said the Dodo STOP Then the Dodo took the thimble and handed it back to Alice, and said
We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble STOP And then all the
other creatures cheered STOP Wasnt _that_ a curious sort of present to give her STOP Suppose they
wanted to give _you_ a birthday-present, would you rather they should
go to your toy-cupboard, and pick out your nicest doll, and say Here,
my love, heres a lovely birthday-present for you STOP or would you like
them to give you something _new_, something that _didnt_ belong to you
before STOP V.

BILL, THE LIZARD STOP Now Im going to tell you about Alices Adventures in the White
Rabbits house STOP Do you remember how the Rabbit dropped his gloves and his fan, when
he was so frightened at hearing Alices voice, that seemed to come
down from the sky STOP Well, of course he couldnt go to visit the Duchess
_without_ his gloves and his fan: so, after a bit, he came back again
to look for them STOP By this time the Dodo and all the other curious creatures had gone
away, and Alice was wandering about all alone STOP So what do you think he did STOP Actually he thought she was his housemaid,
and began ordering her about STOP Mary Ann STOP he said STOP Go home this very
minute, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan STOP Quick, now STOP Perhaps he couldnt see very clearly with his pink eyes: for Im sure
Alice doesnt look very _like_ a housemaid, _does_ she STOP However she was
a very good-natured little girl: so she wasnt a bit offended, but ran
off to the Rabbits house as quick as she could STOP It was lucky she found the door open: for, if she had had to ring, I
suppose the _real_ Mary Ann would have come to open the door: and she
would _never_ have let Alice come in STOP And Im sure it was _very_ lucky
she didnt meet the real Mary Ann, as she trotted upstairs: for Im
afraid she would have taken Alice for a robber STOP So at last she found her way into the Rabbits room: and there was a
pair of gloves lying on the table, and she was just going to take them
up and go away, when she happened to see a little bottle on the table STOP And of course it had the words DRINK ME STOP on the label STOP And of course
Alice drank some STOP Well, I think that was _rather_ lucky, too: dont _you_ STOP For, if she
_hadnt_ drunk any, all this wonderful adventure, that Im going to
tell you about, wouldnt have happened at all STOP And wouldnt _that_ have
been a pity STOP Youre getting so used to Alices Adventures, that I daresay you can
guess what happened next STOP If you cant, Ill tell you STOP She grew, and she grew, and she grew STOP And in a very short time the room
was full of _Alice_: just in the same way as a jar is full of jam STOP There was _Alice_ all the way up to the ceiling: and _Alice_ in every
corner of the room STOP [Illustration]

The door opened inwards: so of course there wasnt any room to open it:
so when the Rabbit got tired of waiting, and came to fetch his gloves
for himself, of course he couldnt get in STOP So what do you think he did STOP (Now we come to the picture) STOP He sent
Bill, the Lizard, up to the roof of the house, and told him to get
down the chimney STOP But Alice happened to have one of her feet in the
fire-place: so, when she heard Bill coming down the chimney, she just
gave a little tiny kick, and away went Bill, flying up into the sky STOP Poor little Bill STOP Dont you pity him very much STOP How frightened he must
have been STOP VI STOP THE DEAR LITTLE PUPPY STOP Well, it doesnt look such a very _little_ Puppy, does it STOP But then,
you see, Alice had grown very small indeed: and _thats_ what makes
the Puppy look so large STOP When Alice had eaten one of those little
magic cakes, that she found in the White Rabbits house, it made her
get quite small, directly, so that she could get through the door: or
else she could _never_ have got out of the house again STOP Wouldnt _that_
have been a pity STOP Because then she wouldnt have dreamed all the other
curious things that were going to read about STOP So it really _was_ a _little_ Puppy, you see STOP And isnt it a little
_pet_ STOP And look at the way its barking at the little stick that Alice
is holding out for it STOP You can see she was a _little_ afraid of it,
all the time, because shes got behind that great thistle, for fear it
should run over her STOP That would have been just about as bad, for _her_,
as it would be for _you_ to be run over by a waggon and four horses STOP Have you got a little pet puppy at _your_ home STOP If you have, I hope
youre always kind to it, and give it nice things to eat STOP Once upon a time, I knew some little children, about as big as you; and
they had a little pet dog of their own; and it was called _Dash_ STOP And
this is what they told me about its birthday-treat STOP Do you know, one day we remembered it was Dashs birthday that day STOP So
we said Lets give Dash a nice birthday-treat, like what we have on
_our_ birthdays STOP So we thought and we thought Now, what is it _we_
like best of all, on _our_ birthdays STOP And we thought and we thought STOP And at last we all called out together Why, its _oatmeal-porridge_, of
course STOP So of course we thought Dash would be _quite_ sure to like it
very much, too STOP [Illustration]

So we went to the cook, and we got her to make a saucerful of nice
oatmeal-porridge STOP And then we called Dash into the house, and we said
Now, Dash, youre going to have your birthday-treat STOP We expected Dash
would jump for joy: but it didnt, one bit STOP So we put the saucer down before it, and we said Now, Dash, dont be
greedy STOP Eat it nicely, like a good dog STOP So Dash just tasted it with the tip of its tongue: and then it made,
oh, such a horrid face STOP And then, do you know, it did _hate_ it so, it
wouldnt eat a bit more of it STOP So we had to put it all down its throat
with a spoon STOP I wonder if Alice will give _this_ little Puppy some porridge STOP I dont
think she _can_, because she hasnt got any with her STOP I cant see any
saucer in the picture STOP VII STOP THE BLUE CATERPILLAR STOP Would you like to know what happened to Alice, after she had got away
from the Puppy STOP It was far too large an animal, you know, for _her_ to
play with STOP (I dont suppose _you_ would much enjoy playing with a young
Hippopotamus, would you STOP You would always be expecting to be crushed as
flat as a pancake under its great heavy feet! STOP So Alice was very glad
to run away, while it wasnt looking STOP Well, she wandered up and down, and didnt know what in the world to
do, to make herself grow up to her right size again STOP Of course she knew
that she had to eat or drink _something_: that was the regular rule,
you know: but she couldnt guess _what_ thing STOP [Illustration]

However, she soon came to a great mushroom, that was so tall that she
couldnt see over the top of it without standing on tip-toe STOP And what
do you think she saw STOP Something that Im sure _you_ never talked to, in
all your life STOP It was a large Blue Caterpillar STOP Ill tell you, soon, what Alice and the Caterpillar talked about: but
first let us have a good look at the picture STOP That curious thing, standing in front of the Caterpillar, is called a
hookah: and its used for smoking STOP The smoke comes through that long
tube, that winds round and round like a serpent STOP And do you see its long nose and chin STOP At least, they _look_ exactly
like a nose and chin, dont they STOP But they really _are_ two of its
legs STOP You know a Caterpillar has got _quantities_ of legs: you can see
some more of them, further down STOP What a bother it must be to a Caterpillar, counting over such a lot of
legs, every night, to make sure it hasnt lost any of them STOP And _another_ great bother must be, having to settle _which_ leg it had
better move first STOP I think, if _you_ had forty or fifty legs, and if
you wanted to go a walk, youd be such a time in settling which leg to
begin with, that youd never go a walk at all STOP And what did Alice and the Caterpillar _talk_ about, I wonder STOP Well, Alice told it how _very_ confusing it was, being first one size
and then another STOP And the Caterpillar asked her if she liked the size she was, just then STOP And Alice said she would like to be just a _little_ bit larger----three
inches was such a _wretched_ height to be STOP (Just mark off three inches
on the wall, about the length of your middle finger, and youll see
what size she was. STOP And the Caterpillar told her one side of the mushroom would make her
grow _taller_, and the other side would make her grow _shorter_ STOP So Alice took two little bits of it with her to nibble, and managed to
make herself quite a nice comfortable height, before she went on to
visit the Duchess STOP [Illustration]

VIII STOP THE PIG-BABY STOP Would you like to hear about Alices visit to the Duchess STOP It was a
very interesting visit indeed, I can assure you STOP Of course she knocked at the door to begin with: but nobody came: so
she had to open it for herself STOP Now, if you look at the picture, youll see exactly what Alice saw when
she got inside STOP The door led right into the kitchen, you see STOP The Duchess sat in the
middle of the room, nursing the Baby STOP The Baby was howling STOP The soup
was boiling STOP The Cook was stirring the soup STOP The Cat----it was a
_Cheshire_ Cat----was grinning, as Cheshire Cats always do STOP All these
things were happening just as Alice went in STOP The Duchess has a beautiful cap and gown, hasnt she STOP But Im afraid
she _hasnt_ got a very beautiful _face_ STOP The Baby----well, I daresay youve seen _several_ nicer babies than
_that_: and more good-tempered ones, too STOP However, take a good look at
it, and well see if you know it again, next time you meet it STOP The Cook----well, you _may_ have seen nicer cooks, once or twice STOP But Im nearly sure youve _never_ seen a nicer _Cat_ STOP Now _have_ you STOP And _wouldnt_ you like to have a Cat of your own, just like that one,
with lovely green eyes, and smiling so sweetly STOP The Duchess was very rude to Alice STOP And no wonder STOP Why, she even called
her own _Baby_ Pig STOP And it _wasnt_ a Pig, _was_ it STOP And she ordered
the Cook to chop off Alices head: though of course the Cook didnt do
it: and at last she threw the Baby at her STOP So Alice caught the Baby,
and took it away with her: and I think that was about the best thing
she could do STOP So she wandered away, through the wood, carrying the ugly little thing
with her STOP And a great job it was to keep hold of it, it wriggled about
so STOP But at last she found out that the _proper_ way was, to keep tight
hold of its left foot and its right ear STOP But dont _you_ try to hold on to a Baby like that, my Child STOP There are
not many babies that _like_ being nursed in _that_ way STOP Well, and so the Baby kept grunting, and grunting so that Alice had to
say to it, quite seriously, If youre going to turn into a _Pig_, my
dear, Ill have nothing more to do with you STOP Mind now STOP And at last she looked down into its face, and what _do_ you think had
happened to it STOP Look at the picture, and see if you can guess STOP [Illustration]

Why, _thats_ not the Baby that Alice was nursing, is it STOP Ah, I _knew_ you wouldnt know it again, though I told you to take a
good look at it STOP Yes, it _is_ the Baby STOP And its turned into a little
_Pig_ STOP So Alice put it down, and let it trot away into the wood STOP And she said
to herself It was a _very_ ugly _Baby_: but it makes rather a handsome
_Pig_, I think STOP Dont you think she was right STOP IX STOP THE CHESHIRE-CAT STOP All alone, all alone STOP Poor Alice STOP No Baby, not even a _Pig_ to keep her
company STOP So you may be sure she was very glad indeed, when she saw the
Cheshire-Cat, perched up in a tree, over her head STOP The Cat has a very nice smile, no doubt: but just look what a lot of
teeth its got STOP Isnt Alice just a _little_ shy of it STOP Well, yes, a _little_ STOP But then, it couldnt help having teeth, you
know: and it _could_ have helped smiling, supposing it had been cross STOP So, on the whole, she was _glad_ STOP Doesnt Alice look very prim, holding her head so straight up, and with
her hands behind her, just as if she were going to say her lessons to
the Cat STOP [Illustration]

And that reminds me STOP Theres a little lesson I want to teach _you_,
while were looking at this picture of Alice and the Cat STOP Now dont be
in a bad temper about it, my dear Child STOP Its a very _little_ lesson
indeed STOP Do you see that Fox-Glove growing close to the tree STOP And do you know
why its called a _Fox_-Glove STOP Perhaps you think its got something to
do with a Fox STOP No indeed STOP _Foxes_ never wear Gloves STOP The right word is _Folks_-Gloves STOP Did you ever hear that Fairies
used to be called the good _Folk_ STOP Now weve finished the lesson, and well wait a minute, till youve got
your temper again STOP Well STOP Do you feel quite good-natured again STOP No temper-ache STOP No
crossness about the corners of the mouth STOP Then well go on STOP Cheshire Puss STOP said Alice STOP (_Wasnt_ that a pretty name for a Cat? STOP Would you tell me which way I ought to go from here STOP And so the Cheshire-Cat told her which way she ought to go, if she
wanted to visit the Hatter, and which way to go, to visit the March
Hare STOP Theyre both mad STOP said the Cat STOP And then the Cat vanished away, just like the flame of a candle when it
goes out STOP So Alice set off, to visit the March Hare STOP And as she went along, there
was the Cat again STOP And she told it she didnt _like_ it coming and
going so quickly STOP [Illustration]

So this time the Cat vanished quite slowly, beginning with the tail,
and ending with the grin STOP Wasnt _that_ a curious thing, a Grin without
any Cat STOP Would you like to see one STOP If you turn up the corner of this leaf, youll have Alice looking at
the Grin: and she doesnt look a bit more frightened than when she was
looking at the Cat, _does_ she STOP X STOP THE MAD TEA-PARTY STOP This is the Mad Tea-Party STOP You see Alice had left the Cheshire-Cat, and
had gone off to see the March Hare and the Hatter, as the Cheshire-Cat
had advised her: and she found them having tea under a great tree, with
a Dormouse sitting between them STOP There were only those three at the table, but there were quantities of
tea-cups set all along it STOP You cant see all the table, you know, and
even in the bit you _can_ see there are nine cups, counting the one the
March Hare has got in his hand STOP Thats the March Hare, with the long ears, and straws mixed up with his
hair STOP The straws showed he was mad----I dont know why STOP Never twist up
straws among _your_ hair, for fear people should think youre mad STOP There was a nice green arm-chair at the end of the table, that looked
as if it was just meant for Alice: so she went and sat down in it STOP Then she had quite a long talk with the March Hare and the Hatter STOP The
Dormouse didnt say much STOP You see it was fast asleep generally, and it
only just woke up for a moment, now and then STOP As long as it was asleep, it was very useful to the March Hare and the
Hatter, because it had a nice round soft head, just like a pillow: so
they could put their elbows on it, and lean across it, and talk to
each other quite comfortably STOP You wouldnt like people to use _your_
head for a pillow, _would_ you STOP But if you were fast asleep, like the
Dormouse, you wouldnt feel it: so I suppose you wouldnt care about it STOP [Illustration]

Im afraid they gave Alice _very_ little to eat and drink STOP However,
after a bit, she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter: only
I dont quite see where she _got_ the bread-and-butter: and she had no
plate for it STOP Nobody seems to have a plate except the Hatter STOP I believe
the March Hare must have had one as well: because, when they all moved
one place on (that was the rule at this curious tea-party), and Alice
had to go into the place of the March Hare, she found he had just upset
the milk-jug into his plate STOP So I suppose his plate and the milk-jug
are hidden behind that large tea-pot STOP The Hatter used to carry about hats to sell: and even the one that hes
got on his head is meant to be sold STOP You see its got its price marked
on it----a 10 and a 6----that means ten shillings and sixpence STOP Wasnt that a funny way of selling hats STOP And hasnt he got a beautiful
neck-tie on STOP Such a lovely yellow tie, with large red spots STOP He has just got up to say to Alice Your hair wants cutting STOP That was
a rude thing to say, _wasnt_ it STOP And do you think her hair _does_ want
cutting STOP _I_ think its a very pretty length----just the right length STOP XI STOP THE QUEENS GARDEN STOP This is a little bit of the beautiful garden I told you about STOP You see
Alice had managed at last to get quite small, so that she could go
through the little door STOP I suppose she was about as tall as a mouse,
if it stood on its hind-legs: so of course this was a _very_ tiny
rose-tree: and these are _very_ tiny gardeners STOP [Illustration]

What funny little men they are STOP But _are_ they men, do you think STOP I
think they must be live cards, with just a head, and arms, and legs, so
as to _look_ like little men STOP And what _are_ they doing with that red
paint, I wonder STOP Well, you see, this is what they told Alice The Queen
of Hearts wanted to have a _red_ rose-tree just in that corner: and
these poor little gardeners had made a great mistake, and had put in a
_white_ one instead: and they were so frightened about it, because the
Queen was _sure_ to be angry, and then she would order all their heads
to be cut off STOP She was a dreadfully savage Queen, and that was the way she always did,
when she was angry with people STOP Off with their heads STOP They didnt
_really_ cut their heads off, you know: because nobody ever obeyed her:
but that was what she always _said_ STOP _Now_ cant you guess what the poor little gardeners are trying to
do STOP Theyre trying to paint the roses _red_, and theyre in a great
hurry to get it done before the Queen comes STOP And then _perhaps_ the
Queen wont find out it was a _white_ rose-tree to begin with: and then
_perhaps_ the little men wont get their heads cut off STOP You see there were _five_ large white roses on the tree----such a job
to get them all painted red STOP But theyve got three and a half done,
now, and if only they wouldnt stop to talk----work away, little men,
_do_ work away STOP Or the Queen will be coming before its done STOP And if
she finds any _white_ roses on the tree, do you know what will happen STOP It will be Off with their heads STOP Oh, work away, my little men STOP Hurry,
hurry STOP [Illustration]

_The Queen has come!_ And _isnt_ she angry STOP Oh, my poor little Alice STOP XII STOP THE LOBSTER-QUADRILLE STOP Did you ever play at Croquet STOP There are large wooden balls, painted
with different colours, that you have to roll about; and arches of
wire, that you have to send them through; and great wooden mallets,
with long handles, to knock the balls about with STOP Now look at the picture, and youll see that _Alice_ has just been
playing a Game of Croquet STOP But she _couldnt_ play, with that great red whats-its-name in her
arms STOP Why, how could she hold the mallet STOP [Illustration]

Why, my dear Child, that great red whats-its-name (its _real_ name is
_a Flamingo_) _is_ the mallet STOP In this Croquet-Game, the balls were
live _Hedge-hogs_----you know a hedge-hog can roll itself up into a
ball?----and the mallets were live _Flamingos_ STOP So Alice is just resting from the Game, for a minute, to have a chat
with that dear old thing, the Duchess: and of course she keeps her
mallet under her arm, so as not to lose it STOP But I dont think she _was_ a dear old thing, one bit STOP To call her
Baby a _Pig_, and to want to chop off Alices head STOP Oh, that was only a joke, about chopping off Alices head: and as
to the Baby----why, it _was_ a Pig, you know STOP And just look at her
_smile_ STOP Why, its wider than all Alices head: and yet you can only
see half of it STOP Well, theyd only had a _very_ little chat, when the Queen came and
took Alice away, to see the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle STOP _You dont know what a Gryphon is?_ Well STOP Do you know _anything_ STOP Thats the question STOP However, look at the picture STOP That creature with
a red head, and red claws, and green scales, is the _Gryphon_ STOP Now you
know STOP And the others the _Mock Turtle_ STOP Its got a calfs-head, because
calfs head is used to make _Mock Turtle Soup_ STOP Now you know STOP But what are they _doing_, going round and round Alice like that STOP Why, I thought of _course_ youd know _that_ STOP Theyre dancing _a
Lobster-Quadrille_ STOP [Illustration]

And next time _you_ meet a Gryphon and a Mock Turtle, I daresay theyll
dance it for _you_, if you ask them prettily STOP Only dont let them come
_quite_ close, or theyll be treading on your toes, as they did on poor
Alices STOP XIII STOP WHO STOLE THE TARTS STOP Did you ever hear how the Queen of Hearts made some tarts STOP And can you
tell me what became of them STOP Why, of _course_ I can STOP Doesnt the song tell all about it STOP _The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts:
        All on a summer day:
    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
        And took them quite away!_

Well, yes, the _Song_ says so STOP But it would never do to punish the poor
Knave, just because there was a _Song_ about him STOP They had to take him
prisoner, and put chains on his wrists, and bring him before the King
of Hearts, so that there might be a regular trial STOP Now, if you look at the big picture, at the beginning of this book,
youll see what a grand thing a trial is, when the Judge is a King STOP The King is very grand, _isnt_ he STOP But he doesnt look very _happy_ STOP I
think that big crown, on the top of his wig, must be _very_ heavy and
uncomfortable STOP But he had to wear them _both_, you see, so that people
might know he was a Judge _and_ a King STOP And _doesnt_ the Queen look cross STOP She can see the dish of tarts on
the table, that she had taken such trouble to make STOP And she can see the
bad Knave (do you see the chains hanging from his wrists? STOP that stole
them away from her: so I dont think its any wonder if she _does_ feel
a _little_ cross STOP The White Rabbit is standing near the King, reading out the Song, to
tell everybody what a bad Knave he is: and the Jury (you can just see
two of them, up in the Jury-box, the Frog and the Duck) have to settle
whether hes guilty or not guilty STOP Now Ill tell you about the accident that happened to Alice STOP You see, she was sitting close by the Jury-box: and she was called as
a witness STOP You know what a witness is STOP A witness is a person who
has seen the prisoner do whatever hes accused of, or at any rate knows
_something_ thats important in the trial STOP But _Alice_ hadnt seen the Queen _make_ the tarts: and she hadnt seen
the Knave _take_ the tarts: and, in fact, she didnt know anything
about it: so why in the world they wanted _her_ to be a witness, Im
sure _I_ cant tell you STOP Anyhow, they _did_ want her STOP And the White Rabbit blew his big trumpet,
and shouted out Alice STOP And so Alice jumped up in a great hurry STOP And
then----

And then what _do_ you think happened STOP Why, her skirt caught against
the Jury-box, and tipped it over, and all the poor little Jurors came
tumbling out of it STOP [Illustration]

Lets try if we can make out all the twelve STOP You know there ought
to be twelve to make up a Jury STOP I see the Frog, and the Dormouse,
and the Rat and the Ferret, and the Hedgehog, and the Lizard, and
the Bantam-Cock, and the Mole, and the Duck, and the Squirrel, and a
screaming bird, with a long beak, just behind the Mole STOP But that only makes eleven: we must find one more creature STOP Oh, do you see a little white head, coming out behind the Mole, and
just under the Ducks beak STOP That makes up the twelve STOP Mr. Tenniel says the screaming bird is a _Storkling_ (of course you
know what _that_ is? STOP and the little white head is a _Mouseling_ STOP Isnt
it a little _darling_ STOP Alice picked them all up again, very carefully, and I hope they werent
_much_ hurt STOP XIV STOP THE SHOWER OF CARDS STOP Oh dear, oh dear STOP What _is_ it all about STOP And whats happening to Alice STOP Well, Ill tell you all about it, as well I can STOP The way the trial
ended was this STOP The King wanted the Jury to settle whether the Knave
of Hearts was _guilty_ or _not guilty_----that means that they were to
settle whether _he_ had stolen the Tarts, or if somebody else had taken
them STOP But the wicked _Queen_ wanted to have his _punishment_ settled,
first of all STOP That wasnt at all fair, _was_ it STOP Because, you know,
supposing he never _took_ the Tarts, then of course he oughtnt to be
punished STOP Would _you_ like to be punished for something you hadnt
done STOP [Illustration]

So Alice said Stuff and nonsense STOP So the Queen said Off with her head STOP (Just what she always said, when
she was angry. STOP So Alice said Who cares for _you_ STOP Youre nothing but a pack of cards STOP So they were _all_ very angry, and flew up into the air, and came
tumbling down again, all over Alice, just like a shower of rain STOP And I think youll _never_ guess what happened next STOP The next thing
was, Alice woke up out of her curious dream STOP And she found that the
cards were only some leaves off the tree, that the wind had blown down
upon her face STOP _Wouldnt_ it be a nice thing to have a curious dream, just like Alice STOP The best plan is this STOP First lie down under a tree, and wait till a
White Rabbit runs by, with a watch in his hand: then shut your eyes,
and pretend to be dear little Alice STOP Good-bye, Alice dear, good-bye STOP THE END STOP AN EASTER GREETING

TO

EVERY CHILD WHO LOVES ALICE STOP My dear Child,

_Please to fancy, if you can, that you are reading a real letter, from
a real friend whom you have seen, and whose voice you can seem to
yourself to hear, wishing you, as I do now with all my heart, a happy
Easter._

_Do you know that delicious dreamy feeling, when one first wakes on a
summer morning, with the twitter of birds in the air, and the fresh
breeze coming in at the open window----when, lying lazily with eyes
half shut, one sees as in a dream green boughs waving, or waters
rippling in a golden light STOP It is a pleasure very near to sadness,
bringing tears to ones eyes like a beautiful picture or poem STOP And
is not that a Mothers gentle hand that undraws your curtains, and a
Mothers sweet voice that summons you to rise STOP To rise and forget, in
the bright sunlight, the ugly dreams that frightened you so when all
was dark----to rise and enjoy another happy day, first kneeling to
thank that unseen Friend who sends you the beautiful sun?_

_Are these strange words from a writer of such tales as Alice STOP And is
this a strange letter to find in a book of nonsense STOP It may be so STOP Some
perhaps may blame me for thus mixing together things grave and gay;
others may smile and think it odd that any one should speak of solemn
things at all, except in Church and on a Sunday: but I think----nay, I
am sure----that some children will read this gently and lovingly, and
in the spirit in which I have written it._

_For I do not believe God means us thus to divide life into two
halves----to wear a grave face on Sunday, and to think it out-of-place
to even so much as mention Him on a week-day STOP Do you think He cares to
see only kneeling figures and to hear only tones of prayer----and that
He does not also love to see the lambs leaping in the sunlight, and
to hear the merry voices of the children, as they roll among the hay STOP Surely their innocent laughter is as sweet in His ears as the grandest
anthem that ever rolled up from the dim religious light of some
solemn cathedral?_

_And if I have written anything to add to those stores of innocent and
healthy amusement that are laid up in books for the children I love so
well, it is surely something I may hope to look back upon without shame
and sorrow (as how much of life must then be recalled! STOP when my turn
comes to walk through the valley of shadows._

_This Easter sun will rise on you, dear child, feeling your life in
every limb, and eager to rush out into the fresh morning air----and
many an Easter-day will come and go, before it finds you feeble
and grey-headed, creeping wearily out to bask once more in the
sunlight----but it is good, even now, to think sometimes of that great
morning when the Sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in
his wings._

_Surely your gladness need not be the less for the thought that you
will one day see a brighter dawn than this----when lovelier sights
will meet your eyes than any waving trees or rippling waters----when
angel-hands shall undraw your curtains, and sweeter tones than ever
loving Mother breathed shall wake you to a new and glorious day----and
when all the sadness, and the sin, that darkened life on this little
earth, shall be forgotten like the dreams of a night that is past!_

    _Your affectionate Friend_,

      _LEWIS CARROLL_ STOP CHRISTMAS GREETINGS STOP (_FROM A FAIRY TO A CHILD._)


    Lady dear, if Fairies may
      For a moment lay aside
    Cunning tricks and elfish play,
      Tis at happy Christmas-tide STOP We have heard the children say--
      Gentle children, whom we love--
    Long ago, on Christmas Day,
      Came a message from above STOP Still, as Christmas-tide comes round,
      They remember it again--
    Echo still the joyful sound
      Peace on earth, good-will to men STOP Yet the hearts must childlike be
      Where such heavenly guests abide:
    Unto children, in their glee,
      All the year is Christmas-tide STOP Thus, forgetting tricks and play
      For a moment, Lady dear,
    We would wish you, if we may,
      Merry Christmas, glad New Year STOP _LEWIS CARROLL_

CAUTIONS TO READERS STOP On August 1st, 1881, a story appeared in _Aunt Judys Magazine_ No STOP 184, entitled The Land of Idleness, by LEWIS CARROLL STOP This story was
really written by a lady, FRAULEIN IDA LACKOWITZ STOP Acting on her behalf,
Mr. CARROLL forwarded it to the Editor: and this led to the mistake of
naming him as its author STOP In October, 1887, the writer of an article on Literature for the
Little ones, in _The Nineteenth Century_, stated that, in 1864, TOM
HOOD was delighting the world with such works as _From Nowhere to the
North Pole_ STOP Between TOM HOOD and Mr. LEWIS CARROLL there is more than
a suspicion of resemblance in some particulars STOP _Alices Adventures
in Wonderland_ narrowly escapes challenging a comparison with _From
Nowhere to the North Pole_ STOP The idea of both is so similar that Mr.
CARROLL can hardly have been surprised if some people have believed he
was inspired by HOOD STOP The date 1864 is a mistake STOP _From Nowhere to the
North Pole_ was first published in 1874 STOP End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Nursery Alice, by Lewis Carroll

  RICHARD CLAY AND SONS, LIMITED,
  LONDON AND BUNGAY STOP PREFACE STOP Nearly the whole of this volume is a reprint of the serious portion of
_Phantasmagoria and other Poems_, which was first published in 1869 and
has long been out of print STOP "The Path of Roses" was written soon after the
Crimean War, when the name of Florence Nightingale had already become a
household-word STOP "Only a Woman's Hair" was suggested by a circumstance
mentioned in _The Life of Dean Swift_, viz., that, after his death, a
small packet was found among his papers, containing a single lock of hair
and inscribed with those words STOP "After Three Days" was written after
seeing Holman Hunt's picture, _The Finding of Christ in the Temple_ STOP The two poems, "Far Away" and "A Song of Love", are reprinted from _Sylvie
and Bruno_ and _Sylvie and Bruno Concluded_, books whose high price (made
necessary by the great cost of production) has, I fear, put them out of
the reach of most of my readers STOP "A Lesson in Latin" is reprinted from
_The Jabberwock_, a Magazine got up among the Members of "The Girls' Latin
School, Boston, U.S.A." The only poems, here printed for the first time,
are put together under the title of "Puck Lost and Found," having been
inscribed in two books--_Fairies_, a poem by Allingham, illustrated by
Miss E. Gertrude Thomson, and _Merry Elves_, a story-book, by whom written
I do not know, illustrated by C. O. Murray--which were presented to a
little girl and boy, as a sort of memento of a visit paid by them to the
author one day, on which occasion he taught them the pastime--dear to the
hearts of children--of folding paper-"pistols," which can be made to
imitate, fairly well, the noise of a real one STOP _Jan., 1898._

THREE SUNSETS STOP He saw her once, and in the glance,
    A moment's glance of meeting eyes,
  His heart stood still in sudden trance:
    He trembled with a sweet surprise--
  All in the waning light she stood,
  The star of perfect womanhood STOP That summer-eve his heart was light:
    With lighter step he trod the ground:
  And life was fairer in his sight,
    And music was in every sound:
  He blessed the world where there could be
  So beautiful a thing as she STOP There once again, as evening fell
    And stars were peering overhead,
  Two lovers met to bid farewell:
    The western sun gleamed faint and red,
  Lost in a drift of purple cloud
  That wrapped him like a funeral-shroud STOP Long time the memory of that night--
    The hand that clasped, the lips that kissed,
  The form that faded from his sight
    Slow sinking through the tearful mist--
  In dreamy music seemed to roll
  Through the dark chambers of his soul STOP So after many years he came
    A wanderer from a distant shore:
  The street, the house, were still the same,
    But those he sought were there no more:
  His burning words, his hopes and fears,
  Unheeded fell on alien ears STOP Only the children from their play
    Would pause the mournful tale to hear,
  Shrinking in half-alarm away,
    Or, step by step, would venture near
  To touch with timid curious hands
  That strange wild man from other lands STOP He sat beside the busy street,
    There, where he last had seen her face:
  And thronging memories, bitter-sweet,
    Seemed yet to haunt the ancient place:
  Her footfall ever floated near:
  Her voice was ever in his ear STOP He sometimes, as the daylight waned
    And evening mists began to roll,
  In half-soliloquy complained
    Of that black shadow on his soul,
  And blindly fanned, with cruel care,
  The ashes of a vain despair STOP The summer fled: the lonely man
    Still lingered out the lessening days;
  Still, as the night drew on, would scan
    Each passing face with closer gaze--
  Till, sick at heart, he turned away,
  And sighed "she will not come to-day. STOP So by degrees his spirit bent
    To mock its own despairing cry,
  In stern self-torture to invent
    New luxuries of agony,
  And people all the vacant space
  With visions of her perfect face STOP Then for a moment she was nigh,
    He heard no step, but she was there;
  As if an angel suddenly
    Were bodied from the viewless air,
  And all her fine ethereal frame
  Should fade as swiftly as it came STOP So, half in fancy's sunny trance,
    And half in misery's aching void
  With set and stony countenance
    His bitter being he enjoyed,
  And thrust for ever from his mind
  The happiness he could not find STOP As when the wretch, in lonely room,
    To selfish death is madly hurled,
  The glamour of that fatal fume
    Shuts out the wholesome living world--
  So all his manhood's strength and pride
  One sickly dream had swept aside STOP Yea, brother, and we passed him there,
    But yesterday, in merry mood,
  And marveled at the lordly air
    That shamed his beggar's attitude,
  Nor heeded that ourselves might be
  Wretches as desperate as he;

  Who let the thought of bliss denied
    Make havoc of our life and powers,
  And pine, in solitary pride,
    For peace that never shall be ours,
  Because we will not work and wait
  In trustful patience for our fate STOP And so it chanced once more that she
    Came by the old familiar spot:
  The face he would have died to see
    Bent o'er him, and he knew it not;
  Too rapt in selfish grief to hear,
  Even when happiness was near STOP And pity filled her gentle breast
    For him that would not stir nor speak
  The dying crimson of the west,
    That faintly tinged his haggard cheek,
  Fell on her as she stood, and shed
  A glory round the patient head STOP Ah, let him wake STOP The moments fly:
    This awful tryst may be the last STOP And see, the tear, that dimmed her eye,
    Had fallen on him ere she passed--
  She passed: the crimson paled to gray:
  And hope departed with the day STOP The heavy hours of night went by,
    And silence quickened into sound,
  And light slid up the eastern sky,
    And life began its daily round--
  But light and life for him were fled:
  His name was numbered with the dead STOP _Nov., 1861._


[Illustration]




THE PATH OF ROSES STOP In the dark silence of an ancient room,
  Whose one tall window fronted to the West,
  Where, through laced tendrils of a hanging vine,
  The sunset-glow was fading into night,
  Sat a pale Lady, resting weary hands
  Upon a great clasped volume, and her face
  Within her hands STOP Not as in rest she bowed,
  But large hot tears were coursing down her cheek,
  And her low-panted sobs broke awefully
  Upon the sleeping echoes of the night STOP Soon she unclasp'd the volume once again,
  And read the words in tone of agony,
  As in self-torture, weeping as she read:--

  _"He crowns the glory of his race:
  He prayeth but in some fit place
  To meet his foeman face to face:

  "And, battling for the True, the Right,
  From ruddy dawn to purple night,
  To perish in the midmost fight:

  "Where hearts are fierce and hands are strong,
  Where peals the bugle loud and long,
  Where blood is dropping in the throng:

  "Still, with a dim and glazing eye,
  To watch the tide of victory,
  To hear in death the battle-cry:

  "Then, gathered grandly to his grave,
  To rest among the true and brave,
  In holy ground, where yew-trees wave:

  "Where, from church-windows sculptured fair,
  Float out upon the evening air
  The note of praise, the voice of prayer:

  "Where no vain marble mockery
  Insults with loud and boastful lie
  The simple soldier's memory:

  "Where sometimes little children go,
  And read, in whisper'd accent slow,
  The name of him who sleeps below STOP "_

  Her voice died out: like one in dreams she sat STOP "Alas! STOP she sighed STOP "For what can Woman do STOP Her life is aimless, and her death unknown:
  Hemmed in by social forms she pines in vain STOP Man has his work, but what can Woman do? STOP And answer came there from the creeping gloom,
  The creeping gloom that settled into night:
  "Peace STOP For thy lot is other than a man's:
  His is a path of thorns: he beats them down:
  He faces death: he wrestles with despair STOP Thine is of roses, to adorn and cheer
  His lonely life, and hide the thorns in flowers. STOP She spake again: in bitter tone she spake:
  "Aye, as a toy, the puppet of an hour,
  Or a fair posy, newly plucked at morn,
  But flung aside and withered ere the night. STOP And answer came there from the creeping gloom,
  The creeping gloom that blackened into night:
  "So shalt thou be the lamp to light his path,
  What time the shades of sorrow close around. STOP And, so it seemed to her, an awful light
  Pierced slowly through the darkness, orbed, and grew,
  Until all passed away--the ancient room--
  The sunlight dying through the trellised vine--
  The one tall window--all had passed away,
  And she was standing on the mighty hills STOP Beneath, around, and far as eye could see,
  Squadron on squadron, stretched opposing hosts,
  Ranked as for battle, mute and motionless STOP Anon a distant thunder shook the ground,
  The tramp of horses, and a troop shot by--
  Plunged headlong in that living sea of men--
  Plunged to their death: back from that fatal field
  A scattered handful, fighting hard for life,
  Broke through the serried lines; but, as she gazed,
  They shrank and melted, and their forms grew thin--
  Grew pale as ghosts when the first morning ray
  Dawns from the East--the trumpet's brazen blare
  Died into silence--and the vision passed--
  Passed to a room where sick and dying lay
  In long, sad line--there brooded Fear and Pain--
  Darkness was there, the shade of Azrael's wing STOP But there was one that ever, to and fro,
  Moved with light footfall: purely calm her face,
  And those deep steadfast eyes that starred the gloom:
  Still, as she went, she ministered to each
  Comfort and counsel; cooled the fevered brow
  With softest touch, and in the listening ear
  Of the pale sufferer whispered words of peace STOP The dying warrior, gazing as she passed,
  Clasped his thin hands and blessed her STOP Bless her too,
  Thou, who didst bless the merciful of old STOP So prayed the Lady, watching tearfully
  Her gentle moving onward, till the night
  Had veiled her wholly, and the vision passed STOP Then once again the solemn whisper came:
  "So in the darkest path of man's despair,
  Where War and Terror shake the troubled earth,
  Lies woman's mission; with unblenching brow
  To pass through scenes of horror and affright
  Where men grow sick and tremble: unto her
  All things are sanctified, for all are good STOP Nothing so mean, but shall deserve her care:
  Nothing so great, but she may bear her part STOP No life is vain: each hath his place assigned:
  Do thou thy task, and leave the rest to God. STOP And there was silence, but the Lady made
  No answer, save one deeply-breathed "Amen. STOP And she arose, and in that darkening room
  Stood lonely as a spirit of the night--
  Stood calm and fearless in the gathered night--
  And raised her eyes to heaven STOP There were tears
  Upon her face, but in her heart was peace,
  Peace that the world nor gives nor takes away STOP _April 10, 1856._


[Illustration]




THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH STOP Hark, _said the dying man_, _and sighed_,
      To that complaining tone--
  Like sprite condemned, each eventide,
      To walk the world alone STOP At sunset, when the air is still,
  I hear it creep from yonder hill:
  It breathes upon me, dead and chill,
      A moment, and is gone STOP My son, it minds me of a day
      Left half a life behind,
  That I have prayed to put away
      For ever from my mind STOP But bitter memory will not die:
  It haunts my soul when none is nigh:
  I hear its whisper in the sigh
      Of that complaining wind STOP And now in death my soul is fain
      To tell the tale of fear
  That hidden in my breast hath lain
      Through many a weary year:
  Yet time would fail to utter all--
  The evil spells that held me thrall,
  And thrust my life from fall to fall,
      Thou needest not to hear STOP The spells that bound me with a chain,
      Sin's stern behests to do,
  Till Pleasure's self, invoked in vain,
      A heavy burden grew--
  Till from my spirit's fevered eye,
  A hunted thing, I seemed to fly
  Through the dark woods that underlie
      Yon mountain-range of blue STOP Deep in those woods I found a vale
      No sunlight visiteth,
  Nor star, nor wandering moonbeam pale;
      Where never comes the breath
  Of summer-breeze--there in mine ear,
  Even as I lingered half in fear,
  I heard a whisper, cold and clear,
      "This is the gate of Death STOP "O bitter is it to abide
      In weariness alway:
  At dawn to sigh for eventide,
      At eventide for day STOP Thy noon hath fled: thy sun hath shone STOP The brightness of thy day is gone:
  What need to lag and linger on
      Till life be cold and gray STOP "O well," it said, "beneath yon pool,
      In some still cavern deep,
  The fevered brain might slumber cool,
      The eyes forget to weep:
  Within that goblet's mystic rim
  Are draughts of healing, stored for him
  Whose heart is sick, whose sight is dim,
      Who prayeth but to sleep! STOP The evening-breeze went moaning by,
      Like mourner for the dead,
  And stirred, with shrill complaining sigh,
      The tree-tops overhead:
  My guardian-angel seemed to stand
  And mutely wave a warning hand--
  With sudden terror all unmanned,
      I turned myself and fled STOP A cottage-gate stood open wide:
      Soft fell the dying ray
  On two fair children, side by side,
      That rested from their play--
  Together bent the earnest head,
  As ever and anon they read
  From one dear Book: the words they said
      Come back to me to-day STOP Like twin cascades on mountain-stair
      Together wandered down
  The ripples of the golden hair,
      The ripples of the brown:
  While, through the tangled silken haze,
  Blue eyes looked forth in eager gaze,
  More starlike than the gems that blaze
      About a monarch's crown STOP My son, there comes to each an hour
      When sinks the spirit's pride--
  When weary hands forget their power
      The strokes of death to guide:
  In such a moment, warriors say,
  A word the panic-rout may stay,
  A sudden charge redeem the day
      And turn the living tide STOP I could not see, for blinding tears,
      The glories of the west:
  A heavenly music filled mine ears,
      A heavenly peace my breast STOP "Come unto Me, come unto Me--
  All ye that labour, unto Me--
  Ye heavy-laden, come to Me--
      And I will give you rest. STOP The night drew onward: thin and blue
      The evening mists arise
  To bathe the thirsty land in dew,
      As erst in Paradise--
  While, over silent field and town,
  The deep blue vault of heaven looked down;
  Not, as of old, in angry frown,
      But bright with angels' eyes STOP Blest day STOP Then first I heard the voice
      That since hath oft beguiled
  These eyes from tears, and bid rejoice
      This heart with anguish wild--
  Thy mother, boy, thou hast not known;
  So soon she left me here to moan--
  Left me to weep and watch, alone,
      Our one beloved child STOP Though, parted from my aching sight,
      Like homeward-speeding dove,
  She passed into the perfect light
      That floods the world above;
  Yet our twin spirits, well I know--
  Though one abide in pain below--
  Love, as in summers long ago,
      And evermore shall love STOP So with a glad and patient heart
      I move toward mine end:
  The streams, that flow awhile apart,
      Shall both in ocean blend STOP I dare not weep: I can but bless
  The Love that pitied my distress,
  And lent me, in Life's wilderness,
      So sweet and true a friend STOP But if there be--O if there be
      A truth in what they say,
  That angel-forms we cannot see
      Go with us on our way;
  Then surely she is with me here,
  I dimly feel her spirit near--
  The morning-mists grow thin and clear,
      And Death brings in the Day STOP _April, 1868._


[Illustration]




SOLITUDE STOP I love the stillness of the wood:
    I love the music of the rill:
  I love to couch in pensive mood
        Upon some silent hill STOP Scarce heard, beneath yon arching trees,
    The silver-crested ripples pass;
  And, like a mimic brook, the breeze
        Whispers among the grass STOP Here from the world I win release,
    Nor scorn of men, nor footstep rude,
  Break in to mar the holy peace
        Of this great solitude STOP Here may the silent tears I weep
    Lull the vexed spirit into rest,
  As infants sob themselves to sleep
        Upon a mother's breast STOP But when the bitter hour is gone,
    And the keen throbbing pangs are still,
  Oh sweetest then to couch alone
        Upon some silent hill STOP To live in joys that once have been,
    To put the cold world out of sight,
  And deck life's drear and barren scene
        With hues of rainbow-light STOP For what to man the gift of breath,
    If sorrow be his lot below;
  If all the day that ends in death
        Be dark with clouds of woe STOP Shall the poor transport of an hour
    Repay long years of sore distress--
  The fragrance of a lonely flower
        Make glad the wilderness STOP Ye golden hours of Life's young spring,
    Of innocence, of love and truth STOP Bright, beyond all imagining,
        Thou fairy-dream of youth STOP I'd give all wealth that years have piled,
    The slow result of Life's decay,
  To be once more a little child
        For one bright summer-day STOP _March 16, 1853._




FAR AWAY STOP He stept so lightly to the land,
      All in his manly pride:
  He kissed her cheek, he clasped her hand;
      Yet still she glanced aside STOP "Too gay he seems," she darkly dreams,
      "Too gallant and too gay,
  To think of me--poor simple me--
      When he is far away! STOP "I bring my Love this goodly pearl
      Across the seas," he said:
  "A gem to deck the dearest girl
      That ever sailor wed! STOP She holds it tight: her eyes are bright:
      Her throbbing heart would say
  "He thought of me--he thought of me--
      When he was far away! STOP The ship has sailed into the West:
      Her ocean-bird is flown:
  A dull dead pain is in her breast,
      And she is weak and lone:
  But there's a smile upon her face,
      A smile that seems to say
  "He'll think of me--he'll think of me--
      When he is far away STOP "Though waters wide between us glide,
      Our lives are warm and near:
  No distance parts two faithful hearts--
      Two hearts that love so dear:
  And I will trust my sailor-lad,
      For ever and a day,
  To think of me--to think of me--
      When he is far away! STOP [Illustration]




BEATRICE STOP In her eyes is the living light
    Of a wanderer to earth
  From a far celestial height:
      Summers five are all the span--
      Summers five since Time began
  To veil in mists of human night
    A shining angel-birth STOP Does an angel look from her eyes STOP Will she suddenly spring away,
  And soar to her home in the skies STOP Beatrice STOP Blessing and blessed to be STOP Beatrice STOP Still, as I gaze on thee,
  Visions of two sweet maids arise,
    Whose life was of yesterday:

  Of a Beatrice pale and stern,
    With the lips of a dumb despair,
  With the innocent eyes that yearn--
      Yearn for the young sweet hours of life,
      Far from sorrow and far from strife,
  For the happy summers, that never return,
    When the world seemed good and fair:

  Of a Beatrice glorious, bright--
    Of a sainted, ethereal maid,
  Whose blue eyes are deep fountains of light,
      Cheering the poet that broodeth apart,
      Filling with gladness his desolate heart,
  Like the moon when she shines thro' a cloudless night
    On a world of silence and shade STOP And the visions waver and faint,
    And the visions vanish away
  That my fancy delighted to paint--
      She is here at my side, a living child,
      With the glowing cheek and the tresses wild,
  Nor death-pale martyr, nor radiant saint,
    Yet stainless and bright as they STOP For I think, if a grim wild beast
    Were to come from his charnel-cave,
  From his jungle-home in the East--
      Stealthily creeping with bated breath,
      Stealthily creeping with eyes of death--
  He would all forget his dream of the feast,
    And crouch at her feet a slave STOP She would twine her hand in his mane:
    She would prattle in silvery tone,
  Like the tinkle of summer-rain--
      Questioning him with her laughing eyes,
      Questioning him with a glad surprise,
  Till she caught from those fierce eyes again
    The love that lit her own STOP And be sure, if a savage heart,
    In a mask of human guise,
  Were to come on her here apart--
      Bound for a dark and a deadly deed,
      Hurrying past with pitiless speed--
  He would suddenly falter and guiltily start
    At the glance of her pure blue eyes STOP Nay, be sure, if an angel fair,
    A bright seraph undefiled,
  Were to stoop from the trackless air,
      Fain would she linger in glad amaze--
      Lovingly linger to ponder and gaze,
  With a sister's love and a sister's care,
    On the happy, innocent child STOP _Dec STOP 4, 1862._

STOLEN WATERS STOP The light was faint, and soft the air
        That breathed around the place;
  And she was lithe, and tall, and fair,
        And with a wayward grace
        Her queenly head she bare STOP With glowing cheek, with gleaming eye,
        She met me on the way:
  My spirit owned the witchery
        Within her smile that lay:
  I followed her, I knew not why STOP The trees were thick with many a fruit,
        The grass with many a flower:
  My soul was dead, my tongue was mute,
        In that accursed hour STOP And, in my dream, with silvery voice,
        She said, or seemed to say,
  "Youth is the season to rejoice--"
        I could not choose but stay:
        I could not say her nay STOP She plucked a branch above her head,
        With rarest fruitage laden:
  "Drink of the juice, Sir Knight," she said:
        "'Tis good for knight and maiden. STOP Oh, blind mine eye that would not trace--
    Oh, deaf mine ear that would not heed--
  The mocking smile upon her face,
        The mocking voice of greed STOP I drank the juice; and straightway felt
        A fire within my brain:
  My soul within me seemed to melt
        In sweet delirious pain STOP "Sweet is the stolen draught," she said:
        "Hath sweetness stint or measure STOP Pleasant the secret hoard of bread:
        What bars us from our pleasure? STOP "Yea, take we pleasure while we may,"
        I heard myself replying STOP In the red sunset, far away,
        My happier life was dying:
  My heart was sad, my voice was gay STOP And unawares, I knew not how,
    I kissed her dainty finger-tips,
  I kissed her on the lily brow,
    I kissed her on the false, false lips--
  That burning kiss, I feel it now STOP "True love gives true love of the best:
    Then take," I cried, "my heart to thee! STOP The very heart from out my breast
    I plucked, I gave it willingly:
    Her very heart she gave to me--
  Then died the glory from the west STOP In the gray light I saw her face,
    And it was withered, old, and gray;
  The flowers were fading in their place,
    Were fading with the fading day STOP Forth from her, like a hunted deer,
    Through all that ghastly night I fled,
  And still behind me seemed to hear
        Her fierce unflagging tread;
  And scarce drew breath for fear STOP Yet marked I well how strangely seemed
    The heart within my breast to sleep:
  Silent it lay, or so I dreamed,
        With never a throb or leap STOP For hers was now my heart, she said,
    The heart that once had been mine own:
  And in my breast I bore instead
        A cold, cold heart of stone STOP So grew the morning overhead STOP The sun shot downward through the trees
        His old familiar flame:
  All ancient sounds upon the breeze
        From copse and meadow came--
        But I was not the same STOP They call me mad: I smile, I weep,
        Uncaring how or why:
  Yea, when one's heart is laid asleep,
        What better than to die STOP So that the grave be dark and deep STOP To die STOP To die STOP And yet, methinks,
        I drink of life, to-day,
  Deep as the thirsty traveler drinks
        Of fountain by the way:
  My voice is sad, my heart is gay STOP When yestereve was on the wane,
        I heard a clear voice singing
  So sweetly that, like summer-rain,
        My happy tears came springing:
  My human heart returned again STOP _"A rosy child,
  Sitting and singing, in a garden fair,
      The joy of hearing, seeing,
      The simple joy of being--
  Or twining rosebuds in the golden hair
      That ripples free and wild STOP "A sweet pale child--
  Wearily looking to the purple West--
      Waiting the great For-ever
      That suddenly shall sever
  The cruel chains that hold her from her rest--
      By earth-joys unbeguiled STOP "An angel-child--
  Gazing with living eyes on a dead face:
      The mortal form forsaken,
      That none may now awaken,
  That lieth painless, moveless in her place,
      As though in death she smiled STOP "Be as a child--
  So shalt thou sing for very joy of breath--
      So shalt thou wait thy dying,
      In holy transport lying--
  So pass rejoicing through the gate of death,
      In garment undefiled STOP "_

  Then call me what they will, I know
        That now my soul is glad:
  If this be madness, better so,
        Far better to be mad,
  Weeping or smiling as I go STOP For if I weep, it is that now
    I see how deep a loss is mine,
  And feel how brightly round my brow
        The coronal might shine,
  Had I but kept mine early vow:

  And if I smile, it is that now
    I see the promise of the years--
  The garland waiting for my brow,
        That must be won with tears,
  With pain--with death--I care not how STOP _May 9, 1862._

THE WILLOW-TREE STOP The morn was bright, the steeds were light,
      The wedding guests were gay:
  Young Ellen stood within the wood
      And watched them pass away STOP She scarcely saw the gallant train:
      The tear-drop dimmed her ee:
  Unheard the maiden did complain
      Beneath the Willow-Tree STOP "Oh Robin, thou didst love me well,
      Till, on a bitter day,
  She came, the Lady Isabel,
      And stole thy heart away STOP My tears are vain: I live again
      In days that used to be,
  When I could meet thy welcome feet
      Beneath the Willow-Tree STOP "Oh Willow gray, I may not stay
      Till Spring renew thy leaf;
  But I will hide myself away,
      And nurse a lonely grief STOP It shall not dim Life's joy for him:
      My tears he shall not see:
  While he is by, I'll come not nigh
      My weeping Willow-Tree STOP "But when I die, oh let me lie
      Beneath thy loving shade,
  That he may loiter careless by,
      Where I am lowly laid STOP And let the white white marble tell,
      If he should stoop to see,
  'Here lies a maid that loved thee well,
      Beneath the Willow-Tree.' STOP 1859 STOP ONLY A WOMAN'S HAIR STOP 'Only a woman's hair' STOP Fling it aside STOP A bubble on Life's mighty stream:
  Heed it not, man, but watch the broadening tide
        Bright with the western beam STOP Nay STOP In those words there rings from other years
    The echo of a long low cry,
  Where a proud spirit wrestles with its tears
        In loneliest agony STOP And, as I touch that lock, strange visions throng
    Upon my soul with dreamy grace--
  Of woman's hair, the theme of poet's song
        In every time and place STOP A child's bright tresses, by the breezes kissed
    To sweet disorder as she flies,
  Veiling, beneath a cloud of golden mist,
        Flushed cheek and laughing eyes--

  Or fringing, like a shadow, raven-black,
    The glory of a queen-like face--
  Or from a gipsy's sunny brow tossed back
        In wild and wanton grace--

  Or crown-like on the hoary head of Age,
    Whose tale of life is well-nigh told--
  Or, last, in dreams I make my pilgrimage
        To Bethany of old STOP I see the feast--the purple and the gold--
    The gathering crowd of Pharisees,
  Whose scornful eyes are centred to behold
        Yon woman on her knees STOP The stifled sob rings strangely on mine ears,
    Wrung from the depth of sin's despair:
  And still she bathes the sacred feet with tears,
        And wipes them with her hair STOP He scorned not then the simple loving deed
    Of her, the lowest and the last;
  Then scorn not thou, but use with earnest heed
        This relic of the past STOP The eyes that loved it once no longer wake:
    So lay it by with reverent care--
  Touching it tenderly for sorrow's sake--
        It is a woman's hair STOP _Feb STOP 17, 1862._

THE SAILOR'S WIFE STOP See STOP There are tears upon her face--
    Tears newly shed, and scarcely dried:
  Close, in an agonised embrace,
    She clasps the infant at her side STOP Peace dwells in those soft-lidded eyes,
    Those parted lips that faintly smile--
  Peace, the foretaste of Paradise,
    In heart too young for care or guile STOP No peace that mother's features wear;
    But quivering lip, and knotted brow,
  And broken mutterings, all declare
    The fearful dream that haunts her now STOP The storm-wind, rushing through the sky,
    Wails from the depths of cloudy space;
  Shrill, piercing as the seaman's cry
    When death and he are face to face STOP Familiar tones are in the gale:
    They ring upon her startled ear:
  And quick and low she pants the tale
    That tells of agony and fear:

  "Still that phantom-ship is nigh--
    With a vexed and life-like motion,
  All beneath an angry sky,
    Rocking on an angry ocean STOP "Round the straining mast and shrouds
    Throng the spirits of the storm:
  Darkly seen through driving clouds,
    Bends each gaunt and ghastly form STOP "See STOP The good ship yields at last STOP Dumbly yields, and fights no more;
  Driving, in the frantic blast,
    Headlong on the fatal shore STOP "Hark STOP I hear her battered side,
    With a low and sullen shock,
  Dashed, amid the foaming tide,
    Full upon a sunken rock STOP "His face shines out against the sky,
    Like a ghost, so cold and white;
  With a dead despairing eye
    Gazing through the gathered night STOP "Is he watching, through the dark
    Where a mocking ghostly hand
  Points a faint and feeble spark
    Glimmering from the distant land STOP "Sees he, in this hour of dread,
    Hearth and home and wife and child STOP Loved ones who, in summers fled,
    Clung to him and wept and smiled STOP "Reeling sinks the fated bark
    To her tomb beneath the wave:
  Must he perish in the dark--
    Not a hand stretched out to save STOP "See the spirits, how they crowd STOP Watching death with eyes that burn STOP Waves rush in----" she shrieks aloud,
    Ere her waking sense return STOP The storm is gone: the skies are clear:
    Hush'd is that bitter cry of pain:
  The only sound, that meets her ear,
    The heaving of the sullen main STOP Though heaviness endure the night,
    Yet joy shall come with break of day:
  She shudders with a strange delight--
    The fearful dream is pass'd away STOP She wakes: the grey dawn streaks the dark:
    With early song the copses ring:
  Far off she hears the watch-dog bark
    A joyful bark of welcoming STOP _Feb STOP 23, 1857._

AFTER THREE DAYS STOP I stood within the gate
  Of a great temple, 'mid the living stream
  Of worshipers that thronged its regal state
      Fair-pictured in my dream STOP Jewels and gold were there;
  And floors of marble lent a crystal sheen
  To body forth, as in a lower air,
      The wonders of the scene STOP Such wild and lavish grace
  Had whispers in it of a coming doom;
  As richest flowers lie strown about the face
      Of her that waits the tomb STOP The wisest of the land
  Had gathered there, three solemn trysting-days,
  For high debate: men stood on either hand
      To listen and to gaze STOP The aged brows were bent,
  Bent to a frown, half thought, and half annoy,
  That all their stores of subtlest argument
      Were baffled by a boy STOP In each averted face
  I marked but scorn and loathing, till mine eyes
  Fell upon one that stirred not in his place,
      Tranced in a dumb surprise STOP Surely within his mind
  Strange thoughts are born, until he doubts the lore
  Of those old men, blind leaders of the blind,
      Whose kingdom is no more STOP Surely he sees afar
  A day of death the stormy future brings;
  The crimson setting of the herald-star
      That led the Eastern kings STOP Thus, as a sunless deep
  Mirrors the shining heights that crown the bay,
  So did my soul create anew in sleep
      The picture seen by day STOP Gazers came and went--
  A restless hum of voices marked the spot--
  In varying shades of critic discontent
      Prating they knew not what STOP "Where is the comely limb,
  The form attuned in every perfect part,
  The beauty that we should desire in him? STOP Ah STOP Fools and slow of heart STOP Look into those deep eyes,
  Deep as the grave, and strong with love divine;
  Those tender, pure, and fathomless mysteries,
      That seem to pierce through thine STOP Look into those deep eyes,
  Stirred to unrest by breath of coming strife,
  Until a longing in thy soul arise
      That this indeed were life:

      That thou couldst find Him there,
  Bend at His sacred feet thy willing knee,
  And from thy heart pour out the passionate prayer
      "Lord, let me follow Thee! STOP But see the crowd divide:
  Mother and sire have found their lost one now:
  The gentle voice, that fain would seem to chide
      Whispers "Son, why hast thou"--

      In tone of sad amaze--
  "Thus dealt with us, that art our dearest thing STOP Behold, thy sire and I, three weary days,
      Have sought thee sorrowing. STOP And I had stayed to hear
  The loving words "How is it that ye sought? STOP --
  But that the sudden lark, with matins clear,
      Severed the links of thought STOP Then over all there fell
  Shadow and silence; and my dream was fled,
  As fade the phantoms of a wizard's cell
      When the dark charm is said STOP Yet, in the gathering light,
  I lay with half-shut eyes that would not wake,
  Lovingly clinging to the skirts of night
      For that sweet vision's sake STOP _Feb STOP 16, 1861._

FACES IN THE FIRE STOP The night creeps onward, sad and slow:
  In these red embers' dying glow
  The forms of Fancy come and go STOP An island-farm--broad seas of corn
  Stirred by the wandering breath of morn--
  The happy spot where I was born STOP The picture fadeth in its place:
  Amid the glow I seem to trace
  The shifting semblance of a face STOP 'Tis now a little childish form--
  Red lips for kisses pouted warm--
  And elf-locks tangled in the storm STOP 'Tis now a grave and gentle maid,
  At her own beauty half afraid,
  Shrinking, and willing to be stayed STOP Oh, Time was young, and Life was warm,
  When first I saw that fairy-form,
  Her dark hair tossing in the storm STOP And fast and free these pulses played,
  When last I met that gentle maid--
  When last her hand in mine was laid STOP Those locks of jet are turned to gray,
  And she is strange and far away
  That might have been mine own to-day--

  That might have been mine own, my dear,
  Through many and many a happy year--
  That might have sat beside me here STOP Ay, changeless through the changing scene,
  The ghostly whisper rings between,
  The dark refrain of 'might have been. STOP The race is o'er I might have run:
  The deeds are past I might have done;
  And sere the wreath I might have won STOP Sunk is the last faint flickering blaze:
  The vision of departed days
  Is vanished even as I gaze STOP The pictures, with their ruddy light,
  Are changed to dust and ashes white,
  And I am left alone with night STOP _Jan., 1860._

A LESSON IN LATIN STOP Our Latin books, in motley row,
      Invite us to our task--
  Gay Horace, stately Cicero:
  Yet there's one verb, when once we know,
      No higher skill we ask:
  This ranks all other lore above--
  We've learned "'_Amare_' means '_to love_'! STOP So, hour by hour, from flower to flower,
      We sip the sweets of Life:
  Till, all too soon, the clouds arise,
  And flaming cheeks and flashing eyes
      Proclaim the dawn of strife:
  With half a smile and half a sigh,
  "_Amare STOP Bitter One!_" we cry STOP Last night we owned, with looks forlorn,
      "Too well the scholar knows
  There is no rose without a thorn"--
  But peace is made STOP We sing, this morn,
      "No thorn without a rose! STOP Our Latin lesson is complete:
  We've learned that Love is Bitter-Sweet STOP _May, 1888._




PUCK LOST AND FOUND STOP Puck has fled the haunts of men:
    Ridicule has made him wary:
  In the woods, and down the glen,
        No one meets a Fairy STOP "Cream! STOP the greedy Goblin cries--
    Empties the deserted dairy--
  Steals the spoons, and off he flies STOP Still we seek our Fairy STOP Ah STOP What form is entering STOP Lovelit eyes and laughter airy STOP Is not this a better thing,
  Child, whose visit thus I sing,
        Even than a Fairy STOP _Nov STOP 22, 1891._

  Puck has ventured back agen:
    Ridicule no more affrights him:
  In the very haunts of men
        Newer sport delights him STOP Capering lightly to and fro,
    Ever frolicking and funning--
  "Crack! STOP the mimic pistols go STOP Hark STOP The noise is stunning STOP All too soon will Childhood gay
    Realise Life's sober sadness STOP Let's be merry while we may,
  Innocent and happy Fay STOP Elves were made for gladness STOP _Nov STOP 25, 1891._

A SONG OF LOVE STOP Say, what is the spell, when her fledgelings are cheeping,
        That lures the bird home to her nest STOP Or wakes the tired mother, whose infant is weeping,
        To cuddle and croon it to rest STOP What the magic that charms the glad babe in her arms,
        Till it cooes with the voice of the dove STOP 'Tis a secret, and so let us whisper it low--
        And the name of the secret is Love STOP For I think it is Love,
              For I feel it is Love,
        For I'm sure it is nothing but Love STOP Say, whence is the voice that, when anger is burning,
        Bids the whirl of the tempest to cease STOP That stirs the vexed soul with an aching--a yearning
        For the brotherly hand-grip of peace STOP Whence the music that fills all our being--that thrills
        Around us, beneath, and above STOP 'Tis a secret: none knows how it comes, how it goes--
        But the name of the secret is Love STOP For I think it is Love,
              For I feel it is Love,
        For I'm sure it is nothing but Love STOP Say, whose is the skill that paints valley and hill,
        Like a picture so fair to the sight STOP That flecks the green meadow with sunshine and shadow,
        Till the little lambs leap with delight STOP 'Tis a secret untold to hearts cruel and cold,
        Though 'tis sung, by the angels above,
  In notes that ring clear for the ears that can hear--
        And the name of the secret is Love STOP For I think it is Love,
              For I feel it is Love,
        For I'm sure it is nothing but Love STOP _Oct., 1886._
