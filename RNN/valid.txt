                   The Old Curiosity Shop    By Charles Dickens              Although I am an old man, night is generally my time for walking.
 In the  summer I often leave home early in the morning, and roam about fields  and lanes all day, or even escape for days or weeks together; but,  saving in the country, I seldom go out until after dark, though, Heaven  be thanked, I love its light and feel the cheerfulness it sheds upon the  earth, as much as any creature living.
    I have fallen insensibly into this habit, both because it favours my  infirmity and because it affords me greater opportunity of speculating  on the characters and occupations of those who fill the streets.
 The  glare and hurry of broad noon are not adapted to idle pursuits like  mine; a glimpse of passing faces caught by the light of a street-lamp  or a shop window is often better for my purpose than their full  revelation in the daylight; and, if I must add the truth, night is  kinder in this respect than day, which too often destroys an air-built  castle at the moment of its completion, without the least ceremony or  remorse.
    That constant pacing to and fro, that never-ending restlessness, that  incessant tread of feet wearing the rough stones smooth and glossy--is  it not a wonder how the dwellers in narrows ways can bear to hear it!  Think of a sick man in such a place as Saint Martin's Court, listening  to the footsteps, and in the midst of pain and weariness obliged,  despite himself (as though it were a task he must perform) to detect  the child's step from the man's, the slipshod beggar from the booted  exquisite, the lounging from the busy, the dull heel of the sauntering  outcast from the quick tread of an expectant pleasure-seeker--think of  the hum and noise always being present to his sense, and of the stream  of life that will not stop, pouring on, on, on, through all his  restless dreams, as if he were condemned to lie, dead but conscious, in  a noisy churchyard, and had no hope of rest for centuries to come.
    Then, the crowds for ever passing and repassing on the bridges (on  those which are free of toll at last), where many stop on fine evenings  looking listlessly down upon the water with some vague idea that by and  by it runs between green banks which grow wider and wider until at last  it joins the broad vast sea--where some halt to rest from heavy loads  and think as they look over the parapet that to smoke and lounge away  one's life, and lie sleeping in the sun upon a hot tarpaulin, in a  dull, slow, sluggish barge, must be happiness unalloyed--and where  some, and a very different class, pause with heavier loads than they,  remembering to have heard or read in old time that drowning was not a  hard death, but of all means of suicide the easiest and best.
    Covent Garden Market at sunrise too, in the spring or summer, when the  fragrance of sweet flowers is in the air, over-powering even the  unwholesome streams of last night's debauchery, and driving the dusky  thrush, whose cage has hung outside a garret window all night long,  half mad with joy! Poor bird! the only neighbouring thing at all akin  to the other little captives, some of whom, shrinking from the hot  hands of drunken purchasers, lie drooping on the path already, while  others, soddened by close contact, await the time when they shall be  watered and freshened up to please more sober company, and make old  clerks who pass them on their road to business, wonder what has filled  their breasts with visions of the country.
    But my present purpose is not to expatiate upon my walks.
 The story I  am about to relate, and to which I shall recur at intervals,  arose out  of one of these rambles; and thus I have been led to speak of them by  way of preface.
    One night I had roamed into the City, and was walking slowly on in my  usual way, musing upon a great many things, when I was arrested by an  inquiry, the purport of which did not reach me, but which seemed to be  addressed to myself, and was preferred in a soft sweet voice that  struck me very pleasantly.
 I turned hastily round and found at my elbow  a pretty little girl, who begged to be directed to a certain street at  a considerable distance, and indeed in quite another quarter of the  town.
    'It is a very long way from here,' said I, 'my child.
'    'I know that, sir,' she replied timidly.
 'I am afraid it is a very long  way, for I came from there to-night.
'    'Alone?' said I, in some surprise.
    'Oh, yes, I don't mind that, but I am a little frightened now, for I  had lost my road.
'    'And what made you ask it of me? Suppose I should tell you wrong?'    'I am sure you will not do that,' said the little creature,' you are  such a very old gentleman, and walk so slow yourself.
'    I cannot describe how much I was impressed by this appeal and the  energy with which it was made, which brought a tear into the child's  clear eye, and made her slight figure tremble as she looked up into my  face.
    'Come,' said I, 'I'll take you there.
'    She put her hand in mine as confidingly as if she had known me from her  cradle, and we trudged away together; the little creature accommodating  her pace to mine, and rather seeming to lead and take care of me than I  to be protecting her.
 I observed that every now and then she stole a  curious look at my face, as if to make quite sure that I was not  deceiving her, and that these glances (very sharp and keen they were  too) seemed to increase her confidence at every repetition.
    For my part, my curiosity and interest were at least equal to the  child's, for child she certainly was, although I thought it probably  from what I could make out, that her very small and delicate frame  imparted a peculiar youthfulness to her appearance.
 Though more  scantily attired than she might have been she was dressed with perfect  neatness, and betrayed no marks of poverty or neglect.
    'Who has sent you so far by yourself?' said I.
    'Someone who is very kind to me, sir.
'    'And what have you been doing?'    'That, I must not tell,' said the child firmly.
    There was something in the manner of this reply which caused me to look  at the little creature with an involuntary expression of surprise; for  I wondered what kind of errand it might be that occasioned her to be  prepared for questioning.
 Her quick eye seemed to read my thoughts, for  as it met mine she added that there was no harm in what she had been  doing, but it was a great secret--a secret which she did not even know  herself.
    This was said with no appearance of cunning or deceit, but with an  unsuspicious frankness that bore the impress of truth.
 She walked on as  before, growing more familiar with me as we proceeded and talking  cheerfully by the way, but she said no more about her home, beyond  remarking that we were going quite a new road and asking if it were a  short one.
    While we were thus engaged, I revolved in my mind a hundred different  explanations of the riddle and rejected them every one.
 I really felt  ashamed to take advantage of the ingenuousness or grateful feeling of  the child for the purpose of gratifying my curiosity.
 I love these  little people; and it is not a slight thing when they, who are so fresh  from God, love us.
 As I had felt pleased at first by her confidence I  determined to deserve it, and to do credit to the nature which had  prompted her to repose it in me.
    There was no reason, however, why I should refrain from seeing the  person who had inconsiderately sent her to so great a distance by night  and alone, and as it was not improbable that if she found herself near  home she might take farewell of me and deprive me of the opportunity, I  avoided the most frequented ways and took the most intricate, and thus  it was not until we arrived in the street itself that she knew where we  were.
 Clapping her hands with pleasure and running on before me for a  short distance, my little acquaintance stopped at a door and remaining  on the step till I came up knocked at it when I joined her.
    A part of this door was of glass unprotected by any shutter, which I  did not observe at first, for all was very dark and silent within, and  I was anxious (as indeed the child was also) for an answer to our  summons.
 When she had knocked twice or thrice there was a noise as if  some person were moving inside, and at length a faint light appeared  through the glass which, as it approached very slowly, the bearer  having to make his way through a great many scattered articles, enabled  me to see both what kind of person it was who advanced and what kind of  place it was through which he came.
    It was an old man with long grey hair, whose face and figure as he held  the light above his head and looked before him as he approached, I  could plainly see.
 Though much altered by age, I fancied I could  recognize in his spare and slender form something of that delicate  mould which I had noticed in the child.
 Their bright blue eyes were  certainly alike, but his face was so deeply furrowed and so very full  of care, that here all resemblance ceased.
    The place through which he made his way at leisure was one of those  receptacles for old and curious things which seem to crouch in odd  corners of this town and to hide their musty treasures from the public  eye in jealousy and distrust.
 There were suits of mail standing like  ghosts in armour here and there, fantastic carvings brought from  monkish cloisters, rusty weapons of various kinds, distorted figures in  china and wood and iron and ivory: tapestry and strange furniture that  might have been designed in dreams.
 The haggard aspect of the little  old man was wonderfully suited to the place; he might have groped among  old churches and tombs and deserted houses and gathered all the spoils  with his own hands.
 There was nothing in the whole collection but was  in keeping with himself nothing that looked older or more worn than he.
    As he turned the key in the lock, he surveyed me with some astonishment  which was not diminished when he looked from me to my companion.
 The  door being opened, the child addressed him as grandfather, and told him  the little story of our companionship.
    'Why, bless thee, child,' said the old man, patting her on the head,  'how couldst thou miss thy way? What if I had lost thee, Nell!'    'I would have found my way back to YOU, grandfather,' said the child  boldly; 'never fear.
'    The old man kissed her, then turning to me and begging me to walk in, I  did so.
 The door was closed and locked.
 Preceding me with the light, he  led me through the place I had already seen from without, into a small  sitting-room behind, in which was another door opening into a kind of  closet, where I saw a little bed that a fairy might have slept in, it  looked so very small and was so prettily arranged.
 The child took a  candle and tripped into this little room, leaving the old man and me  together.
    'You must be tired, sir,' said he as he placed a chair near the fire,  'how can I thank you?'    'By taking more care of your grandchild another time, my good friend,'  I replied.
    'More care!' said the old man in a shrill voice, 'more care of Nelly!  Why, who ever loved a child as I love Nell?'    He said this with such evident surprise that I was perplexed what  answer to make, and the more so because coupled with something feeble  and wandering in his manner, there were in his face marks of deep and  anxious thought which convinced me that he could not be, as I had been  at first inclined to suppose, in a state of dotage or imbecility.
    'I don't think you consider--' I began.
    'I don't consider!' cried the old man interrupting me, 'I don't  consider her! Ah, how little you know of the truth! Little Nelly,  little Nelly!'    It would be impossible for any man, I care not what his form of speech  might be, to express more affection than the dealer in curiosities did,  in these four words.
 I waited for him to speak again, but he rested his  chin upon his hand and shaking his head twice or thrice fixed his eyes  upon the fire.
    While we were sitting thus in silence, the door of the closet opened,  and the child returned, her light brown hair hanging loose about her  neck, and her face flushed with the haste she had made to rejoin us.
  She busied herself immediately in preparing supper, and while she was  thus engaged I remarked that the old man took an opportunity of  observing me more closely than he had done yet.
 I was surprised to see  that all this time everything was done by the child, and that there  appeared to be no other persons but ourselves in the house.
 I took  advantage of a moment when she was absent to venture a hint on this  point, to which the old man replied that there were few grown persons  as trustworthy or as careful as she.
    'It always grieves me,' I observed, roused by what I took to be his  selfishness, 'it always grieves me to contemplate the initiation of  children into the ways of life, when they are scarcely more than  infants.
 It checks their confidence and simplicity--two of the best  qualities that Heaven gives them--and demands that they share our  sorrows before they are capable of entering into our enjoyments.
'    'It will never check hers,' said the old man looking steadily at me,  'the springs are too deep.
 Besides, the children of the poor know but  few pleasures.
 Even the cheap delights of childhood must be bought and  paid for.
'    'But--forgive me for saying this--you are surely not so very  poor'--said I.
    'She is not my child, sir,' returned the old man.
 'Her mother was, and  she was poor.
 I save nothing--not a penny--though I live as you see,  but'--he laid his hand upon my arm and leant forward to whisper--'she  shall be rich one of these days, and a fine lady.
 Don't you think ill  of me because I use her help.
 She gives it cheerfully as you see, and  it would break her heart if she knew that I suffered anybody else to do  for me what her little hands could undertake.
 I don't consider!'--he  cried with sudden querulousness, 'why, God knows that this one child is  the thought and object of my life, and yet he never prospers me--no,  never!'    At this juncture, the subject of our conversation again returned, and  the old man motioning to me to approach the table, broke off, and said  no more.
    We had scarcely begun our repast when there was a knock at the door by  which I had entered, and Nell bursting into a hearty laugh, which I was  rejoiced to hear, for it was childlike and full of hilarity, said it  was no doubt dear old Kit coming back at last.
    'Foolish Nell!' said the old man fondling with her hair.
 'She always  laughs at poor Kit.
'    The child laughed again more heartily than before, and I could not help  smiling from pure sympathy.
 The little old man took up a candle and  went to open the door.
 When he came back, Kit was at his heels.
    Kit was a shock-headed, shambling, awkward lad with an uncommonly wide  mouth, very red cheeks, a turned-up nose, and certainly the most  comical expression of face I ever saw.
 He stopped short at the door on  seeing a stranger, twirled in his hand a perfectly round old hat  without any vestige of a brim, and resting himself now on one leg and  now on the other and changing them constantly, stood in the doorway,  looking into the parlour with the most extraordinary leer I ever  beheld.
 I entertained a grateful feeling towards the boy from that  minute, for I felt that he was the comedy of the child's life.
    'A long way, wasn't it, Kit?' said the little old man.
    'Why, then, it was a goodish stretch, master,' returned Kit.
    'Of course you have come back hungry?'    'Why, then, I do consider myself rather so, master,' was the answer.
    The lad had a remarkable manner of standing sideways as he spoke, and  thrusting his head forward over his shoulder, as if he could not get at  his voice without that accompanying action.
 I think he would have  amused one anywhere, but the child's exquisite enjoyment of his oddity,  and the relief it was to find that there was something she associated  with merriment in a place that appeared so unsuited to her, were quite  irresistible.
 It was a great point too that Kit himself was flattered  by the sensation he created, and after several efforts to preserve his  gravity, burst into a loud roar, and so stood with his mouth wide open  and his eyes nearly shut, laughing violently.
    The old man had again relapsed into his former abstraction and took no  notice of what passed, but I remarked that when her laugh was over, the  child's bright eyes were dimmed with tears, called forth by the  fullness of heart with which she welcomed her uncouth favourite after  the little anxiety of the night.
 As for Kit himself (whose laugh had  been all the time one of that sort which very little would change into  a cry) he carried a large slice of bread and meat and a mug of beer  into a corner, and applied himself to disposing of them with great  voracity.
    'Ah!' said the old man turning to me with a sigh, as if I had spoken to  him but that moment, 'you don't know what you say when you tell me that  I don't consider her.
'    'You must not attach too great weight to a remark founded on first  appearances, my friend,' said I.
    'No,' returned the old man thoughtfully, 'no.
 Come hither, Nell.
'    The little girl hastened from her seat, and put her arm about his neck.
    'Do I love thee, Nell?' said he.
 'Say--do I love thee, Nell, or no?'    The child only answered by her caresses, and laid her head upon his  breast.
    'Why dost thou sob?' said the grandfather, pressing her closer to him  and glancing towards me.
 'Is it because thou know'st I love thee, and  dost not like that I should seem to doubt it by my question? Well,  well--then let us say I love thee dearly.
'    'Indeed, indeed you do,' replied the child with great earnestness, 'Kit  knows you do.
'    Kit, who in despatching his bread and meat had been swallowing  two-thirds of his knife at every mouthful with the coolness of a  juggler, stopped short in his operations on being thus appealed to, and  bawled 'Nobody isn't such a fool as to say he doosn't,' after which he  incapacitated himself for further conversation by taking a most  prodigious sandwich at one bite.
    'She is poor now'--said the old man, patting the child's cheek, 'but I  say again that the time is coming when she shall be rich.
 It has been a  long time coming, but it must come at last; a very long time, but it  surely must come.
 It has come to other men who do nothing but waste and  riot.
 When WILL it come to me!'    'I am very happy as I am, grandfather,' said the child.
    'Tush, tush!' returned the old man, 'thou dost not know--how should'st  thou!' then he muttered again between his teeth, 'The time must come, I  am very sure it must.
 It will be all the better for coming late'; and  then he sighed and fell into his former musing state, and still holding  the child between his knees appeared to be insensible to everything  around him.
 By this time it wanted but a few minutes of midnight and I  rose to go, which recalled him to himself.
    'One moment, sir,' he said, 'Now, Kit--near midnight, boy, and you  still here! Get home, get home, and be true to your time in the  morning, for there's work to do.
 Good night! There, bid him good night,  Nell, and let him be gone!'    'Good night, Kit,' said the child, her eyes lighting up with merriment  and kindness.
    'Good night, Miss Nell,' returned the boy.
    'And thank this gentleman,' interposed the old man, 'but for whose care  I might have lost my little girl to-night.
'    'No, no, master,' said Kit, 'that won't do, that won't.
'    'What do you mean?' cried the old man.
    'I'd have found her, master,' said Kit, 'I'd have found her.
 I'll bet  that I'd find her if she was above ground, I would, as quick as  anybody, master.
 Ha, ha, ha!'    Once more opening his mouth and shutting his eyes, and laughing like a  stentor, Kit gradually backed to the door, and roared himself out.
    Free of the room, the boy was not slow in taking his departure; when he  had gone, and the child was occupied in clearing the table, the old man  said:    'I haven't seemed to thank you, sir, for what you have done to-night,  but I do thank you humbly and heartily, and so does she, and her thanks  are better worth than mine.
 I should be sorry that you went away, and  thought I was unmindful of your goodness, or careless of her--I am not  indeed.
'    I was sure of that, I said, from what I had seen.
 'But,' I added, 'may  I ask you a question?'    'Ay, sir,' replied the old man, 'What is it?'    'This delicate child,' said I, 'with so much beauty and  intelligence--has she nobody to care for her but you? Has she no other  companion or advisor?'    'No,' he returned, looking anxiously in my face, 'no, and she wants no  other.
'    'But are you not fearful,' said I, 'that you may misunderstand a charge  so tender? I am sure you mean well, but are you quite certain that you  know how to execute such a trust as this? I am an old man, like you,  and I am actuated by an old man's concern in all that is young and  promising.
 Do you not think that what I have seen of you and this  little creature to-night must have an interest not wholly free from  pain?'    'Sir,' rejoined the old man after a moment's silence.
 'I have no right  to feel hurt at what you say.
 It is true that in many respects I am the  child, and she the grown person--that you have seen already.
 But waking  or sleeping, by night or day, in sickness or health, she is the one  object of my care, and if you knew of how much care, you would look on  me with different eyes, you would indeed.
 Ah! It's a weary life for an  old man--a weary, weary life--but there is a great end to gain and that  I keep before me.
'    Seeing that he was in a state of excitement and impatience, I turned to  put on an outer coat which I had thrown off on entering the room,  purposing to say no more.
 I was surprised to see the child standing  patiently by with a cloak upon her arm, and in her hand a hat, and  stick.
    'Those are not mine, my dear,' said I.
    'No,' returned the child, 'they are grandfather's.
'    'But he is not going out to-night.
'    'Oh, yes, he is,' said the child, with a smile.
    'And what becomes of you, my pretty one?'    'Me! I stay here of course.
 I always do.
'    I looked in astonishment towards the old man, but he was, or feigned to  be, busied in the arrangement of his dress.
 From him I looked back to  the slight gentle figure of the child.
 Alone! In that gloomy place all  the long, dreary night.
    She evinced no consciousness of my surprise, but cheerfully helped the  old man with his cloak, and when he was ready took a candle to light us  out.
 Finding that we did not follow as she expected, she looked back  with a smile and waited for us.
  The old man showed by his face that he  plainly understood the cause of my hesitation, but he merely signed to  me with an inclination of the head to pass out of the room before him,  and remained silent.
 I had no resource but to comply.
    When we reached the door, the child setting down the candle, turned to  say good night and raised her face to kiss me.
 Then she ran to the old  man, who folded her in his arms and bade God bless her.
    'Sleep soundly, Nell,' he said in a low voice, 'and angels guard thy  bed! Do not forget thy prayers, my sweet.
'    'No, indeed,' answered the child fervently, 'they make me feel so  happy!'    'That's well; I know they do; they should,' said the old man.
 'Bless  thee a hundred times! Early in the morning I shall be home.
'    'You'll not ring twice,' returned the child.
 'The bell wakes me, even  in the middle of a dream.
'    With this, they separated.
 The child opened the door (now guarded by a  shutter which I had heard the boy put up before he left the house) and  with another farewell whose clear and tender note I have recalled a  thousand times, held it until we had passed out.
 The old man paused a  moment while it was gently closed and fastened on the inside, and  satisfied that this was done, walked on at a slow pace.
 At the  street-corner he stopped, and regarding me with a troubled countenance  said that our ways were widely different and that he must take his  leave.
 I would have spoken, but summoning up more alacrity than might  have been expected in one of his appearance, he hurried away.
 I could  see that twice or thrice he looked back as if to ascertain if I were  still watching him, or perhaps to assure himself that I was not  following at a distance.
 The obscurity of the night favoured his  disappearance, and his figure was soon beyond my sight.
    I remained standing on the spot where he had left me, unwilling to  depart, and yet unknowing why I should loiter there.
 I looked wistfully  into the street we had lately quitted, and after a time directed my  steps that way.
 I passed and repassed the house, and stopped and  listened at the door; all was dark, and silent as the grave.
    Yet I lingered about, and could not tear myself away, thinking of all  possible harm that might happen to the child--of fires and robberies  and even murder--and feeling as if some evil must ensue if I turned my  back upon the place.
 The closing of a door or window in the street  brought me before the curiosity-dealer's once more; I crossed the road  and looked up at the house to assure myself that the noise had not come  from there.
 No, it was black, cold, and lifeless as before.
    There were few passengers astir; the street was sad and dismal, and  pretty well my own.
 A few stragglers from the theatres hurried by, and  now and then I turned aside to avoid some noisy drunkard as he reeled  homewards, but these interruptions were not frequent and soon ceased.
  The clocks struck one.
 Still I paced up and down, promising myself that  every time should be the last, and breaking faith with myself on some  new plea as often as I did so.
    The more I thought of what the old man had said, and of his looks and  bearing, the less I could account for what I had seen and heard.
 I had  a strong misgiving that his nightly absence was for no good purpose.
 I  had only come to know the fact through the innocence of the child, and  though the old man was by at the time, and saw my undisguised surprise,  he had preserved a strange mystery upon the subject and offered no word  of explanation.
 These reflections naturally recalled again more  strongly than before his haggard face, his wandering manner, his  restless anxious looks.
 His affection for the child might not be  inconsistent with villany of the worst kind; even that very affection  was in itself an extraordinary contradiction, or how could he leave her  thus? Disposed as I was to think badly of him, I never doubted that his  love for her was real.
 I could not admit the thought, remembering what  had passed between us, and the tone of voice in which he had called her  by her name.
    'Stay here of course,' the child had said in answer to my question, 'I  always do!' What could take him from home by night, and every night! I  called up all the strange tales I had ever heard of dark and secret  deeds committed in great towns and escaping detection for a long series  of years; wild as many of these stories were, I could not find one  adapted to this mystery, which only became the more impenetrable, in  proportion as I sought to solve it.
    Occupied with such thoughts as these, and a crowd of others all tending  to the same point, I continued to pace the street for two long hours;  at length the rain began to descend heavily, and then over-powered by  fatigue though no less interested than I had been at first, I engaged  the nearest coach and so got home.
 A cheerful fire was blazing on the  hearth, the lamp burnt brightly, my clock received me with its old  familiar welcome; everything was quiet, warm and cheering, and in happy  contrast to the gloom and darkness I had quitted.
    But all that night, waking or in my sleep, the same thoughts recurred  and the same images retained possession of my brain.
 I had ever before  me the old dark murky rooms--the gaunt suits of mail with their ghostly  silent air--the faces all awry, grinning from wood and stone--the dust  and rust and worm that lives in wood--and alone in the midst of all  this lumber and decay and ugly age, the beautiful child in her gentle  slumber, smiling through her light and sunny dreams.
              After combating, for nearly a week, the feeling which impelled me to  revisit the place I had quitted under the circumstances already  detailed, I yielded to it at length; and determining that this time I  would present myself by the light of day, bent my steps thither early  in the morning.
    I walked past the house, and took several turns in the street, with  that kind of hesitation which is natural to a man who is conscious that  the visit he is about to pay is unexpected, and may not be very  acceptable.
 However, as the door of the shop was shut, and it did not  appear likely that I should be recognized by those within, if I  continued merely to pass up and down before it, I soon conquered this  irresolution, and found myself in the Curiosity Dealer's warehouse.
    The old man and another person were together in the back part, and  there seemed to have been high words between them, for their voices  which were raised to a very high pitch suddenly stopped on my entering,  and the old man advancing hastily towards me, said in a tremulous tone  that he was very glad I had come.
    'You interrupted us at a critical moment,' said he, pointing to the man  whom I had found in company with him; 'this fellow will murder me one  of these days.
 He would have done so, long ago, if he had dared.
'    'Bah! You would swear away my life if you could,' returned the other,  after bestowing a stare and a frown on me; 'we all know that!'    'I almost think I could,' cried the old man, turning feebly upon him.
  'If oaths, or prayers, or words, could rid me of you, they should.
 I  would be quit of you, and would be relieved if you were dead.
'    'I know it,' returned the other.
 'I said so, didn't I? But neither  oaths, or prayers, nor words, WILL kill me, and therefore I live, and  mean to live.
'    'And his mother died!' cried the old man, passionately clasping his  hands and looking upward; 'and this is Heaven's justice!'    The other stood lounging with his foot upon a chair, and regarded him  with a contemptuous sneer.
 He was a young man of one-and-twenty or  thereabouts; well made, and certainly handsome, though the expression  of his face was far from prepossessing, having in common with his  manner and even his dress, a dissipated, insolent air which repelled  one.
    'Justice or no justice,' said the young fellow, 'here I am and here I  shall stop till such time as I think fit to go, unless you send for  assistance to put me out--which you won't do, I know.
 I tell you again  that I want to see my sister.
'    'YOUR sister!' said the old man bitterly.
    'Ah! You can't change the relationship,' returned the other.
 'If you  could, you'd have done it long ago.
 I want to see my sister, that you  keep cooped up here, poisoning her mind with your sly secrets and  pretending an affection for her that you may work her to death, and add  a few scraped shillings every week to the money you can hardly count.
 I  want to see her; and I will.
'    'Here's a moralist to talk of poisoned minds! Here's a generous spirit  to scorn scraped-up shillings!' cried the old man, turning from him to  me.
 'A profligate, sir, who has forfeited every claim not only upon  those who have the misfortune to be of his blood, but upon society  which knows nothing of him but his misdeeds.
 A liar too,' he added, in  a lower voice as he drew closer to me, 'who knows how dear she is to  me, and seeks to wound me even there, because there is a stranger  nearby.
'    'Strangers are nothing to me, grandfather,' said the young fellow  catching at the word, 'nor I to them, I hope.
 The best they can do, is  to keep an eye to their business and leave me to mine.
 There's a friend  of mine waiting outside, and as it seems that I may have to wait some  time, I'll call him in, with your leave.
'    Saying this, he stepped to the door, and looking down the street  beckoned several times to some unseen person, who, to judge from the  air of impatience with which these signals were accompanied, required a  great quantity of persuasion to induce him to advance.
 At length there  sauntered up, on the opposite side of the way--with a bad pretense of  passing by accident--a figure conspicuous for its dirty smartness,  which after a great many frowns and jerks of the head, in resistance of  the invitation, ultimately crossed the road and was brought into the  shop.
    'There.
 It's Dick Swiveller,' said the young fellow, pushing him in.
  'Sit down, Swiveller.
'    'But is the old min agreeable?' said Mr Swiveller in an undertone.
    Mr Swiveller complied, and looking about him with a propitiatory smile,  observed that last week was a fine week for the ducks, and this week  was a fine week for the dust; he also observed that whilst standing by  the post at the street-corner, he had observed a pig with a straw in  his mouth issuing out of the tobacco-shop, from which appearance he  augured that another fine week for the ducks was approaching, and that  rain would certainly ensue.
 He furthermore took occasion to apologize  for any negligence that might be perceptible in his dress, on the  ground that last night he had had 'the sun very strong in his eyes'; by  which expression he was understood to convey to his hearers in the most  delicate manner possible, the information that he had been extremely  drunk.
    'But what,' said Mr Swiveller with a sigh, 'what is the odds so long as  the fire of soul is kindled at the taper of conwiviality, and the wing  of friendship never moults a feather! What is the odds so long as the  spirit is expanded by means of rosy wine, and the present moment is the  least happiest of our existence!'    'You needn't act the chairman here,' said his friend, half aside.
    'Fred!' cried Mr Swiveller, tapping his nose, 'a word to the wise is  sufficient for them--we may be good and happy without riches, Fred.
  Say not another syllable.
 I know my cue; smart is the word.
 Only one  little whisper, Fred--is the old min friendly?'    'Never you mind,' replied his friend.
    'Right again, quite right,' said Mr Swiveller, 'caution is the word,  and caution is the act.
' with that, he winked as if in preservation of  some deep secret, and folding his arms and leaning back in his chair,  looked up at the ceiling with profound gravity.
    It was perhaps not very unreasonable to suspect from what had already  passed, that Mr Swiveller was not quite recovered from the effects of  the powerful sunlight to which he had made allusion; but if no such  suspicion had been awakened by his speech, his wiry hair, dull eyes,  and sallow face would still have been strong witnesses against him.
 His  attire was not, as he had himself hinted, remarkable for the  nicest  arrangement, but was in a state of disorder which strongly induced the  idea that he had gone to bed in it.
 It consisted of a brown body-coat  with a great many brass buttons up the front and only one behind, a  bright check neckerchief, a plaid waistcoat, soiled white trousers, and  a very limp hat, worn with the wrong side foremost, to hide a hole in  the brim.
 The breast of his coat was ornamented with an outside pocket  from which there peeped forth the cleanest end of a very large and very  ill-favoured handkerchief; his dirty wristbands were pulled on as far  as possible and ostentatiously folded back over his cuffs; he displayed  no gloves, and carried a yellow cane having at the top a bone hand with  the semblance of a ring on its little finger and a black ball in its  grasp.
 With all these personal advantages (to which may be added a  strong savour of tobacco-smoke, and a prevailing greasiness of  appearance) Mr Swiveller leant back in his chair with his eyes fixed on  the ceiling, and occasionally pitching his voice to the needful key,  obliged the company with a few bars of an intensely dismal air, and  then, in the middle of a note, relapsed into his former silence.
    The old man sat himself down in a chair, and with folded hands, looked  sometimes at his grandson and sometimes at his strange companion, as if  he were utterly powerless and had no resource but to leave them to do  as they pleased.
 The young man reclined against a table at no great  distance from his friend, in apparent indifference to everything that  had passed; and I--who felt the difficulty of any interference,  notwithstanding that the old man had appealed to me, both by words and  looks--made the best feint I could of being occupied in examining some  of the goods that were disposed for sale, and paying very little  attention to a person before me.
    The silence was not of long duration, for Mr Swiveller, after favouring  us with several melodious assurances that his heart was in the  Highlands, and that he wanted but his Arab steed as a preliminary to  the achievement of great feats of valour and loyalty, removed his eyes  from the ceiling and subsided into prose again.
    'Fred,' said Mr Swiveller stopping short, as if the idea had suddenly  occurred to him, and speaking in the same audible whisper as before,  'is the old min friendly?'    'What does it matter?' returned his friend peevishly.
    'No, but IS he?' said Dick.
    'Yes, of course.
 What do I care whether he is or not?'    Emboldened as it seemed by this reply to enter into a more general  conversation, Mr Swiveller plainly laid himself out to captivate our  attention.
    He began by remarking that soda-water, though a good thing in the  abstract, was apt to lie cold upon the stomach unless qualified with  ginger, or a small infusion of brandy, which latter article he held to  be preferable in all cases, saving for the one consideration of  expense.
 Nobody venturing to dispute these positions, he proceeded to  observe that the human hair was a great retainer of tobacco-smoke, and  that the young gentlemen of Westminster and Eton, after eating vast  quantities of apples to conceal any scent of cigars from their anxious  friends, were usually detected in consequence of their heads possessing  this remarkable property; when he concluded that if the Royal Society  would turn their attention to the circumstance, and endeavour to find  in the resources of science a means of preventing such untoward  revelations, they might indeed be looked upon as benefactors to  mankind.
 These opinions being equally incontrovertible with those he  had already pronounced, he went on to inform us that Jamaica rum,  though unquestionably an agreeable spirit of great richness and  flavour, had the drawback of remaining constantly present to the taste  next day; and nobody being venturous enough to argue this point either,  he increased in confidence and became yet more companionable and  communicative.
    'It's a devil of a thing, gentlemen,' said Mr Swiveller, 'when  relations fall out and disagree.
 If the wing of friendship should never  moult a feather, the wing of relationship should never be clipped, but  be always expanded and serene.
 Why should a grandson and grandfather  peg away at each other with mutual wiolence when all might be bliss and  concord.
 Why not jine hands and forgit it?'    'Hold your tongue,' said his friend.
    'Sir,' replied Mr Swiveller, 'don't you interrupt the chair.
  Gentlemen, how does the case stand, upon the present occasion?  Here is  a jolly old grandfather--I say it with the utmost respect--and here is  a wild, young grandson.
 The jolly old grandfather says to the wild  young grandson, "I have brought you up and educated you, Fred; I have  put you in the way of getting on in life; you have bolted a little out  of course, as young fellows often do; and you shall never have another  chance, nor the ghost of half a one.
"  The wild young grandson makes  answer to this and says, "You're as rich as rich can be; you have been  at no uncommon expense on my account, you're saving up piles of money  for my little sister that lives with you in a secret, stealthy,  hugger-muggering kind of way and with no manner of enjoyment--why can't  you stand a trifle for your grown-up relation?" The jolly old  grandfather unto this, retorts, not only that he declines to fork out  with that cheerful readiness which is always so agreeable and pleasant  in a gentleman of his time of life, but that he will bow up, and call  names, and make reflections whenever they meet.
 Then the plain question  is, an't it a pity that this state of things should continue, and how  much better would it be for the gentleman to hand over a reasonable  amount of tin, and make it all right and comfortable?'    Having delivered this oration with a great many waves and flourishes of  the hand, Mr Swiveller abruptly thrust the head of his cane into his  mouth as if to prevent himself from impairing the effect of his speech  by adding one other word.
    'Why do you hunt and persecute me, God help me!' said the old man  turning to his grandson.
 'Why do you bring your prolifigate companions  here? How often am I to tell you that my life is one of care and  self-denial, and that I am poor?'    'How often am I to tell you,' returned the other, looking coldly at  him, 'that I know better?'    'You have chosen your own path,' said the old man.
 'Follow it.
  Leave  Nell and me to toil and work.
'    'Nell will be a woman soon,' returned the other, 'and, bred in your  faith, she'll forget her brother unless he shows himself sometimes.
'    'Take care,' said the old man with sparkling eyes, 'that she does not  forget you when you would have her memory keenest.
 Take care that the  day don't come when you walk barefoot in the streets, and she rides by  in a gay carriage of her own.
'    'You mean when she has your money?' retorted the other.
 'How like a  poor man he talks!'    'And yet,' said the old man dropping his voice and speaking like one  who thinks aloud, 'how poor we are, and what a life it is! The cause is  a young child's guiltless of all harm or wrong, but nothing goes well  with it! Hope and patience, hope and patience!'    These words were uttered in too low a tone to reach the ears of the  young men.
  Mr Swiveller appeared to think that they implied some mental  struggle consequent upon the powerful effect of his address, for he  poked his friend with his cane and whispered his conviction that he had  administered 'a clincher,' and that he expected a commission on the  profits.
 Discovering his mistake after a while, he appeared to grow  rather sleepy and discontented, and had more than once suggested the  propriety of an immediate departure, when the door opened, and the  child herself appeared.
              The child was closely followed by an elderly man of remarkably hard  features and forbidding aspect, and so low in stature as to be quite a  dwarf, though his head and face were large enough for the body of a  giant.
 His black eyes were restless, sly, and cunning; his mouth and  chin, bristly with the stubble of a coarse hard beard; and his  complexion was one of that kind which never looks clean or wholesome.
  But what added most to the grotesque expression of his face was a  ghastly smile, which, appearing to be the mere result of habit and to  have no connection with any mirthful or complacent feeling, constantly  revealed the few discoloured fangs that were yet scattered in his  mouth, and gave him the aspect of a panting dog.
 His dress consisted of  a large high-crowned hat, a worn dark suit, a pair of capacious shoes,  and a dirty white neckerchief sufficiently limp and crumpled to  disclose the greater portion of his wiry throat.
 Such hair as he had  was of a grizzled black, cut short and straight upon his temples, and  hanging in a frowzy fringe about his ears.
 His hands, which were of a  rough, coarse grain, were very dirty; his fingernails were crooked,  long, and yellow.
    There was ample time to note these particulars, for besides that they  were sufficiently obvious without very close observation, some moments  elapsed before any one broke silence.
 The child advanced timidly  towards her brother and put her hand in his, the dwarf (if we may call  him so) glanced keenly at all present, and the curiosity-dealer, who  plainly had not expected his uncouth visitor, seemed disconcerted and  embarrassed.
    'Ah!' said the dwarf, who with his hand stretched out above his eyes  had been surveying the young man attentively, 'that should be your  grandson, neighbour!'    'Say rather that he should not be,' replied the old man.
 'But he is.
'    'And that?' said the dwarf, pointing to Dick Swiveller.
    'Some friend of his, as welcome here as he,' said the old man.
    'And that?' inquired the dwarf, wheeling round and pointing straight at  me.
    'A gentleman who was so good as to bring Nell home the other night when  she lost her way, coming from your house.
'    The little man turned to the child as if to chide her or express his  wonder, but as she was talking to the young man, held his peace, and  bent his head to listen.
    'Well, Nelly,' said the young fellow aloud.
 'Do they teach you to hate  me, eh?'    'No, no.
 For shame.
 Oh, no!' cried the child.
    'To love me, perhaps?' pursued her brother with a sneer.
    'To do neither,' she returned.
 'They never speak to me about you.
  Indeed they never do.
'    'I dare be bound for that,' he said, darting a bitter look at the  grandfather.
 'I dare be bound for that Nell.
 Oh! I believe you there!'    'But I love you dearly, Fred,' said the child.
    'No doubt!'    'I do indeed, and always will,' the child repeated with great emotion,  'but oh! If you would leave off vexing him and making him unhappy, then  I could love you more.
'    'I see!' said the young man, as he stooped carelessly over the child,  and having kissed her, pushed her from him: 'There--get you away now  you have said your lesson.
 You needn't whimper.
 We part good friends  enough, if that's the matter.
'    He remained silent, following her with his eyes, until she had gained  her little room and closed the door; and then turning to the dwarf,  said abruptly,    'Harkee, Mr--'    'Meaning me?' returned the dwarf.
 'Quilp is my name.
 You might  remember.
 It's not a long one--Daniel Quilp.
'    'Harkee, Mr Quilp, then,' pursued the other, 'You have some influence  with my grandfather there.
'    'Some,' said Mr Quilp emphatically.
    'And are in a few of his mysteries and secrets.
'    'A few,' replied Quilp, with equal dryness.
    'Then let me tell him once for all, through you, that I will come into  and go out of this place as often as I like, so long as he keeps Nell  here; and that if he wants to be quit of me, he must first be quit of  her.
 What have I done to be made a bugbear of, and to be shunned and  dreaded as if I brought the plague? He'll tell you that I have no  natural affection; and that I care no more for Nell, for her own sake,  than I do for him.
 Let him say so.
 I care for the whim, then, of coming  to and fro and reminding her of my existence.
 I WILL see her when I  please.
 That's my point.
 I came here to-day to maintain it, and I'll  come here again fifty times with the same object and always with the  same success.
 I said I would stop till I had gained it.
  I have done  so, and now my visit's ended.
 Come Dick.
'    'Stop!' cried Mr Swiveller, as his companion turned toward the door.
  'Sir!'    'Sir, I am your humble servant,' said Mr Quilp, to whom the  monosyllable was addressed.
    'Before I leave the gay and festive scene, and halls of dazzling light,  sir,' said Mr Swiveller, 'I will with your permission, attempt a slight  remark.
 I came here, sir, this day, under the impression that the old  min was friendly.
'    'Proceed, sir,' said Daniel Quilp; for the orator had made a sudden  stop.
    'Inspired by this idea and the sentiments it awakened, sir, and feeling  as a mutual friend that badgering, baiting, and bullying, was not the  sort of thing calculated to expand the souls and promote the social  harmony of the contending parties, I took upon myself to suggest a  course which is THE course to be adopted to the present occasion.
  Will  you allow me to whisper half a syllable, sir?'    Without waiting for the permission he sought, Mr Swiveller stepped up  to the dwarf, and leaning on his shoulder and stooping down to get at  his ear, said in a voice which was perfectly audible to all present,    'The watch-word to the old min is--fork.
'    'Is what?' demanded Quilp.
    'Is fork, sir, fork,' replied Mr Swiveller slapping his pocket.
 'You  are awake, sir?'    The dwarf nodded.
 Mr Swiveller drew back and nodded likewise, then drew  a little further back and nodded again, and so on.
 By these means he in  time reached the door, where he gave a great cough to attract the  dwarf's attention and gain an opportunity of expressing in dumb show,  the closest confidence and most inviolable secrecy.
  Having performed  the serious pantomime that was necessary for the due conveyance of  these idea, he cast himself upon his friend's track, and vanished.
    'Humph!' said the dwarf with a sour look and a shrug of his shoulders,  'so much for dear relations.
 Thank God I acknowledge none! Nor need you  either,' he added, turning to the old man, 'if you were not as weak as  a reed, and nearly as senseless.
'    'What would you have me do?' he retorted in a kind of helpless  desperation.
 'It is easy to talk and sneer.
 What would you have me do?'    'What would I do if I was in your case?' said the dwarf.
    'Something violent, no doubt.
'    'You're right there,' returned the little man, highly gratified by the  compliment, for such he evidently considered it; and grinning like a  devil as he rubbed his dirty hands together.
 'Ask Mrs Quilp, pretty Mrs  Quilp, obedient, timid, loving Mrs Quilp.
 But that reminds me--I have  left her all alone, and she will be anxious and know not a moment's  peace till I return.
 I know she's always in that condition when I'm  away, thought she doesn't dare to say so, unless I lead her on and tell  her she may speak freely and I won't be angry with her.
  Oh!  well-trained Mrs Quilp.
'    The creature appeared quite horrible with his monstrous head and little  body, as he rubbed his hands slowly round, and round, and round  again--with something fantastic even in his manner of performing this  slight action--and, dropping his shaggy brows and cocking his chin in  the air, glanced upward with a stealthy look of exultation that an imp  might have copied and appropriated to himself.
    'Here,' he said, putting his hand into his breast and sidling up to the  old man as he spoke; 'I brought it myself for fear of accidents, as,  being in gold, it was something large and heavy for Nell to carry in  her bag.
 She need be accustomed to such loads betimes though,  neighbor, for she will carry weight when you are dead.
'    'Heaven send she may! I hope so,' said the old man with something like  a groan.
    'Hope so!' echoed the dwarf, approaching close to his ear; 'neighbour,  I would I knew in what good investment all these supplies are sunk.
 But  you are a deep man, and keep your secret close.
'    'My secret!' said the other with a haggard look.
 'Yes, you're  right--I--I--keep it close--very close.
'    He said no more, but taking the money turned away with a slow,  uncertain step, and pressed his hand upon his head like a weary and  dejected man.
 The dwarf watched him sharply, while he passed into the  little sitting-room and locked it in an iron safe above the  chimney-piece; and after musing for a short space, prepared to take his  leave, observing that unless he made good haste, Mrs Quilp would  certainly be in fits on his return.
    'And so, neighbour,' he added, 'I'll turn my face homewards, leaving my  love for Nelly and hoping she may never lose her way again, though her  doing so HAS procured me an honour I didn't expect.
' With that he bowed  and leered at me, and with a keen glance around which seemed to  comprehend every object within his range of vision, however, small or  trivial, went his way.
    I had several times essayed to go myself, but the old man had always  opposed it and entreated me to remain.
 As he renewed his entreaties on  our being left along, and adverted with many thanks to the former  occasion of our being together, I willingly yielded to his persuasions,  and sat down, pretending to examine some curious miniatures and a few  old medals which he placed before me.
 It needed no great pressing to  induce me to stay, for if my curiosity has been excited on the occasion  of my first visit, it certainly was not diminished now.
    Nell joined us before long, and bringing some needle-work to the table,  sat by the old man's side.
 It was pleasant to observe the fresh flowers  in the room, the pet bird with a green bough shading his little cage,  the breath of freshness and youth which seemed to rustle through the  old dull house and hover round the child.
 It was curious, but not so  pleasant, to turn from the beauty and grace of the girl, to the  stooping figure, care-worn face, and jaded aspect of the old man.
  As  he grew weaker and more feeble, what would become of this lonely little  creature; poor protector as he was, say that he died--what would be her  fate, then?    The old man almost answered my thoughts, as he laid his hand on hers,  and spoke aloud.
    'I'll be of better cheer, Nell,' he said; 'there must be good fortune  in store for thee--I do not ask it for myself, but thee.
 Such miseries  must fall on thy innocent head without it, that I cannot believe but  that, being tempted, it will come at last!'    She looked cheerfully into his face, but made no answer.
    'When I think,' said he, 'of the many years--many in thy short  life--that thou has lived with me; of my monotonous existence, knowing  no companions of thy own age nor any childish pleasures; of the  solitude in which thou has grown to be what thou art, and in which thou  hast lived apart from nearly all thy kind but one old man; I sometimes  fear I have dealt hardly by thee, Nell.
'    'Grandfather!' cried the child in unfeigned surprise.
    'Not in intention--no no,' said he.
 'I have ever looked forward to the  time that should enable thee to mix among the gayest and prettiest, and  take thy station with the best.
 But I still look forward, Nell, I still  look forward, and if I should be forced to leave thee, meanwhile, how  have I fitted thee for struggles with the world? The poor bird yonder  is as well qualified to encounter it, and be turned adrift upon its  mercies--Hark! I hear Kit outside.
 Go to him, Nell, go to him.
'    She rose, and hurrying away, stopped, turned back, and put her arms  about the old man's neck, then left him and hurried away again--but  faster this time, to hide her falling tears.
    'A word in your ear, sir,' said the old man in a hurried whisper.
 'I  have been rendered uneasy by what you said the other night, and can  only plead that I have done all for the best--that it is too late to  retract, if I could (though I cannot)--and that I hope to triumph yet.
  All is for her sake.
 I have borne great poverty myself, and would spare  her the sufferings that poverty carries with it.
 I would spare her the  miseries that brought her mother, my own dear child, to an early grave.
  I would leave her--not with resources which could be easily spent or  squandered away, but with what would place her beyond the reach of want  for ever.
 You mark me sir? She shall have no pittance, but a  fortune--Hush! I can say no more than that, now or at any other time,  and she is here again!'    The eagerness with which all this was poured into my ear, the trembling  of the hand with which he clasped my arm, the strained and starting  eyes he fixed upon me, the wild vehemence and agitation of his manner,  filled me with amazement.
 All that I had heard and seen, and a great  part of what he had said himself, led me to suppose that he was a  wealthy man.
 I could form no comprehension of his character, unless he  were one of those miserable wretches who, having made gain the sole end  and object of their lives and having succeeded in amassing great  riches, are constantly tortured by the dread of poverty, and beset by  fears of loss and ruin.
 Many things he had said which I had been at a  loss to understand, were quite reconcilable with the idea thus  presented to me, and at length I concluded that beyond all doubt he was  one of this unhappy race.
    The opinion was not the result of hasty consideration, for which indeed  there was no opportunity at that time, as the child came directly, and  soon occupied herself in preparations for giving Kit a writing lesson,  of which it seemed he had a couple every week, and one regularly on  that evening, to the great mirth and enjoyment both of himself and his  instructress.
 To relate how it was a long time before his modesty could  be so far prevailed upon as it admit of his sitting down in the  parlour, in the presence of an unknown gentleman--how, when he did set  down, he tucked up his sleeves and squared his elbows and put his face  close to the copy-book and squinted horribly at the lines--how, from  the very first moment of having the pen in his hand, he began to wallow  in blots, and to daub himself with ink up to the very roots of his  hair--how, if he did by accident form a letter properly, he immediately  smeared it out again with his arm in his preparations to make  another--how, at every fresh mistake, there was a fresh burst of  merriment from the child and louder and not less hearty laugh from poor  Kit himself--and how there was all the way through, notwithstanding, a  gentle wish on her part to teach, and an anxious desire on his to  learn--to relate all these particulars would no doubt occupy more space  and time than they deserve.
 It will be sufficient to say that the  lesson was given--that evening passed and night came on--that the old  man again grew restless and impatient--that he quitted the house  secretly at the same hour as before--and that the child was once more  left alone within its gloomy walls.
    And now that I have carried this history so far in my own character and  introduced these personages to the reader, I shall for the convenience  of the narrative detach myself from its further course, and leave those  who have prominent and necessary parts in it to speak and act for  themselves.
              Mr and Mrs Quilp resided on Tower Hill; and in her bower on Tower Hill  Mrs Quilp was left to pine the absence of her lord, when he quitted her  on the business which he had already seen to transact.
    Mr Quilp could scarcely be said to be of any particular trade or  calling, though his pursuits were diversified and his occupations  numerous.
 He collected the rents of whole colonies of filthy streets  and alleys by the waterside, advanced money to the seamen and petty  officers of merchant vessels, had a share in the ventures of divers  mates of East Indiamen, smoked his smuggled cigars under the very nose  of the Custom House, and made appointments on 'Change with men in  glazed hats and round jackets pretty well every day.
 On the Surrey side  of the river was a small rat-infested dreary yard called 'Quilp's  Wharf,' in which were a little wooden counting-house burrowing all awry  in the dust as if it had fallen from the clouds and ploughed into the  ground; a few fragments of rusty anchors; several large iron rings;  some piles of rotten wood; and two or three heaps of old sheet copper,  crumpled, cracked, and battered.
 On Quilp's Wharf, Daniel Quilp was a  ship-breaker, yet to judge from these appearances he must either have  been a ship-breaker on a very small scale, or have broken his ships up  very small indeed.
 Neither did the place present any extraordinary  aspect of life or activity, as its only human occupant was an  amphibious boy in a canvas suit, whose sole change of occupation was  from sitting on the head of a pile and throwing stones into the mud  when the tide was out, to standing with his hands in his pockets gazing  listlessly on the motion and on the bustle of the river at high-water.
    The dwarf's lodging on Tower hill comprised, besides the needful  accommodation for himself and Mrs Quilp, a small sleeping-closet for  that lady's mother, who resided with the couple and waged perpetual war  with Daniel; of whom, notwithstanding, she stood in no slight dread.
  Indeed, the ugly creature contrived by some means or other--whether by  his ugliness or his ferocity or his natural cunning is no great  matter--to impress with a wholesome fear of his anger, most of those  with whom he was brought into daily contact and communication.
 Over  nobody had he such complete ascendance as Mrs Quilp herself--a pretty  little, mild-spoken, blue-eyed woman, who having allied herself in  wedlock to the dwarf in one of those strange infatuations of which  examples are by no means scarce, performed a sound practical penance  for her folly, every day of her life.
    It has been said that Mrs Quilp was pining in her bower.
 In her bower  she was, but not alone, for besides the old lady her mother of whom  mention has recently been made, there were present some half-dozen  ladies of the neighborhood who had happened by a strange accident (and  also by a little understanding among themselves) to drop in one after  another, just about tea-time.
 This being a season favourable to  conversation, and the room being a cool, shady, lazy kind of place,  with some plants at the open window shutting out the dust, and  interposing pleasantly enough between the tea table within and the old  Tower without, it is no wonder that the ladies felt an inclination to  talk and linger, especially when there are taken into account the  additional inducements of fresh butter, new bread, shrimps, and  watercresses.
    Now, the ladies being together under these circumstances, it was  extremely natural that the discourse should turn upon the propensity of  mankind to tyrannize over the weaker sex, and the duty that developed  upon the weaker sex to resist that tyranny and assert their rights and  dignity.
 It was natural for four reasons: firstly, because Mrs Quilp  being a young woman and notoriously under the dominion of her husband  ought to be excited to rebel; secondly, because Mrs Quilp's parent was  known to be laudably shrewish in her disposition and inclined to resist  male authority; thirdly, because each visitor wished to show for  herself how superior she was in this respect to the generality of her  sex; and fourthly, because the company being accustomed to scandalise  each other in pairs, were deprived of their usual subject of  conversation now that they were all assembled in close friendship, and  had consequently no better employment than to attack the common enemy.
    Moved by these considerations, a stout lady opened the proceedings by  inquiring, with an air of great concern and sympathy, how Mr Quilp was;  whereunto Mr Quilp's wife's mother replied sharply, 'Oh! He was well  enough--nothing much was every the matter with him--and ill weeds were  sure to thrive.
' All the ladies then sighed in concert, shook their  heads gravely, and looked at Mrs Quilp as a martyr.
    'Ah!' said the spokeswoman, 'I wish you'd give her a little of your  advice, Mrs Jiniwin'--Mrs Quilp had been a Miss Jiniwin it should be  observed--'nobody knows better than you, ma'am, what us women owe to  ourselves.
'    'Owe indeed, ma'am!' replied Mrs Jiniwin.
 'When my poor husband, her  dear father, was alive, if he had ever ventured a cross word to me, I'd  have--' The good old lady did not finish the sentence, but she twisted  off the head of a shrimp with a vindictiveness which seemed to imply  that the action was in some degree a substitute for words.
 In this  light it was clearly understood by the other party, who immediately  replied with great approbation, 'You quite enter into my feelings,  ma'am, and it's jist what I'd do myself.
'    'But you have no call to do it,' said Mrs Jiniwin.
 'Luckily for you,  you have no more occasion to do it than I had.
'    'No woman need have, if she was true to herself,' rejoined the stout  lady.
    'Do you hear that, Betsy?' said Mrs Jiniwin, in a warning voice.
  'How  often have I said the same words to you, and almost gone down my knees  when I spoke 'em!'    Poor Mrs Quilp, who had looked in a state of helplessness from one face  of condolence to another, coloured, smiled, and shook her head  doubtfully.
 This was the signal for a general clamour, which beginning  in a low murmur gradually swelled into a great noise in which everybody  spoke at once, and all said that she being a young woman had no right  to set up her opinions against the experiences of those who knew so  much better; that it was very wrong of her not to take the advice of  people who had nothing at heart but her good; that it was next door to  being downright ungrateful to conduct herself in that manner; that if  she had no respect for herself she ought to have some for other women,  all of whom she compromised by her meekness; and that if she had no  respect for other women, the time would come when other women would  have no respect for her; and she would be very sorry for that, they  could tell her.
 Having dealt out these admonitions, the ladies fell to  a more powerful assault than they had yet made upon the  mixed tea, new  bread, fresh butter, shrimps, and watercresses, and said that their  vexation was so great to see her going on like that, that they could  hardly bring themselves to eat a single morsel.
    It's all very fine to talk,' said Mrs Quilp with much simplicity, 'but  I know that if I was to die to-morrow, Quilp could marry anybody he  pleased--now that he could, I know!'    There was quite a scream of indignation at this idea.
 Marry whom he  pleased! They would like to see him dare to think of marrying any of  them; they would like to see the faintest approach to such a thing.
  One lady (a widow) was quite certain she should stab him if he hinted  at it.
    'Very well,' said Mrs Quilp, nodding her head, 'as I said just now,  it's very easy to talk, but I say again that I know--that I'm  sure--Quilp has such a way with him when he likes, that the best  looking woman here couldn't refuse him if I was dead, and she was free,  and he chose to make love to her.
 Come!'    Everybody bridled up at this remark, as much as to say, 'I know you  mean me.
 Let him try--that's all.
' and yet for some hidden reason they  were all angry with the widow, and each lady whispered in her  neighbour's ear that it was very plain that said widow thought herself  the person referred to, and what a puss she was!    'Mother knows,' said Mrs Quilp, 'that what I say is quite correct, for  she often said so before we were married.
 Didn't you say so, mother?'    This inquiry involved the respected lady in rather a delicate position,  for she certainly had been an active party in making her daughter Mrs  Quilp, and, besides, it was not supporting the family credit to  encourage the idea that she had married a man whom nobody else would  have.
 On the other hand, to exaggerate the captivating qualities of her  son-in-law would be to weaken the cause of revolt, in which all her  energies were deeply engaged.
 Beset by these opposing considerations,  Mrs Jiniwin admitted the powers of insinuation, but denied the right to  govern, and with a timely compliment to the stout lady brought back the  discussion to the point from which it had strayed.
    'Oh! It's a sensible and proper thing indeed, what Mrs George has  said!' exclaimed the old lady.
 'If women are only true to  themselves!--But Betsy isn't, and more's the shame and pity.
'    'Before I'd let a man order me about as Quilp orders her,' said Mrs  George, 'before I'd consent to stand in awe of a man as she does of  him, I'd--I'd kill myself, and write a letter first to say he did it!'    This remark being loudly commended and approved of, another lady (from  the Minories) put in her word:    'Mr Quilp may be a very nice man,' said this lady, 'and I supposed  there's no doubt he is, because Mrs Quilp says he is, and Mrs Jiniwin  says he is, and they ought to know, or nobody does.
 But still he is not  quite a--what one calls a handsome man, nor quite a young man neither,  which might be a little excuse for him if anything could be; whereas  his wife is young, and is good-looking, and is a woman--which is the  greatest thing after all.
'    This last clause being delivered with extraordinary pathos, elicited a  corresponding murmer from the hearers, stimulated by which the lady  went on to remark that if such a husband was cross and unreasonable  with such a wife, then--    'If he is!' interposed the mother, putting down her tea-cup and  brushing the crumbs out of her lap, preparatory to making a solemn  declaration.
 'If he is! He is the greatest tyrant that every lived, she  daren't call her soul her own, he makes her tremble with a word and  even with a look, he frightens her to death, and she hasn't the spirit  to give him a word back, no, not a single word.
'    Notwithstanding that the fact had been notorious beforehand to all the  tea-drinkers, and had been discussed and expatiated on at every  tea-drinking in the neighbourhood for the last twelve months, this  official communication was no sooner made than they all began to talk  at once and to vie with each other in vehemence and volubility.
  Mrs  George remarked that people would talk, that people had often said this  to her before, that Mrs Simmons then and there present had told her so  twenty times, that she had always said, 'No, Henrietta Simmons, unless  I see it with my own eyes and hear it with my own ears, I never will  believe it.
' Mrs Simmons corroborated this testimony and added strong  evidence of her own.
 The lady from the Minories recounted a successful  course of treatment under which she had placed her own husband, who,  from manifesting one month after marriage unequivocal symptoms of the  tiger, had by this means become subdued into a perfect lamb.
 Another  lady recounted her own personal struggle and final triumph, in the  course whereof she had found it necessary to call in her mother and two  aunts, and to weep incessantly night and day for six weeks.
 A third,  who in the general confusion could secure no other listener, fastened  herself upon a young woman still unmarried who happened to be amongst  them, and conjured her, as she valued her own peace of mind and  happiness to profit by this solemn occasion, to take example from the  weakness of Mrs Quilp, and from that time forth to direct her whole  thoughts to taming and subduing the rebellious spirit of man.
 The noise  was at its height, and half the company had elevated their voices into  a perfect shriek in order to drown the voices of the other half, when  Mrs Jiniwin was seen to change colour and shake her forefinger  stealthily, as if exhorting them to silence.
 Then, and not until then,  Daniel Quilp himself, the cause and occasion of all this clamour, was  observed to be in the room, looking on and listening with profound  attention.
    'Go on, ladies, go on,' said Daniel.
 'Mrs Quilp, pray ask the ladies to  stop to supper, and have a couple of lobsters and something light and  palatable.
'    'I--I--didn't ask them to tea, Quilp,' stammered his wife.
 'It's quite  an accident.
'    'So much the better, Mrs Quilp; these accidental parties are always the  pleasantest,' said the dwarf, rubbing his hands so hard that he seemed  to be engaged in manufacturing, of the dirt with which they were  encrusted, little charges for popguns.
 'What! Not going, ladies, you  are not going, surely!'    His fair enemies tossed their heads slightly as they sought their  respective bonnets and shawls, but left all verbal contention to Mrs  Jiniwin, who finding herself in the position of champion, made a faint  struggle to sustain the character.
    'And why not stop to supper, Quilp,' said the old lady, 'if my daughter  had a mind?'    'To be sure,' rejoined Daniel.
 'Why not?'    'There's nothing dishonest or wrong in a supper, I hope?' said Mrs  Jiniwin.
    'Surely not,' returned the dwarf.
 'Why should there be? Nor anything  unwholesome, either, unless there's lobster-salad or prawns, which I'm  told are not good for digestion.
'    'And you wouldn't like your wife to be attacked with that, or anything  else that would make her uneasy would you?' said Mrs Jiniwin.
    'Not for a score of worlds,' replied the dwarf with a grin.
 'Not even  to have a score of mothers-in-law at the same time--and what a blessing  that would be!'    'My daughter's your wife, Mr Quilp, certainly,' said the old lady with  a giggle, meant for satirical and to imply that he needed to be  reminded of the fact; 'your wedded wife.
'    'So she is, certainly.
 So she is,' observed the dwarf.
    'And she has a right to do as she likes, I hope, Quilp,' said the  old lady trembling, partly with anger and partly with a secret fear of  her impish son-in-law.
    'Hope she has!' he replied.
 'Oh! Don't you know she has? Don't you know  she has, Mrs Jiniwin?    'I know she ought to have, Quilp, and would have, if she was of my way  of thinking.
'    'Why an't you of your mother's way of thinking, my dear?' said the  dwarf, turing round and addressing his wife, 'why don't you always  imitate your mother, my dear? She's the ornament of her sex--your  father said so every day of his life.
 I am sure he did.
'    'Her father was a blessed creetur, Quilp, and worthy twenty thousand of  some people,' said Mrs Jiniwin; 'twenty hundred million thousand.
'    'I should like to have known him,' remarked the dwarf.
 'I dare say he  was a blessed creature then; but I'm sure he is now.
 It was a happy  release.
 I believe he had suffered a long time?'    The old lady gave a gasp, but nothing came of it; Quilp resumed, with  the same malice in his eye and the same sarcastic politeness on his  tongue.
    'You look ill, Mrs Jiniwin; I know you have been exciting yourself too  much--talking perhaps, for it is your weakness.
 Go to bed.
 Do go to  bed.
'    'I shall go when I please, Quilp, and not before.
'    'But please to do now.
 Do please to go now,' said the dwarf.
    The old woman looked angrily at him, but retreated as he advanced, and  falling back before him, suffered him to shut the door upon her and  bolt her out among the guests, who were by this time crowding  downstairs.
 Being left along with his wife, who sat trembling in a  corner with her eyes fixed upon the ground, the little man planted  himself before her, and folding his arms looked steadily at her for a  long time without speaking.
    'Mrs Quilp,' he said at last.
    'Yes, Quilp,' she replead meekly.
    Instead of pursuing the theme he had in his mind, Quilp folded his arms  again, and looked at her more sternly than before, while she averted  her eyes and kept them on the ground.
    'Mrs Quilp.
'    'Yes, Quilp.
'    'If ever you listen to these beldames again, I'll bite you.
'    With this laconic threat, which he accompanied with a snarl that gave  him the appearance of being particularly in earnest, Mr Quilp bade her  clear the teaboard away, and bring the rum.
 The spirit being set before  him in a huge case-bottle, which had originally come out of some ship's  locker, he settled himself in an arm-chair with his large head and face  squeezed up against the back, and his little legs planted on the table.
    'Now, Mrs Quilp,' he said; 'I feel in a smoking humour, and shall  probably blaze away all night.
 But sit where you are, if you please, in  case I want you.
'    His wife returned no other reply than the necessary 'Yes, Quilp,' and  the small lord of the creation took his first cigar and mixed his first  glass of grog.
 The sun went down and the stars peeped out, the Tower  turned from its own proper colours to grey and from grey to black, the  room became perfectly dark and the end of the cigar a deep fiery red,  but still Mr Quilp went on smoking and drinking in the same position,  and staring listlessly out of window with the doglike smile always on  his face, save when Mrs Quilp made some involuntary movement of  restlessness or fatigue; and then it expanded into a grin of delight.
              Whether Mr Quilp took any sleep by snatches of a few winks at a time,  or whether he sat with his eyes wide open all night long, certain it is  that he kept his cigar alight, and kindled every fresh one from the  ashes of that which was nearly consumed, without requiring the  assistance of a candle.
 Nor did the striking of the clocks, hour after  hour, appear to inspire him with any sense of drowsiness or any natural  desire to go to rest, but rather to increase his wakefulness, which he  showed, at every such indication of the progress of the night, by a  suppressed cackling in his throat, and a motion of his shoulders, like  one who laughs heartily but the same time slyly and by stealth.
    At length the day broke, and poor Mrs Quilp, shivering with cold of  early morning and harassed by fatigue and want of sleep, was discovered  sitting patiently on her chair, raising her eyes at intervals in mute  appeal to the compassion and clemency of her lord, and gently reminding  him by an occasion cough that she was still unpardoned and that her  penance had been of long duration.
 But her dwarfish spouse still smoked  his cigar and drank his rum without heeding her; and it was not until  the sun had some time risen, and the activity and noise of city day  were rife in the street, that he deigned to recognize her presence by  any word or sign.
 He might not have done so even then, but for certain  impatient tapping at the door he seemed to denote that some pretty hard  knuckles were actively engaged upon the other side.
    'Why dear me!' he said looking round with a malicious grin, 'it's day.
  Open the door, sweet Mrs Quilp!'    His obedient wife withdrew the bolt, and her lady mother entered.
    Now, Mrs Jiniwin bounced into the room with great impetuosity; for,  supposing her son-in-law to be still a-bed, she had come to relieve her  feelings by pronouncing a strong opinion upon his general conduct and  character.
 Seeing that he was up and dressed, and that the room  appeared to have been occupied ever since she quitted it on the  previous evening, she stopped short, in some embarrassment.
    Nothing escaped the hawk's eye of the ugly little man, who, perfectly  understanding what passed in the old lady's mind, turned uglier still  in the fulness of his satisfaction, and bade her good morning, with a  leer or triumph.
    'Why, Betsy,' said the old woman, 'you haven't been--you don't mean to  say you've been a--'    'Sitting up all night?' said Quilp, supplying the conclusion of the  sentence.
 'Yes she has!'    'All night?' cried Mrs Jiniwin.
    'Ay, all night.
 Is the dear old lady deaf?' said Quilp, with a smile of  which a frown was part.
 'Who says man and wife are bad company?  Ha ha!  The time has flown.
'    'You're a brute!' exclaimed Mrs Jiniwin.
    'Come come,' said Quilp, wilfully misunderstanding her, of course, 'you  mustn't call her names.
 She's married now, you know.
 And though she did  beguile the time and keep me from my bed, you must not be so tenderly  careful of me as to be out of humour with her.
  Bless you for a dear  old lady.
 Here's to your health!'    'I am much obliged to you,' returned the old woman, testifying by a  certain restlessness in her hands a vehement desire to shake her  matronly fist at her son-in-law.
 'Oh! I'm very much obliged to you!'    'Grateful soul!' cried the dwarf.
 'Mrs Quilp.
'    'Yes, Quilp,' said the timid sufferer.
    'Help your mother to get breakfast, Mrs Quilp.
 I am going to the wharf  this morning--the earlier the better, so be quick.
'    Mrs Jiniwin made a faint demonstration of rebellion by sitting down in  a chair near the door and folding her arms as if in a resolute  determination to do nothing.
 But a few whispered words from her  daughter, and a kind inquiry from her son-in-law whether she felt  faint, with a hint that there was abundance of cold water in the next  apartment, routed these symptoms effectually, and she applied herself  to the prescribed preparations with sullen diligence.
    While they were in progress, Mr Quilp withdrew to the adjoining room,  and, turning back his coat-collar, proceeded to smear his countenance  with a damp towel of very unwholesome appearance, which made his  complexion rather more cloudy than it was before.
  But, while he was  thus engaged, his caution and inquisitiveness did not forsake him, for  with a face as sharp and cunning as ever, he often stopped, even in  this short process, and stood listening for any conversation in the  next room, of which he might be the theme.
    'Ah!' he said after a short effort of attention, 'it was not the towel  over my ears, I thought it wasn't.
 I'm a little hunchy villain and a  monster, am I, Mrs Jiniwin? Oh!'    The pleasure of this discovery called up the old doglike smile in full  force.
 When he had quite done with it, he shook himself in a very  doglike manner, and rejoined the ladies.
    Mr Quilp now walked up to front of a looking-glass, and was standing  there putting on his neckerchief, when Mrs Jiniwin happening to be  behind him, could not resist the inclination she felt to shake her fist  at her tyrant son-in-law.
 It was the gesture of an instant, but as she  did so and accompanied the action with a menacing look, she met his eye  in the glass, catching her in the very act.
 The same glance at the  mirror conveyed to her the reflection of a horribly grotesque and  distorted face with the tongue lolling out; and the next instant the  dwarf, turning about with a perfectly bland and placid look, inquired  in a tone of great affection.
    'How are you now, my dear old darling?'    Slight and ridiculous as the incident was, it made him appear such a  little fiend, and withal such a keen and knowing one, that the old  woman felt too much afraid of him to utter a single word, and suffered  herself to be led with extraordinary politeness to the breakfast-table.
  Here he by no means diminished the impression he had just produced, for  he ate hard eggs, shell and all, devoured gigantic prawns with the  heads and tails on, chewed tobacco and water-cresses at the same time  and with extraordinary greediness, drank boiling tea without winking,  bit his fork and spoon till they bent again, and in short performed so  many horrifying and uncommon acts that the women were nearly frightened  out of their wits, and began to doubt if he were really a human  creature.
 At last, having gone through these proceedings and many  others which were equally a part of his system, Mr Quilp left them,  reduced to a very obedient and humbled state, and betook himself to the  river-side, where he took boat for the wharf on which he had bestowed  his name.
    It was flood tide when Daniel Quilp sat himself down in the ferry to  cross to the opposite shore.
 A fleet of barges were coming lazily on,  some sideways, some head first, some stern first; all in a  wrong-headed, dogged, obstinate way, bumping up against the larger  craft, running under the bows of steamboats, getting into every kind of  nook and corner where they had no business, and being crunched on all  sides like so many walnut-shells; while each with its pair of long  sweeps struggling and splashing in the water looked like some lumbering  fish in pain.
 In some of the vessels at anchor all hands were busily  engaged in coiling ropes, spreading out sails to dry, taking in or  discharging their cargoes; in others no life was visible but two or  three tarry boys, and perhaps a barking dog running to and fro upon the  deck or scrambling up to look over the side and bark the louder for the  view.
 Coming slowly on through the forests of masts was a great  steamship, beating the water in short impatient strokes with her heavy  paddles as though she wanted room to breathe, and advancing in her huge  bulk like a sea monster among the minnows of the Thames.
 On either hand  were long black tiers of colliers; between them vessels slowly working  out of harbour with sails glistening in the sun, and creaking noise on  board, re-echoed from a hundred quarters.
 The water and all upon it was  in active motion, dancing and buoyant and bubbling up; while the old  grey Tower and piles of building on the shore, with many a church-spire  shooting up between, looked coldly on, and seemed to disdain their  chafing, restless neighbour.
    Daniel Quilp, who was not much affected by a bright morning save in so  far as it spared him the trouble of carrying an umbrella, caused  himself to be put ashore hard by the wharf, and proceeded thither  through a narrow lane which, partaking of the amphibious character of  its frequenters, had as much water as mud in its composition, and a  very liberal supply of both.
 Arrived at his destination, the first  object that presented itself to his view was a pair of very imperfectly  shod feet elevated in the air with the soles upwards, which remarkable  appearance was referable to the boy, who being of an eccentric spirit  and having a natural taste for tumbling, was now standing on his head  and contemplating the aspect of the river under these uncommon  circumstances.
 He was speedily brought on his heels by the sound of his  master's voice, and as soon as his head was in its right position, Mr  Quilp, to speak expressively in the absence of a better verb, 'punched  it' for him.
    'Come, you let me alone,' said the boy, parrying Quilp's hand with both  his elbows alternatively.
 'You'll get something you won't like if you  don't and so I tell you.
'    'You dog,' snarled Quilp, 'I'll beat you with an iron rod, I'll scratch  you with a rusty nail, I'll pinch your eyes, if you talk to me--I will.
'    With these threats he clenched his hand again, and dexterously diving  in between the elbows and catching the boy's head as it dodged from  side to side, gave it three or four good hard knocks.
 Having now  carried his point and insisted on it, he left off.
    'You won't do it agin,' said the boy, nodding his head and drawing  back, with the elbows ready in case of the worst; 'now--'    'Stand still, you dog,' said Quilp.
 'I won't do it again, because I've  done it as often as I want.
 Here.
 Take the key.
'    'Why don't you hit one of your size?' said the boy approaching very  slowly.
    'Where is there one of my size, you dog?' returned Quilp.
 'Take the  key, or I'll brain you with it'--indeed he gave him a smart tap with  the handle as he spoke.
 'Now, open the counting-house.
'    The boy sulkily complied, muttering at first, but desisting when he  looked round and saw that Quilp was following him with a steady look.
  And here it may be remarked, that between this boy and the dwarf there  existed a strange kind of mutual liking.
 How born or bred, and or  nourished upon blows and threats on one side, and retorts and defiances  on the other, is not to the purpose.
 Quilp would certainly suffer  nobody to contract him but the boy, and the boy would assuredly not  have submitted to be so knocked about by anybody but Quilp, when he had  the power to run away at any time he chose.
    'Now,' said Quilp, passing into the wooden counting-house, 'you mind  the wharf.
 Stand upon your head agin, and I'll cut one of your feet  off.
'    The boy made no answer, but directly Quilp had shut himself in, stood  on his head before the door, then walked on his hands to the back and  stood on his head there, and then to the opposite side and repeated the  performance.
 There were indeed four sides to the counting-house, but he  avoided that one where the window was, deeming it probable that Quilp  would be looking out of it.
 This was prudent, for in point of fact, the  dwarf, knowing his disposition, was lying in wait at a little distance  from the sash armed with a large piece of wood, which, being rough and  jagged and studded in many parts with broken nails, might possibly have  hurt him.
    It was a dirty little box, this counting-house, with nothing in it but  an old ricketty desk and two stools, a hat-peg, an ancient almanack, an  inkstand with no ink, and the stump of one pen, and an eight-day clock  which hadn't gone for eighteen years at least, and of which the  minute-hand had been twisted off for a tooth-pick.
 Daniel Quilp pulled  his hat over his brows, climbed on to the desk (which had a flat top)  and stretching his short length upon it went to sleep with ease of an  old practitioner; intending, no doubt, to compensate himself for the  deprivation of last night's rest, by a long and sound nap.
    Sound it might have been, but long it was not, for he had not been  asleep a quarter of an hour when the boy opened the door and thrust in  his head, which was like a bundle of badly-picked oakum.
 Quilp was a  light sleeper and started up directly.
    'Here's somebody for you,' said the boy.
    'Who?'    'I don't know.
'    'Ask!' said Quilp, seizing the trifle of wood before mentioned and  throwing it at him with such dexterity that it was well the boy  disappeared before it reached the spot on which he had stood.
 'Ask, you  dog.
'    Not caring to venture within range of such missles again, the boy  discreetly sent in his stead the first cause of the interruption, who  now presented herself at the door.
    'What, Nelly!' cried Quilp.
    'Yes,' said the child, hesitating whether to enter or retreat, for the  dwarf just roused, with his dishevelled hair hanging all about him and  a yellow handkerchief over his head, was something fearful to behold;  it's only me, sir.
'    'Come in,' said Quilp, without getting off the desk.
 'Come in.
 Stay.
  Just look out into the yard, and see whether there's a boy standing on  his head.
'    'No, sir,' replied Nell.
 'He's on his feet.
'    'You're sure he is?' said Quilp.
 'Well.
 Now, come in and shut the door.
  What's your message, Nelly?'    The child handed him a letter.
 Mr Quilp, without changing his position  further than to turn over a little more on his side and rest his chin  on his hand, proceeded to make himself acquainted with its contents.
              Little Nell stood timidly by, with her eyes raised to the countenance  of Mr Quilp as he read the letter, plainly showing by her looks that  while she entertained some fear and distrust of the little man, she was  much inclined to laugh at his uncouth appearance and grotesque  attitude.
 And yet there was visible on the part of the child a painful  anxiety for his reply, and consciousness of his power to render it  disagreeable or distressing, which was strongly at variance with this  impulse and restrained it more effectually than she could possibly have  done by any efforts of her own.
    That Mr Quilp was himself perplexed, and that in no small degree, by  the contents of the letter, was sufficiently obvious.
 Before he had got  through the first two or three lines he began to open his eyes very  wide and to frown most horribly, the next two or three caused him to  scratch his head in an uncommonly vicious manner, and when he came to  the conclusion he gave a long dismal whistle indicative of surprise and  dismay.
 After folding and laying it down beside him, he bit the nails  of all of his ten fingers with extreme voracity; and taking it up  sharply, read it again.
 The second perusal was to all appearance as  unsatisfactory as the first, and plunged him into a profound reverie  from which he awakened to another assault upon his nails and a long  stare at the child, who with her eyes turned towards the ground awaited  his further pleasure.
    'Halloa here!' he said at length, in a voice, and with a suddenness,  which made the child start as though a gun had been fired off at her  ear.
 'Nelly!'    'Yes, sir.
'    'Do you know what's inside this letter, Nell?'    'No, sir!'    'Are you sure, quite sure, quite certain, upon your soul?'    'Quite sure, sir.
'    'Do you wish you may die if you do know, hey?' said the dwarf.
    'Indeed I don't know,' returned the child.
    'Well!' muttered Quilp as he marked her earnest look.
 'I believe you.
  Humph! Gone already? Gone in four-and-twenty hours! What the devil has  he done with it, that's the mystery!'    This reflection set him scratching his head and biting his nails once  more.
 While he was thus employed his features gradually relaxed into  what was with him a cheerful smile, but which in any other man would  have been a ghastly grin of pain, and when the child looked up again  she found that he was regarding her with extraordinary favour and  complacency.
    'You look very pretty to-day, Nelly, charmingly pretty.
 Are you tired,  Nelly?'    'No, sir.
 I'm in a hurry to get back, for he will be anxious while I am  away.
'    'There's no hurry, little Nell, no hurry at all,' said Quilp.
 'How  should you like to be my number two, Nelly?'    'To be what, sir?'    'My number two, Nelly, my second, my Mrs Quilp,' said the dwarf.
    The child looked frightened, but seemed not to understand him, which Mr  Quilp observing, hastened to make his meaning more distinctly.
    'To be Mrs Quilp the second, when Mrs Quilp the first is dead, sweet  Nell,' said Quilp, wrinkling up his eyes and luring her towards him  with his bent forefinger, 'to be my wife, my little cherry-cheeked,  red-lipped wife.
 Say that Mrs Quilp lives five year, or only four,  you'll be just the proper age for me.
 Ha ha! Be a good girl, Nelly, a  very good girl, and see if one of these days you don't come to be Mrs  Quilp of Tower Hill.
'    So far from being sustained and stimulated by this delightful prospect,  the child shrank from him in great agitation, and trembled violently.
  Mr Quilp, either because frightening anybody afforded him a  constitutional delight, or because it was pleasant to contemplate the  death of Mrs Quilp number one, and the elevation of Mrs Quilp number  two to her post and title, or because he was determined from purposes  of his own to be agreeable and good-humoured at that particular time,  only laughed and feigned to take no heed of her alarm.
    'You shall come with me to Tower Hill and see Mrs Quilp that is,  directly,' said the dwarf.
 'She's very fond of you, Nell, though not so  fond as I am.
 You shall come home with me.
'    'I must go back indeed,' said the child.
 'He told me to return directly  I had the answer.
'    'But you haven't it, Nelly,' retorted the dwarf, 'and won't have it,  and can't have it, until I have been home, so you see that to do your  errand, you must go with me.
 Reach me yonder hat, my dear, and we'll go  directly.
' With that, Mr Quilp suffered himself to roll gradually off  the desk until his short legs touched the ground, when he got upon them  and led the way from the counting-house to the wharf outside, when the  first objects that presented themselves were the boy who had stood on  his head and another young gentleman of about his own stature, rolling  in the mud together, locked in a tight embrace, and cuffing each other  with mutual heartiness.
    'It's Kit!' cried Nelly, clasping her hand, 'poor Kit who came with me!  Oh, pray stop them, Mr Quilp!'    'I'll stop 'em,' cried Quilp, diving into the little counting-house and  returning with a thick stick, 'I'll stop 'em.
 Now, my boys, fight away.
  I'll fight you both.
 I'll take both of you, both together, both  together!'    With which defiances the dwarf flourished his cudgel, and dancing round  the combatants and treading upon them and skipping over them, in a kind  of frenzy, laid about him, now on one and now on the other, in a most  desperate manner, always aiming at their heads and dealing such blows  as none but the veriest little savage would have inflicted.
 This being  warmer work than they had calculated upon, speedily cooled the courage  of the belligerents, who scrambled to their feet and called for quarter.
    'I'll beat you to a pulp, you dogs,' said Quilp, vainly endeavoring to  get near either of them for a parting blow.
 'I'll bruise you until  you're copper-coloured, I'll break your faces till you haven't a  profile between you, I will.
'    'Come, you drop that stick or it'll be worse for you,' said his boy,  dodging round him and watching an opportunity to rush in; 'you drop  that stick.
'    'Come a little nearer, and I'll drop it on your skull, you dog,' said  Quilp, with gleaming eyes; 'a little nearer--nearer yet.
'    But the boy declined the invitation until his master was apparently a  little off his guard, when he darted in and seizing the weapon tried to  wrest it from his grasp.
 Quilp, who was as strong as a lion, easily  kept his hold until the boy was tugging at it with his utmost power,  when he suddenly let it go and sent him reeling backwards, so that he  fell violently upon his head.
 The success of this manoeuvre tickled Mr  Quilp beyond description, and he laughed and stamped upon the ground as  at a most irresistible jest.
    'Never mind,' said the boy, nodding his head and rubbing it at the same  time; 'you see if ever I offer to strike anybody again because they say  you're an uglier dwarf than can be seen anywheres for a penny, that's  all.
'    'Do you mean to say, I'm not, you dog?' returned Quilp.
    'No!' retorted the boy.
    'Then what do you fight on my wharf for, you villain?' said Quilp.
    'Because he said so,' replied the boy, pointing to Kit, 'not because you  an't.
'    'Then why did he say,' bawled Kit, 'that Miss Nelly was ugly, and that  she and my master was obliged to do whatever his master liked?  Why did  he say that?'    'He said what he did because he's a fool, and you said what you did  because you're very wise and clever--almost too clever to live, unless  you're very careful of yourself, Kit.
' said Quilp, with great suavity  in his manner, but still more of quiet malice about his eyes and mouth.
  'Here's sixpence for you, Kit.
 Always speak the truth.
  At all times,  Kit, speak the truth.
 Lock the counting-house, you dog, and bring me  the key.
'    The other boy, to whom this order was addressed, did as he was told,  and was rewarded for his partizanship in behalf of his master, by a  dexterous rap on the nose with the key, which brought the water into  his eyes.
 Then Mr Quilp departed with the child and Kit in a boat, and  the boy revenged himself by dancing on his head at intervals on the  extreme verge of the wharf, during the whole time they crossed the  river.
    There was only Mrs Quilp at home, and she, little expecting the return  of her lord, was just composing herself for a refreshing slumber when  the sound of his footsteps roused her.
 She had barely time to seem to  be occupied in some needle-work, when he entered, accompanied by the  child; having left Kit downstairs.
    'Here's Nelly Trent, dear Mrs Quilp,' said her husband.
 'A glass of  wine, my dear, and a biscuit, for she has had a long walk.
 She'll sit  with you, my soul, while I write a letter.
'    Mrs Quilp looked tremblingly in her spouse's face to know what this  unusual courtesy might portend, and obedient to the summons she saw in  his gesture, followed him into the next room.
    'Mind what I say to you,' whispered Quilp.
 'See if you can get out of  her anything about her grandfather, or what they do, or how they live,  or what he tells her.
 I've my reasons for knowing, if I can.
 You women  talk more freely to one another than you do to us, and you have a soft,  mild way with you that'll win upon her.
 Do you hear?'    'Yes, Quilp.
'    'Go then.
 What's the matter now?'    'Dear Quilp,' faltered his wife.
 'I love the child--if you could do  without making me deceive her--'    The dwarf muttering a terrible oath looked round as if for some weapon  with which to inflict condign punishment upon his disobedient wife.
 The  submissive little woman hurriedly entreated him not to be angry, and  promised to do as he bade her.
    'Do you hear me,' whispered Quilp, nipping and pinching her arm; 'worm  yourself into her secrets; I know you can.
 I'm listening, recollect.
 If  you're not sharp enough, I'll creak the door, and woe betide you if I  have to creak it much.
 Go!'    Mrs Quilp departed according to order, and her amiable husband,  ensconcing himself behind the partly opened door, and applying his ear  close to it, began to listen with a face of great craftiness and  attention.
    Poor Mrs Quilp was thinking, however, in what manner to begin or what  kind of inquiries she could make; and it was not until the door,  creaking in a very urgent manner, warned her to proceed without further  consideration, that the sound of her voice was heard.
    'How very often you have come backwards and forwards lately to Mr  Quilp, my dear.
'    'I have said so to grandfather, a hundred times,' returned Nell  innocently.
    'And what has he said to that?'    'Only sighed, and dropped his head, and seemed so sad and wretched that  if you could have seen him I am sure you must have cried; you could not  have helped it more than I, I know.
 How that door creaks!'    'It often does.
' returned Mrs Quilp, with an uneasy glance towards it.
  'But your grandfather--he used not to be so wretched?'    'Oh, no!' said the child eagerly, 'so different! We were once so happy  and he so cheerful and contented! You cannot think what a sad change  has fallen on us since.
'    'I am very, very sorry, to hear you speak like this, my dear!' said Mrs  Quilp.
 And she spoke the truth.
    'Thank you,' returned the child, kissing her cheek, 'you are always  kind to me, and it is a pleasure to talk to you.
 I can speak to no one  else about him, but poor Kit.
 I am very happy still, I ought to feel  happier perhaps than I do, but you cannot think how it grieves me  sometimes to see him alter so.
'    'He'll alter again, Nelly,' said Mrs Quilp, 'and be what he was before.
'    'Oh, if God would only let that come about!' said the child with  streaming eyes; 'but it is a long time now, since he first began to--I  thought I saw that door moving!'    'It's the wind,' said Mrs Quilp, faintly.
 'Began to--'    'To be so thoughtful and dejected, and to forget our old way of  spending the time in the long evenings,' said the child.
 'I used to  read to him by the fireside, and he sat listening, and when I stopped  and we began to talk, he told me about my mother, and how she once  looked and spoke just like me when she was a little child.
 Then he used  to take me on his knee, and try to make me understand that she was not  lying in her grave, but had flown to a beautiful country beyond the sky  where nothing died or ever grew old--we were very happy once!'    'Nelly, Nelly!' said the poor woman, 'I can't bear to see one as young  as you so sorrowful.
 Pray don't cry.
'    'I do so very seldom,' said Nell, 'but I have kept this to myself a  long time, and I am not quite well, I think, for the tears come into my  eyes and I cannot keep them back.
 I don't mind telling you my grief,  for I know you will not tell it to any one again.
'    Mrs Quilp turned away her head and made no answer.
    'Then,' said the child, 'we often walked in the fields and among the  green trees, and when we came home at night, we liked it better for  being tired, and said what a happy place it was.
 And if it was dark and  rather dull, we used to say, what did it matter to us, for it only made  us remember our last walk with greater pleasure, and look forward to  our next one.
 But now we never have these walks, and though it is the  same house it is darker and much more gloomy than it used to be,  indeed!'    She paused here, but though the door creaked more than once, Mrs Quilp  said nothing.
    'Mind you don't suppose,' said the child earnestly, 'that grandfather  is less kind to me than he was.
 I think he loves me better every day,  and is kinder and more affectionate than he was the day before.
 You do  not know how fond he is of me!'    'I am sure he loves you dearly,' said Mrs Quilp.
    'Indeed, indeed he does!' cried Nell, 'as dearly as I love him.
 But I  have not told you the greatest change of all, and this you must never  breathe again to any one.
 He has no sleep or rest, but that which he  takes by day in his easy chair; for every night and nearly all night  long he is away from home.
'    'Nelly!'    'Hush!' said the child, laying her finger on her lip and looking round.
  'When he comes home in the morning, which is generally just before day,  I let him in.
 Last night he was very late, and it was quite light.
 I  saw that his face was deadly pale, that his eyes were bloodshot, and  that his legs trembled as he walked.
 When I had gone to bed again, I  heard him groan.
 I got up and ran back to him, and heard him say,  before he knew that I was there, that he could not bear his life much  longer, and if it was not for the child, would wish to die.
 What shall  I do! Oh! What shall I do!'    The fountains of her heart were opened; the child, overpowered by the  weight of her sorrows and anxieties, by the first confidence she had  ever shown, and the sympathy with which her little tale had been  received, hid her face in the arms of her helpless friend, and burst  into a passion of tears.
    In a few minutes Mr Quilp returned, and expressed the utmost surprise  to find her in this condition, which he did very naturally and with  admirable effect, for that kind of acting had been rendered familiar to  him by long practice, and he was quite at home in it.
    'She's tired you see, Mrs Quilp,' said the dwarf, squinting in a  hideous manner to imply that his wife was to follow his lead.
 'It's a  long way from her home to the wharf, and then she was alarmed to see a  couple of young scoundrels fighting, and was timorous on the water  besides.
 All this together has been too much for her.
 Poor Nell!'    Mr Quilp unintentionally adopted the very best means he could have  devised for the recovery of his young visitor, by patting her on the  head.
 Such an application from any other hand might not have produced a  remarkable effect, but the child shrank so quickly from his touch and  felt such an instinctive desire to get out of his reach, that she rose  directly and declared herself ready to return.
    'But you'd better wait, and dine with Mrs Quilp and me.
' said the dwarf.
    'I have been away too long, sir, already,' returned Nell, drying her  eyes.
    'Well,' said Mr Quilp, 'if you will go, you will, Nelly.
 Here's the  note.
 It's only to say that I shall see him to-morrow or maybe next  day, and that I couldn't do that little business for him this morning.
  Good-bye, Nelly.
 Here, you sir; take care of her, d'ye hear?'    Kit, who appeared at the summons, deigned to make no reply to so  needless an injunction, and after staring at Quilp in a threatening  manner, as if he doubted whether he might not have been the cause of  Nelly shedding tears, and felt more than half disposed to revenge the  fact upon him on the mere suspicion, turned about and followed his  young mistress, who had by this time taken her leave of Mrs Quilp and  departed.
    'You're a keen questioner, an't you, Mrs Quilp?' said the dwarf,  turning upon her as soon as they were left alone.
    'What more could I do?' returned his wife mildly.
    'What more could you do!' sneered Quilp, 'couldn't you have done  something less? Couldn't you have done what you had to do, without  appearing in your favourite part of the crocodile, you minx?'    'I am very sorry for the child, Quilp,' said his wife.
 'Surely I've  done enough.
 I've led her on to tell her secret she supposed we were  alone; and you were by, God forgive me.
'    'You led her on! You did a great deal truly!' said Quilp.
 'What did I  tell you about making me creak the door? It's lucky for you that from  what she let fall, I've got the clue I want, for if I hadn't, I'd have  visited the failure upon you, I can tell you.
'    Mrs Quilp being fully persuaded of this, made no reply.
 Her husband  added with some exultation,    'But you may thank your fortunate stars--the same stars that made you  Mrs Quilp--you may thank them that I'm upon the old gentleman's track,  and have got a new light.
 So let me hear no more about this matter now  or at any other time, and don't get anything too nice for dinner, for I  shan't be home to it.
'    So saying, Mr Quilp put his hat on and took himself off, and Mrs Quilp,  who was afflicted beyond measure by the recollection of the part she  had just acted, shut herself up in her chamber, and smothering her head  in the bed-clothes bemoaned her fault more bitterly than many less  tender-hearted persons would have mourned a much greater offence; for,  in the majority of cases, conscience is an elastic and very flexible  article, which will bear a deal of stretching and adapt itself to a  great variety of circumstances.
 Some people by prudent management and  leaving it off piece by piece like a flannel waistcoat in warm weather,  even contrive, in time, to dispense with it altogether; but there be  others who can assume the garment and throw it off at pleasure; and  this, being the greatest and most convenient improvement, is the one  most in vogue.
              'Fred,' said Mr Swiveller, 'remember the once popular melody of Begone  dull care; fan the sinking flame of hilarity with the wing of  friendship; and pass the rosy wine.
'    Mr Richard Swiveller's apartments were in the neighbourhood of Drury  Lane, and in addition to this convenience of situation had the  advantage of being over a tobacconist's shop, so that he was enabled to  procure a refreshing sneeze at any time by merely stepping out upon the  staircase, and was saved the trouble and expense of maintaining a  snuff-box.
 It was in these apartments that Mr Swiveller made use of the  expressions above recorded for the consolation and encouragement of his  desponding friend; and it may not be uninteresting or improper to  remark that even these brief observations partook in a double sense of  the figurative and poetical character of Mr Swiveller's mind, as the  rosy wine was in fact represented by one glass of cold gin-and-water,  which was replenished as occasion required from a bottle and jug upon  the table, and was passed from one to another, in a scarcity of  tumblers which, as Mr Swiveller's was a bachelor's establishment, may  be acknowledged without a blush.
 By a like pleasant fiction his single  chamber was always mentioned in a plural number.
 In its disengaged  times, the tobacconist had announced it in his window as 'apartments'  for a single gentleman, and Mr Swiveller, following up the hint, never  failed to speak of it as his rooms, his lodgings, or his chambers,  conveying to his hearers a notion of indefinite space, and leaving  their imaginations to wander through long suites of lofty halls, at  pleasure.
    In this flight of fancy, Mr Swiveller was assisted by a deceptive piece  of furniture, in reality a bedstead, but in semblance a bookcase, which  occupied a prominent situation in his chamber and seemed to defy  suspicion and challenge inquiry.
 There is no doubt that by day Mr  Swiveller firmly believed this secret convenience to be a bookcase and  nothing more; that he closed his eyes to the bed, resolutely denied the  existence of the blankets, and spurned the bolster from his thoughts.
  No word of its real use, no hint of its nightly service, no allusion to  its peculiar properties, had ever passed between him and his most  intimate friends.
 Implicit faith in the deception was the first article  of his creed.
 To be the friend of Swiveller you must reject all  circumstantial evidence, all reason, observation, and experience, and  repose a blind belief in the bookcase.
 It was his pet weakness, and he  cherished it.
    'Fred!' said Mr Swiveller, finding that his former adjuration had been  productive of no effect.
 'Pass the rosy.
'    Young Trent with an impatient gesture pushed the glass towards him, and  fell again in the moody attitude from which he had been unwillingly  roused.
    'I'll give you, Fred,' said his friend, stirring the mixture, 'a little  sentiment appropriate to the occasion.
 Here's May the--'    'Pshaw!' interposed the other.
 'You worry me to death with your  chattering.
 You can be merry under any circumstances.
'    'Why, Mr Trent,' returned Dick, 'there is a proverb which talks about  being merry and wise.
 There are some people who can be merry and can't  be wise, and some who can be wise (or think they can) and can't be  merry.
 I'm one of the first sort.
 If the proverb's a good 'un, I  suppose it's better to keep to half of it than none; at all events, I'd  rather be merry and not wise, than like you, neither one nor t'other.
'    'Bah!' muttered his friend, peevishly.
    'With all my heart,' said Mr Swiveller.
 'In the polite circles I  believe this sort of thing isn't usually said to a gentleman in his own  apartments, but never mind that.
 Make yourself at home,' adding to this  retort an observation to the effect that his friend appeared to be  rather 'cranky' in point of temper, Richard Swiveller finished the  rosy and applied himself to the composition of another glassful, in  which, after tasting it with great relish, he proposed a toast to an  imaginary company.
    'Gentlemen, I'll give you, if you please, Success to the ancient family  of the Swivellers, and good luck to Mr Richard in particular--Mr  Richard, gentlemen,' said Dick with great emphasis, 'who spends all his  money on his friends and is Bah!'d for his pains.
 Hear, hear!'    'Dick!' said the other, returning to his seat after having paced the  room twice or thrice, 'will you talk seriously for two minutes, if I  show you a way to make your fortune with very little trouble?'    'You've shown me so many,' returned Dick; 'and nothing has come of any  one of 'em but empty pockets--'    'You'll tell a different story of this one, before a very long time is  over,' said his companion, drawing his chair to the table.
 'You saw my  sister Nell?'    'What about her?' returned Dick.
    'She has a pretty face, has she not?'    'Why, certainly,' replied Dick.
 'I must say for her that there's not  any very strong family likeness between her and you.
'    'Has she a pretty face,' repeated his friend impatiently.
    'Yes,' said Dick, 'she has a pretty face, a very pretty face.
 What of  that?'    'I'll tell you,' returned his friend.
 'It's very plain that the old man  and I will remain at daggers drawn to the end of our lives, and that I  have nothing to expect from him.
 You see that, I suppose?'    'A bat might see that, with the sun shining,' said Dick.
    'It's equally plain that the money which the old flint--rot him--first  taught me to expect that I should share with her at his death, will all  be hers, is it not?'    'I should said it was,' replied Dick; 'unless the way in which I put  the case to him, made an impression.
 It may have done so.
 It was  powerful, Fred.
 'Here is a jolly old grandfather'--that was strong, I  thought--very friendly and natural.
 Did it strike you in that way?'    'It didn't strike him,' returned the other, 'so we needn't discuss it.
  Now look here.
 Nell is nearly fourteen.
'    'Fine girl of her age, but small,' observed Richard Swiveller  parenthetically.
    'If I am to go on, be quiet for one minute,' returned Trent, fretting  at the slight interest the other appeared to take in the conversation.
  'Now I'm coming to the point.
'    'That's right,' said Dick.
    'The girl has strong affections, and brought up as she has been, may,  at her age, be easily influenced and persuaded.
 If I take her in hand,  I will be bound by a very little coaxing and threatening to bend her to  my will.
 Not to beat about the bush (for the advantages of the scheme  would take a week to tell) what's to prevent your marrying her?'    Richard Swiveller, who had been looking over the rim of the tumbler  while his companion addressed the foregoing remarks to him with great  energy and earnestness of manner, no sooner heard these words than he  evinced the utmost consternation, and with difficulty ejaculated the  monosyllable:    'What!'    'I say, what's to prevent,' repeated the other with a steadiness of  manner, of the effect of which upon his companion he was well assured  by long experience, 'what's to prevent your marrying her?'    'And she "nearly fourteen"!' cried Dick.
    'I don't mean marrying her now'--returned the brother angrily; 'say in  two year's time, in three, in four.
 Does the old man look like a  long-liver?'    'He don't look like it,' said Dick shaking his head, 'but these old  people--there's no trusting them, Fred.
 There's an aunt of mine down in  Dorsetshire that was going to die when I was eight years old, and  hasn't kept her word yet.
 They're so aggravating, so unprincipled, so  spiteful--unless there's apoplexy in the family, Fred, you can't  calculate upon 'em, and even then they deceive you just as often as  not.
'    'Look at the worst side of the question then,' said Trent as steadily  as before, and keeping his eyes upon his friend.
 'Suppose he lives.
'    'To be sure,' said Dick.
 'There's the rub.
'    'I say,' resumed his friend, 'suppose he lives, and I persuaded, or if  the word sounds more feasible, forced Nell to a secret marriage with  you.
 What do you think would come of that?'    'A family and an annual income of nothing, to keep 'em on,' said  Richard Swiveller after some reflection.
    'I tell you,' returned the other with an increased earnestness, which,  whether it were real or assumed, had the same effect on his companion,  'that he lives for her, that his whole energies and thoughts are bound  up in her, that he would no more disinherit her for an act of  disobedience than he would take me into his favour again for any act of  obedience or virtue that I could possibly be guilty of.
 He could not do  it.
 You or any other man with eyes in his head may see that, if he  chooses.
'    'It seems improbable certainly,' said Dick, musing.
    'It seems improbable because it is improbable,' his friend returned.
  'If you would furnish him with an additional inducement to forgive you,  let there be an irreconcilable breach, a most deadly quarrel, between  you and me--let there be a pretense of such a thing, I mean, of  course--and he'll do fast enough.
 As to Nell, constant dropping will  wear away a stone; you know you may trust to me as far as she is  concerned.
 So, whether he lives or dies, what does it come to?  That  you become the sole inheritor of the wealth of this rich old hunks,  that you and I spend it together, and that you get into the bargain a  beautiful young wife.
'    'I suppose there's no doubt about his being rich'--said Dick.
    'Doubt! Did you hear what he let fall the other day when we were  there? Doubt! What will you doubt next, Dick?'    It would be tedious to pursue the conversation through all its artful  windings, or to develope the gradual approaches by which the heart of  Richard Swiveller was gained.
 It is sufficient to know that vanity,  interest, poverty, and every spendthrift consideration urged him to  look upon the proposal with favour, and that where all other  inducements were wanting, the habitual carelessness of his disposition  stepped in and still weighed down the scale on the same side.
 To these  impulses must be added the complete ascendancy which his friend had  long been accustomed to exercise over him--an ascendancy exerted in the  beginning sorely at the expense of his friend's vices, and was in nine  cases out of ten looked upon as his designing tempter when he was  indeed nothing but his thoughtless, light-headed tool.
    The motives on the other side were something deeper than any which  Richard Swiveller entertained or understood, but these being left to  their own development, require no present elucidation.
 The negotiation  was concluded very pleasantly, and Mr Swiveller was in the act of  stating in flowery terms that he had no insurmountable objection to  marrying anybody plentifully endowed with money or moveables, who could  be induced to take him, when he was interrupted in his observations by  a knock at the door, and the consequent necessity of crying 'Come in.
'    The door was opened, but nothing came in except a soapy arm and a  strong gush of tobacco.
 The gush of tobacco came from the shop  downstairs, and the soapy arm proceeded from the body of a  servant-girl, who being then and there engaged in cleaning the stairs  had just drawn it out of a warm pail to take in a letter, which letter  she now held in her hand, proclaiming aloud with that quick perception  of surnames peculiar to her class that it was for Mister Snivelling.
    Dick looked rather pale and foolish when he glanced at the direction,  and still more so when he came to look at the inside, observing that it  was one of the inconveniences of being a lady's man, and that it was  very easy to talk as they had been talking, but he had quite forgotten  her.
    'Her.
 Who?' demanded Trent.
    'Sophy Wackles,' said Dick.
    'Who's she?'    'She's all my fancy painted her, sir, that's what she is,' said Mr  Swiveller, taking a long pull at 'the rosy' and looking gravely at his  friend.
 'She's lovely, she's divine.
 You know her.
'    'I remember,' said his companion carelessly.
 'What of her?'    'Why, sir,' returned Dick, 'between Miss Sophia Wackles and the humble  individual who has now the honor to address you, warm and tender  sentiments have been engendered, sentiments of the most honourable and  inspiring kind.
 The Goddess Diana, sir, that calls aloud for the chase,  is not more particular in her behavior than Sophia Wackles; I can tell  you that.
'    'Am I to believe there's anything real in what you say?' demanded his  friend; 'you don't mean to say that any love-making has been going on?'    'Love-making, yes.
 Promising, no,' said Dick.
 'There can be no action  for breach, that's one comfort.
 I've never committed myself in writing,  Fred.
'    'And what's in the letter, pray?'    'A reminder, Fred, for to-night--a small party of twenty, making two  hundred light fantastic toes in all, supposing every lady and gentleman  to have the proper complement.
 I must go, if it's only to begin  breaking off the affair--I'll do it, don't you be afraid.
 I should like  to know whether she left this herself.
 If she did, unconscious of any  bar to her happiness, it's affecting, Fred.
'    To solve this question, Mr Swiveller summoned the handmaid and  ascertained that Miss Sophy Wackles had indeed left the letter with her  own hands; and that she had come accompanied, for decorum's sake no  doubt, by a younger Miss Wackles; and that on learning that Mr  Swiveller was at home and being requested to walk upstairs, she was  extremely shocked and professed that she would rather die.
 Mr Swiveller  heard this account with a degree of admiration not altogether  consistent with the project in which he had just concurred, but his  friend attached very little importance to his behavior in this respect,  probably because he knew that he had influence sufficient to control  Richard Swiveller's proceedings in this or any other matter, whenever  he deemed it necessary, for the advancement of his own purposes, to  exert it.
              Business disposed of, Mr Swiveller was inwardly reminded of its being  nigh dinner-time, and to the intent that his health might not be  endangered by longer abstinence, dispatched a message to the nearest  eating-house requiring an immediate supply of boiled beef and greens  for two.
 With this demand, however, the eating-house (having experience  of its customer) declined to comply, churlishly sending back for answer  that if Mr Swiveller stood in need of beef perhaps he would be so  obliging as to come there and eat it, bringing with him, as grace  before meat, the amount of a certain small account which had long been  outstanding.
 Not at all intimidated by this rebuff, but rather  sharpened in wits and appetite, Mr Swiveller forwarded the same message  to another and more distant eating-house, adding to it by way of rider  that the gentleman was induced to send so far, not only by the great  fame and popularity its beef had acquired, but in consequence of the  extreme toughness of the beef retailed at the obdurant cook's shop,  which rendered it quite unfit not merely for gentlemanly food, but for  any human consumption.
 The good effect of this politic course was  demonstrated by the speedy arrival of a small pewter pyramid, curiously  constructed of platters and covers, whereof the boiled-beef-plates  formed the base, and a foaming quart-pot the apex; the structure being  resolved into its component parts afforded all things requisite and  necessary for a hearty meal, to which Mr Swiveller and his friend  applied themselves with great keenness and enjoyment.
    'May the present moment,' said Dick, sticking his fork into a large  carbuncular potato, 'be the worst of our lives! I like the plan of  sending 'em with the peel on; there's a charm in drawing a potato from  its native element (if I may so express it) to which the rich and  powerful are strangers.
 Ah! "Man wants but little here below, nor wants  that little long!" How true that is!--after dinner.
'    'I hope the eating-house keeper will want but little and that he may  not want that little long,' returned his companion; but I suspect  you've no means of paying for this!'    'I shall be passing present, and I'll call,' said Dick, winking his eye  significantly.
 'The waiter's quite helpless.
 The goods are gone, Fred,  and there's an end of it.
'    In point of fact, it would seem that the waiter felt this wholesome  truth, for when he returned for the empty plates and dishes and was  informed by Mr Swiveller with dignified carelessness that he would call  and settle when he should be passing presently, he displayed some  perturbation of spirit and muttered a few remarks about 'payment on  delivery' and 'no trust,' and other unpleasant subjects, but was fain  to content himself with inquiring at what hour it was likely that the  gentleman would call, in order that being presently responsible for the  beef, greens, and sundries, he might take to be in the way at the time.
  Mr Swiveller, after mentally calculating his engagements to a nicety,  replied that he should look in at from two minutes before six and seven  minutes past; and the man disappearing with this feeble consolation,  Richard Swiveller took a greasy memorandum-book from his pocket and  made an entry therein.
    'Is that a reminder, in case you should forget to call?' said Trent  with a sneer.
    'Not exactly, Fred,' replied the imperturbable Richard, continuing to  write with a businesslike air.
 'I enter in this little book the names  of the streets that I can't go down while the shops are open.
 This  dinner today closes Long Acre.
 I bought a pair of boots in Great Queen  Street last week, and made that no throughfare too.
 There's only one  avenue to the Strand left often now, and I shall have to stop up that  to-night with a pair of gloves.
 The roads are closing so fast in every  direction, that in a month's time, unless my aunt sends me a  remittance, I shall have to go three or four miles out of town to get  over the way.
'    'There's no fear of failing, in the end?' said Trent.
    'Why, I hope not,' returned Mr Swiveller, 'but the average number of  letters it take to soften her is six, and this time we have got as far  as eight without any effect at all.
 I'll write another to-morrow  morning.
 I mean to blot it a good deal and shake some water over it out  of the pepper-castor to make it look penitent.
 "I'm in such a state of  mind that I hardly know what I write"--blot--"if you could see me at  this minute shedding tears for my past misconduct"--pepper-castor--"my  hand trembles when I think"--blot again--if that don't produce the  effect, it's all over.
'    By this time, Mr Swiveller had finished his entry, and he now replaced  his pencil in its little sheath and closed the book, in a perfectly  grave and serious frame of mind.
 His friend discovered that it was time  for him to fulfil some other engagement, and Richard Swiveller was  accordingly left alone, in company with the rosy wine and his own  meditations touching Miss Sophy Wackles.
    'It's rather sudden,' said Dick shaking his head with a look of  infinite wisdom, and running on (as he was accustomed to do) with  scraps of verse as if they were only prose in a hurry; 'when the heart  of a man is depressed with fears, the mist is dispelled when Miss  Wackles appears; she's a very nice girl.
 She's like the red red rose  that's newly sprung in June--there's no denying that--she's also like a  melody that's sweetly played in tune.
 It's really very sudden.
 Not that  there's any need, on account of Fred's little sister, to turn cool  directly, but its better not to go too far.
 If I begin to cool at all I  must begin at once, I see that.
 There's the chance of an action for  breach, that's another.
 There's the chance of--no, there's no chance of  that, but it's as well to be on the safe side.
'    This undeveloped was the possibility, which Richard Swiveller sought to  conceal even from himself, of his not being proof against the charms of  Miss Wackles, and in some unguarded moment, by linking his fortunes to  hers forever, of putting it out of his own power to further their  notable scheme to which he had so readily become a party.
 For all these  reasons, he decided to pick a quarrel with Miss Wackles without delay,  and casting about for a pretext determined in favour of groundless  jealousy.
  Having made up his mind on this important point, he  circulated the glass (from his right hand to left, and back again)  pretty freely, to enable him to act his part with the greater  discretion, and then, after making some slight improvements in his  toilet, bent his steps towards the spot hallowed by the fair object of  his meditations.
    The spot was at Chelsea, for there Miss Sophia Wackles resided with her  widowed mother and two sisters, in conjunction with whom she maintained  a very small day-school for young ladies of proportionate dimensions; a  circumstance which was made known to the neighbourhood by an oval board  over the front first-floor windows, whereupon appeared in circumambient  flourishes the words 'Ladies' Seminary'; and which was further  published and proclaimed at intervals between the hours of half-past  nine and ten in the morning, by a straggling and solitary young lady of  tender years standing on the scraper on the tips of her toes and making  futile attempts to reach the knocker with a spelling-book.
 The several  duties of instruction in this establishment were thus discharged.
  English grammar, composition, geography, and the use of the dumb-bells,  by Miss Melissa Wackles; writing, arithmetic, dancing, music, and  general fascination, by Miss Sophia Wackles; the art of needle-work,  marking, and samplery, by Miss Jane Wackles; corporal punishment,  fasting, and other tortures and terrors, by Mrs Wackles.
 Miss Melissa  Wackles was the eldest daughter, Miss Sophy the next, and Miss Jane the  youngest.
 Miss Melissa might have seen five-and-thirty summers or  thereabouts, and verged on the autumnal; Miss Sophy was a fresh, good  humoured, buxom girl of twenty; and Miss Jane numbered scarcely sixteen  years.
 Mrs Wackles was an excellent but rather venomous old lady of  three-score.
    To this Ladies' Seminary, then, Richard Swiveller hied, with designs  obnoxious to the peace of the fair Sophia, who, arrayed in virgin  white, embellished by no ornament but one blushing rose, received him  on his arrival, in the midst of very elegant not to say brilliant  preparations; such as the embellishment of the room with the little  flower-pots which always stood on the window-sill outside, save in  windy weather when they blew into the area; the choice attire of the  day-scholars who were allowed to grace the festival; the unwonted curls  of Miss Jane Wackles who had kept her head during the whole of the  preceding day screwed up tight in a yellow play-bill; and the solemn  gentility and stately bearing of the old lady and her eldest daughter,  which struck Mr Swiveller as being uncommon but made no further  impression upon him.
    The truth is--and, as there is no accounting for tastes, even a taste  so strange as this may be recorded without being looked upon as a  wilful and malicious invention--the truth is that neither Mrs Wackles  nor her eldest daughter had at any time greatly favoured the  pretensions of Mr Swiveller, being accustomed to make slight mention of  him as 'a gay young man' and to sigh and shake their heads ominously  whenever his name was mentioned.
 Mr Swiveller's conduct in respect to  Miss Sophy having been of that vague and dilatory kind which is usually  looked upon as betokening no fixed matrimonial intentions, the young  lady herself began in course of time to deem it highly desirable, that  it should be brought to an issue one way or other.
 Hence she had at  last consented to play off against Richard Swiveller a stricken  market-gardner known to be ready with his offer on the smallest  encouragement, and hence--as this occasion had been specially assigned  for the purpose--that great anxiety on her part for Richard Swiveller's  presence which had occasioned her to leave the note he has been seen to  receive.
 'If he has any expectations at all or any means of keeping a  wife well,' said Mrs Wackles to her eldest daughter, 'he'll state 'em  to us now or never.
'--'If he really cares about me,' thought Miss  Sophy, 'he must tell me so, to-night.
'    But all these sayings and doings and thinkings being unknown to Mr  Swiveller, affected him not in the least; he was debating in his mind  how he could best turn jealous, and wishing that Sophy were for that  occasion only far less pretty than she was, or that she were her own  sister, which would have served his turn as well, when the company  came, and among them the market-gardener, whose name was Cheggs.
 But Mr  Cheggs came not alone or unsupported, for he prudently brought along  with him his sister, Miss Cheggs, who making straight to Miss Sophy and  taking her by both hands, and kissing her on both cheeks, hoped in an  audible whisper that they had not come too early.
    'Too early, no!' replied Miss Sophy.
    'Oh, my dear,' rejoined Miss Cheggs in the same whisper as before,  'I've been so tormented, so worried, that it's a mercy we were not here  at four o'clock in the afternoon.
 Alick has been in such a state of  impatience to come! You'd hardly believe that he was dressed before  dinner-time and has been looking at the clock and teasing me ever  since.
 It's all your fault, you naughty thing.
'    Hereupon Miss Sophy blushed, and Mr Cheggs (who was bashful before  ladies) blushed too, and Miss Sophy's mother and sisters, to prevent Mr  Cheggs from blushing more, lavished civilities and attentions upon him,  and left Richard Swiveller to take care of himself.
 Here was the very  thing he wanted, here was good cause reason and foundation for  pretending to be angry; but having this cause reason and foundation  which he had come expressly to seek, not expecting to find, Richard  Swiveller was angry in sound earnest, and wondered what the devil  Cheggs meant by his impudence.
    However, Mr Swiveller had Miss Sophy's hand for the first quadrille  (country-dances being low, were utterly proscribed) and so gained an  advantage over his rival, who sat despondingly in a corner and  contemplated the glorious figure of the young lady as she moved through  the mazy dance.
 Nor was this the only start Mr Swiveller had of the  market-gardener, for determining to show the family what quality of man  they trifled with, and influenced perhaps by his late libations, he  performed such feats of agility and such spins and twirls as filled the  company with astonishment, and in particular caused a very long  gentleman who was dancing with a very short scholar, to stand quite  transfixed by wonder and admiration.
 Even Mrs Wackles forgot for the  moment to snub three small young ladies who were inclined to be happy,  and could not repress a rising thought that to have such a dancer as  that in the family would be a pride indeed.
    At this momentous crisis, Miss Cheggs proved herself a vigourous and  useful ally, for not confining herself to expressing by scornful smiles  a contempt for Mr Swiveller's accomplishments, she took every  opportunity of whispering into Miss Sophy's ear expressions of  condolence and sympathy on her being worried by such a ridiculous  creature, declaring that she was frightened to death lest Alick should  fall upon, and beat him, in the fulness of his wrath, and entreating  Miss Sophy to observe how the eyes of the said Alick gleamed with love  and fury; passions, it may be observed, which being too much for his  eyes rushed into his nose also, and suffused it with a crimson glow.
    'You must dance with Miss Cheggs,' said Miss Sophy to Dick Swiviller,  after she had herself danced twice with Mr Cheggs and made great show  of encouraging his advances.
 'She's a nice girl--and her brother's  quite delightful.
'    'Quite delightful, is he?' muttered Dick.
 'Quite delighted too, I  should say, from the manner in which he's looking this way.
'    Here Miss Jane (previously instructed for the purpose) interposed her  many curls and whispered her sister to observe how jealous Mr Cheggs  was.
    'Jealous! Like his impudence!' said Richard Swiviller.
    'His impudence, Mr Swiviller!' said Miss Jane, tossing her head.
  'Take  care he don't hear you, sir, or you may be sorry for it.
'    'Oh, pray, Jane--' said Miss Sophy.
    'Nonsense!' replied her sister.
 'Why shouldn't Mr Cheggs be jealous if  he likes? I like that, certainly.
 Mr Cheggs has a good a right to be  jealous as anyone else has, and perhaps he may have a better right soon  if he hasn't already.
 You know best about that, Sophy!'    Though this was a concerted plot between Miss Sophy and her sister,  originating in humane intentions and having for its object the inducing  Mr Swiviller to declare himself in time, it failed in its effect; for  Miss Jane being one of those young ladies who are prematurely shrill  and shrewish, gave such undue importance to her part that Mr Swiviller  retired in dudgeon, resigning his mistress to Mr Cheggs and conveying a  defiance into his looks which that gentleman indignantly returned.
    'Did you speak to me, sir?' said Mr Cheggs, following him into a  corner.
 'Have the kindness to smile, sir, in order that we may not be  suspected.
 Did you speak to me, sir'?    Mr Swiviller looked with a supercilious smile at Mr Chegg's toes, then  raised his eyes from them to his ankles, from that to his shin, from  that to his knee, and so on very gradually, keeping up his right leg,  until he reached his waistcoat, when he raised his eyes from button to  button until he reached his chin, and travelling straight up the middle  of his nose came at last to his eyes, when he said abruptly,    'No, sir, I didn't.
'    `'Hem!' said Mr Cheggs, glancing over his shoulder, 'have the goodness  to smile again, sir.
 Perhaps you wished to speak to me, sir.
'    'No, sir, I didn't do that, either.
'    'Perhaps you may have nothing to say to me now, sir,' said Mr Cheggs  fiercely.
    At these words Richard Swiviller withdrew his eyes from Mr Chegg's  face, and travelling down the middle of his nose and down his waistcoat  and down his right leg, reached his toes again, and carefully surveyed  him; this done, he crossed over, and coming up the other leg, and  thence approaching by the waistcoat as before, said when had got to his  eyes, 'No sir, I haven't.
'    'Oh, indeed, sir!' said Mr Cheggs.
 'I'm glad to hear it.
 You know where  I'm to be found, I suppose, sir, in case you should have anything to  say to me?'    'I can easily inquire, sir, when I want to know.
'    'There's nothing more we need say, I believe, sir?'    'Nothing more, sir'--With that they closed the tremendous dialog by  frowning mutually.
 Mr Cheggs hastened to tender his hand to Miss Sophy,  and Mr Swiviller sat himself down in a corner in a very moody state.
    Hard by this corner, Mrs Wackles and Miss Wackles were seated, looking  on at the dance; and unto Mrs and Miss Wackles, Miss Cheggs  occasionally darted when her partner was occupied with his share of the  figure, and made some remark or other which was gall and wormwood to  Richard Swiviller's soul.
 Looking into the eyes of Mrs and Miss Wackles  for encouragement, and sitting very upright and uncomfortable on a  couple of hard stools, were two of the day-scholars; and when Miss  Wackles smiled, and Mrs Wackles smiled, the two little girls on the  stools sought to curry favour by smiling likewise, in gracious  acknowledgement of which attention the old lady frowned them down  instantly, and said that if they dared to be guilty of such an  impertinence again, they should be sent under convoy to their  respective homes.
 This threat caused one of the young ladies, she being  of a weak and trembling temperament, to shed tears, and for this  offense they were both filed off immediately, with a dreadful  promptitude that struck terror into the souls of all the pupils.
    'I've got such news for you,' said Miss Cheggs approaching once more,  'Alick has been saying such things to Sophy.
 Upon my word, you know,  it's quite serious and in earnest, that's clear.
'    'What's he been saying, my dear?' demanded Mrs Wackles.
    'All manner of things,' replied Miss Cheggs, 'you can't think how out  he has been speaking!'    Richard Swiviller considered it advisable to hear no more, but taking  advantage of a pause in the dancing, and the approach of Mr Cheggs to  pay his court to the old lady, swaggered with an extremely careful  assumption of extreme carelessness toward the door, passing on the way  Miss Jane Wackles, who in all the glory of her curls was holding a  flirtation, (as good practice when no better was to be had) with a  feeble old gentleman who lodged in the parlour.
 Near the door sat Miss  Sophy, still fluttered and confused by the attentions of Mr Cheggs, and  by her side Richard Swiveller lingered for a moment to exchange a few  parting words.
    'My boat is on the shore and my bark is on the sea, but before I pass  this door I will say farewell to thee,' murmured Dick, looking gloomily  upon her.
    'Are you going?' said Miss Sophy, whose heart sank within her at the  result of her stratagem, but who affected a light indifference  notwithstanding.
    'Am I going!' echoed Dick bitterly.
 'Yes, I am.
 What then?'    'Nothing, except that it's very early,' said Miss Sophy; 'but you are  your own master, of course.
'    'I would that I had been my own mistress too,' said Dick, 'before I had  ever entertained a thought of you.
 Miss Wackles, I believed you true,  and I was blest in so believing, but now I mourn that e'er I knew, a  girl so fair yet so deceiving.
'    Miss Sophy bit her lip and affected to look with great interest after  Mr Cheggs, who was quaffing lemonade in the distance.
    'I came here,' said Dick, rather oblivious of the purpose with which he  had really come, 'with my bosom expanded, my heart dilated, and my  sentiments of a corresponding description.
 I go away with feelings that  may be conceived but cannot be described, feeling within myself that  desolating truth that my best affections have experienced this night a  stifler!'    'I am sure I don't know what you mean, Mr Swiviller,' said Miss Sophy  with downcast eyes.
 'I'm very sorry if--'    'Sorry, Ma'am!' said Dick, 'sorry in the possession of a Cheggs! But I  wish you a very good night, concluding with this slight remark, that  there is a young lady growing up at this present moment for me, who has  not only great personal attractions but great wealth, and who has  requested her next of kin to propose for my hand, which, having a  regard for some members of her family, I have consented to promise.
  It's a gratifying circumstance which you'll be glad to hear, that a  young and lovely girl is growing into a woman expressly on my account,  and is now saving up for me.
 I thought I'd mention it.
 I have now  merely to apologize for trespassing so long upon your attention.
 Good  night.
'    'There's one good thing springs out of all this,' said Richard  Swiviller to himself when he had reached home and was hanging over the  candle with the extinguisher in his hand, 'which is, that I now go  heart and soul, neck and heels, with Fred in all his scheme about  little Nelly, and right glad he'll be to find me so strong upon it.
 He  shall know all about that to-morrow, and in the meantime, as it's  rather late, I'll try and get a wink of the balmy.
'    'The balmy' came almost as soon as it was courted.
 In a very few  minutes Mr Swiviller was fast asleep, dreaming that he had married  Nelly Trent and come into the property, and that his first act of power  was to lay waste the market-garden of Mr Cheggs and turn it into a  brick-field.
              The child, in her confidence with Mrs Quilp, had but feebly described  the sadness and sorrow of her thoughts, or the heaviness of the cloud  which overhung her home, and cast dark shadows on its hearth.
  Besides  that it was very difficult to impart to any person not intimately  acquainted with the life she led, an adequate sense of its gloom and  loneliness, a constant fear of in some way committing or injuring the  old man to whom she was so tenderly attached, had restrained her, even  in the midst of her heart's overflowing, and made her timid of allusion  to the main cause of her anxiety and distress.
    For, it was not the monotonous days unchequered by variety and  uncheered by pleasant companionship, it was not the dark dreary  evenings or the long solitary nights, it was not the absence of every  slight and easy pleasure for which young hearts beat high, or the  knowing nothing of childhood but its weakness and its easily wounded  spirit, that had wrung such tears from Nell.
  To see the old man struck  down beneath the pressure of some hidden grief, to mark his wavering  and unsettled state, to be agitated at times with a dreadful fear that  his mind was wandering, and to trace in his words and looks the dawning  of despondent madness; to watch and wait and listen for confirmation of  these things day after day, and to feel and know that, come what might,  they were alone in the world with no one to help or advise or care  about them--these were causes of depression and anxiety that might have  sat heavily on an older breast with many influences at work to cheer  and gladden it, but how heavily on the mind of a young child to whom  they were ever present, and who was constantly surrounded by all that  could keep such thoughts in restless action!    And yet, to the old man's vision, Nell was still the same.
  When he  could, for a moment, disengage his mind from the phantom that haunted  and brooded on it always, there was his young companion with the same  smile for him, the same earnest words, the same merry laugh, the same  love and care that, sinking deep into his soul, seemed to have been  present to him through his whole life.
  And so he went on, content to  read the book of her heart from the page first presented to him, little  dreaming of the story that lay hidden in its other leaves, and  murmuring within himself that at least the child was happy.
    She had been once.
  She had gone singing through the dim rooms, and  moving with gay and lightsome step among their dusty treasures, making  them older by her young life, and sterner and more grim by her gay and  cheerful presence.
  But, now, the chambers were cold and gloomy, and  when she left her own little room to while away the tedious hours, and  sat in one of them, she was still and motionless as their inanimate  occupants, and had no heart to startle the echoes--hoarse from their  long silence--with her voice.
    In one of these rooms, was a window looking into the street, where the  child sat, many and many a long evening, and often far into the night,  alone and thoughtful.
  None are so anxious as those who watch and wait;  at these times, mournful fancies came flocking on her mind, in crowds.
    She would take her station here, at dusk, and watch the people as they  passed up and down the street, or appeared at the windows of the  opposite houses; wondering whether those rooms were as lonesome as that  in which she sat, and whether those people felt it company to see her  sitting there, as she did only to see them look out and draw in their  heads again.
  There was a crooked stack of chimneys on one of the  roofs, in which, by often looking at them, she had fancied ugly faces  that were frowning over at her and trying to peer into the room; and  she felt glad when it grew too dark to make them out, though she was  sorry too, when the man came to light the lamps in the street--for it  made it late, and very dull inside.
  Then, she would draw in her head  to look round the room and see that everything was in its place and  hadn't moved; and looking out into the street again, would perhaps see  a man passing with a coffin on his back, and two or three others  silently following him to a house where somebody lay dead; which made  her shudder and think of such things until they suggested afresh the  old man's altered face and manner, and a new train of fears and  speculations.
  If he were to die--if sudden illness had happened to  him, and he were never to come home again, alive--if, one night, he  should come home, and kiss and bless her as usual, and after she had  gone to bed and had fallen asleep and was perhaps dreaming pleasantly,  and smiling in her sleep, he should kill himself and his blood come  creeping, creeping, on the ground to her own bed-room door!  These  thoughts were too terrible to dwell upon, and again she would have  recourse to the street, now trodden by fewer feet, and darker and more  silent than before.
  The shops were closing fast, and lights began to  shine from the upper windows, as the neighbours went to bed.
  By  degrees, these dwindled away and disappeared or were replaced, here and  there, by a feeble rush-candle which was to burn all night.
  Still,  there was one late shop at no great distance which sent forth a ruddy  glare upon the pavement even yet, and looked bright and companionable.
  But, in a little time, this closed, the light was extinguished, and all  was gloomy and quiet, except when some stray footsteps sounded on the  pavement, or a neighbour, out later than his wont, knocked lustily at  his house-door to rouse the sleeping inmates.
    When the night had worn away thus far (and seldom now until it had) the  child would close the window, and steal softly down stairs, thinking as  she went that if one of those hideous faces below, which often mingled  with her dreams, were to meet her by the way, rendering itself visible  by some strange light of its own, how terrified she would be.
  But  these fears vanished before a well-trimmed lamp and the familiar aspect  of her own room.
  After praying fervently, and with many bursting  tears, for the old man, and the restoration of his peace of mind and  the happiness they had once enjoyed, she would lay her head upon the  pillow and sob herself to sleep: often starting up again, before the  day-light came, to listen for the bell and respond to the imaginary  summons which had roused her from her slumber.
    One night, the third after Nelly's interview with Mrs Quilp, the old  man, who had been weak and ill all day, said he should not leave home.
  The child's eyes sparkled at the intelligence, but her joy subsided  when they reverted to his worn and sickly face.
    'Two days,' he said, 'two whole, clear, days have passed, and there is  no reply.
  What did he tell thee, Nell?'    'Exactly what I told you, dear grandfather, indeed.
'    'True,' said the old man, faintly.
  'Yes.
  But tell me again, Nell.
  My  head fails me.
  What was it that he told thee?  Nothing more than that  he would see me to-morrow or next day?  That was in the note.
'    'Nothing more,' said the child.
  'Shall I go to him again to-morrow,  dear grandfather?  Very early?  I will be there and back, before  breakfast.
'    The old man shook his head, and sighing mournfully, drew her towards  him.
    ''Twould be of no use, my dear, no earthly use.
  But if he deserts me,  Nell, at this moment--if he deserts me now, when I should, with his  assistance, be recompensed for all the time and money I have lost, and  all the agony of mind I have undergone, which makes me what you see, I  am ruined, and--worse, far worse than that--have ruined thee, for whom  I ventured all.
  If we are beggars--!'    'What if we are?' said the child boldly.
  'Let us be beggars, and be  happy.
'    'Beggars--and happy!' said the old man.
  'Poor child!'    'Dear grandfather,' cried the girl with an energy which shone in her  flushed face, trembling voice, and impassioned gesture, 'I am not a  child in that I think, but even if I am, oh hear me pray that we may  beg, or work in open roads or fields, to earn a scanty living, rather  than live as we do now.
'    'Nelly!' said the old man.
    'Yes, yes, rather than live as we do now,' the child repeated, more  earnestly than before.
  'If you are sorrowful, let me know why and be  sorrowful too; if you waste away and are paler and weaker every day,  let me be your nurse and try to comfort you.
  If you are poor, let us  be poor together; but let me be with you, do let me be with you; do not  let me see such change and not know why, or I shall break my heart and  die.
  Dear grandfather, let us leave this sad place to-morrow, and beg  our way from door to door.
'    The old man covered his face with his hands, and hid it in the pillow  of the couch on which he lay.
    'Let us be beggars,' said the child passing an arm round his neck, 'I  have no fear but we shall have enough, I am sure we shall.
  Let us walk  through country places, and sleep in fields and under trees, and never  think of money again, or anything that can make you sad, but rest at  nights, and have the sun and wind upon our faces in the day, and thank  God together!  Let us never set foot in dark rooms or melancholy  houses, any more, but wander up and down wherever we like to go; and  when you are tired, you shall stop to rest in the pleasantest place  that we can find, and I will go and beg for both.
'    The child's voice was lost in sobs as she dropped upon the old man's  neck; nor did she weep alone.
    These were not words for other ears, nor was it a scene for other eyes.
  And yet other ears and eyes were there and greedily taking in all that  passed, and moreover they were the ears and eyes of no less a person  than Mr Daniel Quilp, who, having entered unseen when the child first  placed herself at the old man's side, refrained--actuated, no doubt, by  motives of the purest delicacy--from interrupting the conversation, and  stood looking on with his accustomed grin.
  Standing, however, being a  tiresome attitude to a gentleman already fatigued with walking, and the  dwarf being one of that kind of persons who usually make themselves at  home, he soon cast his eyes upon a chair, into which he skipped with  uncommon agility, and perching himself on the back with his feet upon  the seat, was thus enabled to look on and listen with greater comfort  to himself, besides gratifying at the same time that taste for doing  something fantastic and monkey-like, which on all occasions had strong  possession of him.
  Here, then, he sat, one leg cocked carelessly over  the other, his chin resting on the palm of his hand, his head turned a  little on one side, and his ugly features twisted into a complacent  grimace.
  And in this position the old man, happening in course of time  to look that way, at length chanced to see him: to his unbounded  astonishment.
    The child uttered a suppressed shriek on beholding this agreeable  figure; in their first surprise both she and the old man, not knowing  what to say, and half doubting its reality, looked shrinkingly at it.
  Not at all disconcerted by this reception, Daniel Quilp preserved the  same attitude, merely nodding twice or thrice with great condescension.
  At length, the old man pronounced his name, and inquired how he came  there.
    'Through the door,' said Quilp pointing over his shoulder with his  thumb.
  'I'm not quite small enough to get through key-holes.
  I wish I  was.
  I want to have some talk with you, particularly, and in private.
  With nobody present, neighbour.
  Good-bye, little Nelly.
'    Nell looked at the old man, who nodded to her to retire, and kissed her  cheek.
    'Ah!' said the dwarf, smacking his lips, 'what a nice kiss that  was--just upon the rosy part.
  What a capital kiss!'    Nell was none the slower in going away, for this remark.
  Quilp looked  after her with an admiring leer, and when she had closed the door, fell  to complimenting the old man upon her charms.
    'Such a fresh, blooming, modest little bud, neighbour,' said Quilp,  nursing his short leg, and making his eyes twinkle very much; 'such a  chubby, rosy, cosy, little Nell!'    The old man answered by a forced smile, and was plainly struggling with  a feeling of the keenest and most exquisite impatience.
  It was not  lost upon Quilp, who delighted in torturing him, or indeed anybody  else, when he could.
    'She's so,' said Quilp, speaking very slowly, and feigning to be quite  absorbed in the subject, 'so small, so compact, so beautifully  modelled, so fair, with such blue veins and such a transparent skin,  and such little feet, and such winning ways--but bless me, you're  nervous!  Why neighbour, what's the matter?  I swear to you,' continued  the dwarf dismounting from the chair and sitting down in it, with a  careful slowness of gesture very different from the rapidity with which  he had sprung up unheard, 'I swear to you that I had no idea old blood  ran so fast or kept so warm.
  I thought it was sluggish in its course,  and cool, quite cool.
  I am pretty sure it ought to be.
  Yours must be  out of order, neighbour.
'    'I believe it is,' groaned the old man, clasping his head with both  hands.
  'There's burning fever here, and something now and then to  which I fear to give a name.
'    The dwarf said never a word, but watched his companion as he paced  restlessly up and down the room, and presently returned to his seat.
  Here he remained, with his head bowed upon his breast for some time,  and then suddenly raising it, said,    'Once, and once for all, have you brought me any money?'    'No!' returned Quilp.
    'Then,' said the old man, clenching his hands desperately, and looking  upwards, 'the child and I are lost!'    'Neighbour,' said Quilp glancing sternly at him, and beating his hand  twice or thrice upon the table to attract his wandering attention, 'let  me be plain with you, and play a fairer game than when you held all the  cards, and I saw but the backs and nothing more.
  You have no secret  from me now.
'    The old man looked up, trembling.
    'You are surprised,' said Quilp.
  'Well, perhaps that's natural.
  You  have no secret from me now, I say; no, not one.
  For now, I know, that  all those sums of money, that all those loans, advances, and supplies  that you have had from me, have found their way to--shall I say the  word?'    'Aye!' replied the old man, 'say it, if you will.
'    'To the gaming-table,' rejoined Quilp, 'your nightly haunt.
  This was  the precious scheme to make your fortune, was it; this was the secret  certain source of wealth in which I was to have sunk my money (if I had  been the fool you took me for); this was your inexhaustible mine of  gold, your El Dorado, eh?'    'Yes,' cried the old man, turning upon him with gleaming eyes, 'it was.
  It is.
  It will be, till I die.
'    'That I should have been blinded,' said Quilp looking contemptuously at  him, 'by a mere shallow gambler!'    'I am no gambler,' cried the old man fiercely.
  'I call Heaven to  witness that I never played for gain of mine, or love of play; that at  every piece I staked, I whispered to myself that orphan's name and  called on Heaven to bless the venture;--which it never did.
  Whom did  it prosper?  Who were those with whom I played?  Men who lived by  plunder, profligacy, and riot; squandering their gold in doing ill, and  propagating vice and evil.
  My winnings would have been from them, my  winnings would have been bestowed to the last farthing on a young  sinless child whose life they would have sweetened and made happy.
  What would they have contracted?  The means of corruption,  wretchedness, and misery.
  Who would not have hoped in such a cause?  Tell me that!  Who would not have hoped as I did?'    'When did you first begin this mad career?' asked Quilp, his taunting  inclination subdued, for a moment, by the old man's grief and wildness.
    'When did I first begin?' he rejoined, passing his hand across his  brow.
  'When was it, that I first began?  When should it be, but when I  began to think how little I had saved, how long a time it took to save  at all, how short a time I might have at my age to live, and how she  would be left to the rough mercies of the world, with barely enough to  keep her from the sorrows that wait on poverty; then it was that I  began to think about it.
'    'After you first came to me to get your precious grandson packed off to  sea?' said Quilp.
    'Shortly after that,' replied the old man.
  'I thought of it a long  time, and had it in my sleep for months.
  Then I began.
  I found no  pleasure in it, I expected none.
  What has it ever brought me but  anxious days and sleepless nights; but loss of health and peace of  mind, and gain of feebleness and sorrow!'    'You lost what money you had laid by, first, and then came to me.
  While I thought you were making your fortune (as you said you were) you  were making yourself a beggar, eh?  Dear me!  And so it comes to pass  that I hold every security you could scrape together, and a bill of  sale upon the--upon the stock and property,' said Quilp standing up and  looking about him, as if to assure himself that none of it had been  taken away.
  'But did you never win?'    'Never!' groaned the old man.
  'Never won back my loss!'    'I thought,' sneered the dwarf, 'that if a man played long enough he  was sure to win at last, or, at the worst, not to come off a loser.
'    'And so he is,' cried the old man, suddenly rousing himself from his  state of despondency, and lashed into the most violent excitement, 'so  he is; I have felt that from the first, I have always known it, I've  seen it, I never felt it half so strongly as I feel it now.
  Quilp, I  have dreamed, three nights, of winning the same large sum, I never  could dream that dream before, though I have often tried.
  Do not  desert me, now I have this chance.
  I have no resource but you, give me  some help, let me try this one last hope.
'    The dwarf shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.
    'See, Quilp, good tender-hearted Quilp,' said the old man, drawing some  scraps of paper from his pocket with a trembling hand, and clasping the  dwarf's arm, 'only see here.
  Look at these figures, the result of long  calculation, and painful and hard experience.
  I MUST win.
  I only want  a little help once more, a few pounds, but two score pounds, dear  Quilp.
'    'The last advance was seventy,' said the dwarf; 'and it went in one  night.
'    'I know it did,' answered the old man, 'but that was the very worst  fortune of all, and the time had not come then.
  Quilp, consider,  consider,' the old man cried, trembling so much the while, that the  papers in his hand fluttered as if they were shaken by the wind, 'that  orphan child!  If I were alone, I could die with gladness--perhaps even  anticipate that doom which is dealt out so unequally: coming, as it  does, on the proud and happy in their strength, and shunning the needy  and afflicted, and all who court it in their despair--but what I have  done, has been for her.
  Help me for her sake I implore you; not for  mine; for hers!'    'I'm sorry I've got an appointment in the city,' said Quilp, looking at  his watch with perfect self-possession, 'or I should have been very  glad to have spent half an hour with you while you composed yourself,  very glad.
'    'Nay, Quilp, good Quilp,' gasped the old man, catching at his skirts,  'you and I have talked together, more than once, of her poor mother's  story.
  The fear of her coming to poverty has perhaps been bred in me  by that.
  Do not be hard upon me, but take that into account.
  You are  a great gainer by me.
  Oh spare me the money for this one last hope!'    'I couldn't do it really,' said Quilp with unusual politeness, 'though  I tell you what--and this is a circumstance worth bearing in mind as  showing how the sharpest among us may be taken in sometimes--I was so  deceived by the penurious way in which you lived, alone with Nelly--'    'All done to save money for tempting fortune, and to make her triumph  greater,' cried the old man.
    'Yes, yes, I understand that now,' said Quilp; 'but I was going to say,  I was so deceived by that, your miserly way, the reputation you had  among those who knew you of being rich, and your repeated assurances  that you would make of my advances treble and quadruple the interest  you paid me, that I'd have advanced you, even now, what you want, on  your simple note of hand, if I hadn't unexpectedly become acquainted  with your secret way of life.
'    'Who is it,' retorted the old man desperately, 'that, notwithstanding  all my caution, told you?  Come.
  Let me know the name--the person.
'    The crafty dwarf, bethinking himself that his giving up the child would  lead to the disclosure of the artifice he had employed, which, as  nothing was to be gained by it, it was well to conceal, stopped short  in his answer and said, 'Now, who do you think?'    'It was Kit, it must have been the boy; he played the spy, and you  tampered with him?' said the old man.
    'How came you to think of him?' said the dwarf in a tone of great  commiseration.
  'Yes, it was Kit.
  Poor Kit!'    So saying, he nodded in a friendly manner, and took his leave: stopping  when he had passed the outer door a little distance, and grinning with  extraordinary delight.
    'Poor Kit!' muttered Quilp.
  'I think it was Kit who said I was an  uglier dwarf than could be seen anywhere for a penny, wasn't it.
  Ha ha  ha!  Poor Kit!'    And with that he went his way, still chuckling as he went.
              Daniel Quilp neither entered nor left the old man's house, unobserved.
  In the shadow of an archway nearly opposite, leading to one of the many  passages which diverged from the main street, there lingered one, who,  having taken up his position when the twilight first came on, still  maintained it with undiminished patience, and leaning against the wall  with the manner of a person who had a long time to wait, and being well  used to it was quite resigned, scarcely changed his attitude for the  hour together.
    This patient lounger attracted little attention from any of those who  passed, and bestowed as little upon them.
  His eyes were constantly  directed towards one object; the window at which the child was  accustomed to sit.
  If he withdrew them for a moment, it was only to  glance at a clock in some neighbouring shop, and then to strain his  sight once more in the old quarter with increased earnestness and  attention.
    It had been remarked that this personage evinced no weariness in his  place of concealment; nor did he, long as his waiting was.
  But as the  time went on, he manifested some anxiety and surprise, glancing at the  clock more frequently and at the window less hopefully than before.
  At  length, the clock was hidden from his sight by some envious shutters,  then the church steeples proclaimed eleven at night, then the quarter  past, and then the conviction seemed to obtrude itself on his mind that  it was no use tarrying there any longer.
    That the conviction was an unwelcome one, and that he was by no means  willing to yield to it, was apparent from his reluctance to quit the  spot; from the tardy steps with which he often left it, still looking  over his shoulder at the same window; and from the precipitation with  which he as often returned, when a fancied noise or the changing and  imperfect light induced him to suppose it had been softly raised.
  At  length, he gave the matter up, as hopeless for that night, and suddenly  breaking into a run as though to force himself away, scampered off at  his utmost speed, nor once ventured to look behind him lest he should  be tempted back again.
    Without relaxing his pace, or stopping to take breath, this mysterious  individual dashed on through a great many alleys and narrow ways until  he at length arrived in a square paved court, when he subsided into a  walk, and making for a small house from the window of which a light was  shining, lifted the latch of the door and passed in.
    'Bless us!' cried a woman turning sharply round, 'who's that?  Oh!  It's you, Kit!'    'Yes, mother, it's me.
'    'Why, how tired you look, my dear!'    'Old master an't gone out to-night,' said Kit; 'and so she hasn't been  at the window at all.
'  With which words, he sat down by the fire and  looked very mournful and discontented.
    The room in which Kit sat himself down, in this condition, was an  extremely poor and homely place, but with that air of comfort about it,  nevertheless, which--or the spot must be a wretched one  indeed--cleanliness and order can always impart in some degree.
  Late  as the Dutch clock showed it to be, the poor woman was still hard at  work at an ironing-table; a young child lay sleeping in a cradle near  the fire; and another, a sturdy boy of two or three years old, very  wide awake, with a very tight night-cap on his head, and a night-gown  very much too small for him on his body, was sitting bolt upright in a  clothes-basket, staring over the rim with his great round eyes, and  looking as if he had thoroughly made up his mind never to go to sleep  any more; which, as he had already declined to take his natural rest  and had been brought out of bed in consequence, opened a cheerful  prospect for his relations and friends.
  It was rather a queer-looking  family: Kit, his mother, and the children, being all strongly alike.
    Kit was disposed to be out of temper, as the best of us are too  often--but he looked at the youngest child who was sleeping soundly,  and from him to his other brother in the clothes-basket, and from him  to their mother, who had been at work without complaint since morning,  and thought it would be a better and kinder thing to be good-humoured.
  So he rocked the cradle with his foot; made a face at the rebel in the  clothes-basket, which put him in high good-humour directly; and stoutly  determined to be talkative and make himself agreeable.
    'Ah, mother!' said Kit, taking out his clasp-knife, and falling upon a  great piece of bread and meat which she had had ready for him, hours  before, 'what a one you are!  There an't many such as you, I know.
'    'I hope there are many a great deal better, Kit,' said Mrs Nubbles;  'and that there are, or ought to be, accordin' to what the parson at  chapel says.
'    'Much he knows about it,' returned Kit contemptuously.
  'Wait till he's  a widder and works like you do, and gets as little, and does as much,  and keeps his spirit up the same, and then I'll ask him what's o'clock  and trust him for being right to half a second.
'    'Well,' said Mrs Nubbles, evading the point, 'your beer's down there by  the fender, Kit.
'    'I see,' replied her son, taking up the porter pot, 'my love to you,  mother.
  And the parson's health too if you like.
  I don't bear him any  malice, not I!'    'Did you tell me, just now, that your master hadn't gone out to-night?'  inquired Mrs Nubbles.
    'Yes,' said Kit, 'worse luck!'    'You should say better luck, I think,' returned his mother, 'because  Miss Nelly won't have been left alone.
'    'Ah!' said Kit, 'I forgot that.
  I said worse luck, because I've been  watching ever since eight o'clock, and seen nothing of her.
'    'I wonder what she'd say,' cried his mother, stopping in her work and  looking round, 'if she knew that every night, when she--poor thing--is  sitting alone at that window, you are watching in the open street for  fear any harm should come to her, and that you never leave the place or  come home to your bed though you're ever so tired, till such time as  you think she's safe in hers.
'    'Never mind what she'd say,' replied Kit, with something like a blush  on his uncouth face; 'she'll never know nothing, and consequently,  she'll never say nothing.
'    Mrs Nubbles ironed away in silence for a minute or two, and coming to  the fireplace for another iron, glanced stealthily at Kit while she  rubbed it on a board and dusted it with a duster, but said nothing  until she had returned to her table again: when, holding the iron at an  alarmingly short distance from her cheek, to test its temperature, and  looking round with a smile, she observed:    'I know what some people would say, Kit--'    'Nonsense,' interposed Kit with a perfect apprehension of what was to  follow.
    'No, but they would indeed.
  Some people would say that you'd fallen in  love with her, I know they would.
'    To this, Kit only replied by bashfully bidding his mother 'get out,'  and forming sundry strange figures with his legs and arms, accompanied  by sympathetic contortions of his face.
  Not deriving from these means  the relief which he sought, he bit off an immense mouthful from the  bread and meat, and took a quick drink of the porter; by which  artificial aids he choked himself and effected a diversion of the  subject.
    'Speaking seriously though, Kit,' said his mother, taking up the theme  afresh, after a time, 'for of course I was only in joke just now, it's  very good and thoughtful, and like you, to do this, and never let  anybody know it, though some day I hope she may come to know it, for  I'm sure she would be very grateful to you and feel it very much.
  It's  a cruel thing to keep the dear child shut up there.
  I don't wonder  that the old gentleman wants to keep it from you.
'    'He don't think it's cruel, bless you,' said Kit, 'and don't mean it to  be so, or he wouldn't do it--I do consider, mother, that he wouldn't do  it for all the gold and silver in the world.
  No, no, that he wouldn't.
  I know him better than that.
'    'Then what does he do it for, and why does he keep it so close from  you?' said Mrs Nubbles.
    'That I don't know,' returned her son.
  'If he hadn't tried to keep it  so close though, I should never have found it out, for it was his  getting me away at night and sending me off so much earlier than he  used to, that first made me curious to know what was going on.
  Hark!  what's that?'    'It's only somebody outside.
'    'It's somebody crossing over here,' said Kit, standing up to listen,  'and coming very fast too.
  He can't have gone out after I left, and  the house caught fire, mother!'    The boy stood, for a moment, really bereft, by the apprehension he had  conjured up, of the power to move.
  The footsteps drew nearer, the door  was opened with a hasty hand, and the child herself, pale and  breathless, and hastily wrapped in a few disordered garments, hurried  into the room.
    'Miss Nelly!  What is the matter!' cried mother and son together.
    'I must not stay a moment,' she returned, 'grandfather has been taken  very ill.
  I found him in a fit upon the floor--'    'I'll run for a doctor'--said Kit, seizing his brimless hat.
  'I'll be  there directly, I'll--'    'No, no,' cried Nell, 'there is one there, you're not wanted,  you--you--must never come near us any more!'    'What!' roared Kit.
    'Never again,' said the child.
  'Don't ask me why, for I don't know.
  Pray don't ask me why, pray don't be sorry, pray don't be vexed with  me!  I have nothing to do with it indeed!'    Kit looked at her with his eyes stretched wide; and opened and shut his  mouth a great many times; but couldn't get out one word.
    'He complains and raves of you,' said the child, 'I don't know what you  have done, but I hope it's nothing very bad.
'    'I done!' roared Kit.
    'He cried that you're the cause of all his misery,' returned the child  with tearful eyes; 'he screamed and called for you; they say you must  not come near him or he will die.
  You must not return to us any more.
  I came to tell you.
  I thought it would be better that I should come  than somebody quite strange.
  Oh, Kit, what have you done?  You, in  whom I trusted so much, and who were almost the only friend I had!'    The unfortunate Kit looked at his young mistress harder and harder, and  with eyes growing wider and wider, but was perfectly motionless and  silent.
    'I have brought his money for the week,' said the child, looking to the  woman and laying it on the table--'and--and--a little more, for he was  always good and kind to me.
  I hope he will be sorry and do well  somewhere else and not take this to heart too much.
  It grieves me very  much to part with him like this, but there is no help.
  It must be  done.
  Good night!'    With the tears streaming down her face, and her slight figure trembling  with the agitation of the scene she had left, the shock she had  received, the errand she had just discharged, and a thousand painful  and affectionate feelings, the child hastened to the door, and  disappeared as rapidly as she had come.
    The poor woman, who had no cause to doubt her son, but every reason for  relying on his honesty and truth, was staggered, notwithstanding, by  his not having advanced one word in his defence.
  Visions of gallantry,  knavery, robbery; and of the nightly absences from home for which he  had accounted so strangely, having been occasioned by some unlawful  pursuit; flocked into her brain and rendered her afraid to question  him.
  She rocked herself upon a chair, wringing her hands and weeping  bitterly, but Kit made no attempt to comfort her and remained quite  bewildered.
  The baby in the cradle woke up and cried; the boy in the  clothes-basket fell over on his back with the basket upon him, and was  seen no more; the mother wept louder yet and rocked faster; but Kit,  insensible to all the din and tumult, remained in a state of utter  stupefaction.
              Quiet and solitude were destined to hold uninterrupted rule no longer,  beneath the roof that sheltered the child.
  Next morning, the old man  was in a raging fever accompanied with delirium; and sinking under the  influence of this disorder he lay for many weeks in imminent peril of  his life.
  There was watching enough, now, but it was the watching of  strangers who made a greedy trade of it, and who, in the intervals in  their attendance upon the sick man huddled together with a ghastly  good-fellowship, and ate and drank and made merry; for disease and  death were their ordinary household gods.
    Yet, in all the hurry and crowding of such a time, the child was more  alone than she had ever been before; alone in spirit, alone in her  devotion to him who was wasting away upon his burning bed; alone in her  unfeigned sorrow, and her unpurchased sympathy.
  Day after day, and  night after night, found her still by the pillow of the unconscious  sufferer, still anticipating his every want, still listening to those  repetitions of her name and those anxieties and cares for her, which  were ever uppermost among his feverish wanderings.
    The house was no longer theirs.
  Even the sick chamber seemed to be  retained, on the uncertain tenure of Mr Quilp's favour.
  The old man's  illness had not lasted many days when he took formal possession of the  premises and all upon them, in virtue of certain legal powers to that  effect, which few understood and none presumed to call in question.
  This important step secured, with the assistance of a man of law whom  he brought with him for the purpose, the dwarf proceeded to establish  himself and his coadjutor in the house, as an assertion of his claim  against all comers; and then set about making his quarters comfortable,  after his own fashion.
    To this end, Mr Quilp encamped in the back parlour, having first put an  effectual stop to any further business by shutting up the shop.
  Having  looked out, from among the old furniture, the handsomest and most  commodious chair he could possibly find (which he reserved for his own  use) and an especially hideous and uncomfortable one (which he  considerately appropriated to the accommodation of his friend) he  caused them to be carried into this room, and took up his position in  great state.
  The apartment was very far removed from the old man's  chamber, but Mr Quilp deemed it prudent, as a precaution against  infection from fever, and a means of wholesome fumigation, not only to  smoke, himself, without cessation, but to insist upon it that his legal  friend did the like.
  Moreover, he sent an express to the wharf for the  tumbling boy, who arriving with all despatch was enjoined to sit  himself down in another chair just inside the door, continually to  smoke a great pipe which the dwarf had provided for the purpose, and to  take it from his lips under any pretence whatever, were it only for one  minute at a time, if he dared.
  These arrangements completed, Mr Quilp  looked round him with chuckling satisfaction, and remarked that he  called that comfort.
    The legal gentleman, whose melodious name was Brass, might have called  it comfort also but for two drawbacks: one was, that he could by no  exertion sit easy in his chair, the seat of which was very hard,  angular, slippery, and sloping; the other, that tobacco-smoke always  caused him great internal discomposure and annoyance.
  But as he was  quite a creature of Mr Quilp's and had a thousand reasons for  conciliating his good opinion, he tried to smile, and nodded his  acquiescence with the best grace he could assume.
    This Brass was an attorney of no very good repute, from Bevis Marks in  the city of London; he was a tall, meagre man, with a nose like a wen,  a protruding forehead, retreating eyes, and hair of a deep red.
  He  wore a long black surtout reaching nearly to his ankles, short black  trousers, high shoes, and cotton stockings of a bluish grey.
  He had a  cringing manner, but a very harsh voice; and his blandest smiles were  so extremely forbidding, that to have had his company under the least  repulsive circumstances, one would have wished him to be out of temper  that he might only scowl.
    Quilp looked at his legal adviser, and seeing that he was winking very  much in the anguish of his pipe, that he sometimes shuddered when he  happened to inhale its full flavour, and that he constantly fanned the  smoke from him, was quite overjoyed and rubbed his hands with glee.
    'Smoke away, you dog,' said Quilp, turning to the boy; 'fill your pipe  again and smoke it fast, down to the last whiff, or I'll put the  sealing-waxed end of it in the fire and rub it red hot upon your  tongue.
'    Luckily the boy was case-hardened, and would have smoked a small  lime-kiln if anybody had treated him with it.
  Wherefore, he only  muttered a brief defiance of his master, and did as he was ordered.
    'Is it good, Brass, is it nice, is it fragrant, do you feel like the  Grand Turk?' said Quilp.
    Mr Brass thought that if he did, the Grand Turk's feelings were by no  means to be envied, but he said it was famous, and he had no doubt he  felt very like that Potentate.
    'This is the way to keep off fever,' said Quilp, 'this is the way to  keep off every calamity of life!  We'll never leave off, all the time  we stop here--smoke away, you dog, or you shall swallow the pipe!'    'Shall we stop here long, Mr Quilp?' inquired his legal friend, when  the dwarf had given his boy this gentle admonition.
    'We must stop, I suppose, till the old gentleman up stairs is dead,'  returned Quilp.
    'He he he!' laughed Mr Brass, 'oh! very good!'    'Smoke away!' cried Quilp.
  'Never stop!  You can talk as you smoke.
  Don't lose time.
'    'He he he!' cried Brass faintly, as he again applied himself to the  odious pipe.
  'But if he should get better, Mr Quilp?'    'Then we shall stop till he does, and no longer,' returned the dwarf.
    'How kind it is of you, Sir, to wait till then!' said Brass.
  'Some  people, Sir, would have sold or removed the goods--oh dear, the very  instant the law allowed 'em.
  Some people, Sir, would have been all  flintiness and granite.
  Some people, sir, would have--'    'Some people would have spared themselves the jabbering of such a  parrot as you,' interposed the dwarf.
    'He he he!' cried Brass.
  'You have such spirits!'    The smoking sentinel at the door interposed in this place, and without  taking his pipe from his lips, growled,    'Here's the gal a comin' down.
'    'The what, you dog?' said Quilp.
    'The gal,' returned the boy.
  'Are you deaf?'    'Oh!' said Quilp, drawing in his breath with great relish as if he were  taking soup, 'you and I will have such a settling presently; there's  such a scratching and bruising in store for you, my dear young friend!  Aha! Nelly!  How is he now, my duck of diamonds?'    'He's very bad,' replied the weeping child.
    'What a pretty little Nell!' cried Quilp.
    'Oh beautiful, sir, beautiful indeed,' said Brass.
  'Quite charming.
'    'Has she come to sit upon Quilp's knee,' said the dwarf, in what he  meant to be a soothing tone, 'or is she going to bed in her own little  room inside here?  Which is poor Nelly going to do?'    'What a remarkable pleasant way he has with children!' muttered Brass,  as if in confidence between himself and the ceiling; 'upon my word it's  quite a treat to hear him.
'    'I'm not going to stay at all,' faltered Nell.
  'I want a few things  out of that room, and then I--I--won't come down here any more.
'    'And a very nice little room it is!' said the dwarf looking into it as  the child entered.
  'Quite a bower!  You're sure you're not going to  use it; you're sure you're not coming back, Nelly?'    'No,' replied the child, hurrying away, with the few articles of dress  she had come to remove; 'never again!  Never again.
'    'She's very sensitive,' said Quilp, looking after her.
  'Very  sensitive; that's a pity.
  The bedstead is much about my size.
  I think  I shall make it MY little room.
'    Mr Brass encouraging this idea, as he would have encouraged any other  emanating from the same source, the dwarf walked in to try the effect.
  This he did, by throwing himself on his back upon the bed with his pipe  in his mouth, and then kicking up his legs and smoking violently.
  Mr  Brass applauding this picture very much, and the bed being soft and  comfortable, Mr Quilp determined to use it, both as a sleeping place by  night and as a kind of Divan by day; and in order that it might be  converted to the latter purpose at once, remained where he was, and  smoked his pipe out.
  The legal gentleman being by this time rather  giddy and perplexed in his ideas (for this was one of the operations of  the tobacco on his nervous system), took the opportunity of slinking  away into the open air, where, in course of time, he recovered  sufficiently to return with a countenance of tolerable composure.
  He  was soon led on by the malicious dwarf to smoke himself into a relapse,  and in that state stumbled upon a settee where he slept till morning.
    Such were Mr Quilp's first proceedings on entering upon his new  property.
  He was, for some days, restrained by business from  performing any particular pranks, as his time was pretty well occupied  between taking, with the assistance of Mr Brass, a minute inventory of  all the goods in the place, and going abroad upon his other concerns  which happily engaged him for several hours at a time.
  His avarice and  caution being, now, thoroughly awakened, however, he was never absent  from the house one night; and his eagerness for some termination, good  or bad, to the old man's disorder, increasing rapidly, as the time  passed by, soon began to vent itself in open murmurs and exclamations  of impatience.
    Nell shrank timidly from all the dwarf's advances towards conversation,  and fled from the very sound of his voice; nor were the lawyer's smiles  less terrible to her than Quilp's grimaces.
  She lived in such  continual dread and apprehension of meeting one or other of them on the  stairs or in the passages if she stirred from her grandfather's  chamber, that she seldom left it, for a moment, until late at night,  when the silence encouraged her to venture forth and breathe the purer  air of some empty room.
    One night, she had stolen to her usual window, and was sitting there  very sorrowfully--for the old man had been worse that day--when she  thought she heard her name pronounced by a voice in the street.
  Looking down, she recognised Kit, whose endeavours to attract her  attention had roused her from her sad reflections.
    'Miss Nell!' said the boy in a low voice.
    'Yes,' replied the child, doubtful whether she ought to hold any  communication with the supposed culprit, but inclining to her old  favourite still; 'what do you want?'    'I have wanted to say a word to you, for a long time,' the boy replied,  'but the people below have driven me away and wouldn't let me see you.
  You don't believe--I hope you don't really believe--that I deserve to  be cast off as I have been; do you, miss?'    'I must believe it,' returned the child.
  'Or why would grandfather  have been so angry with you?'    'I don't know,' replied Kit.
  'I'm sure I never deserved it from him,  no, nor from you.
  I can say that, with a true and honest heart, any  way.
  And then to be driven from the door, when I only came to ask how  old master was--!'    'They never told me that,' said the child.
  'I didn't know it indeed.
  I wouldn't have had them do it for the world.
'    'Thank'ee, miss,' returned Kit, 'it's comfortable to hear you say that.
  I said I never would believe that it was your doing.
'    'That was right!' said the child eagerly.
    'Miss Nell,' cried the boy coming under the window, and speaking in a  lower tone, 'there are new masters down stairs.
  It's a change for you.
'    'It is indeed,' replied the child.
    'And so it will be for him when he gets better,' said the boy, pointing  towards the sick room.
    '--If he ever does,' added the child, unable to restrain her tears.
    'Oh, he'll do that, he'll do that,' said Kit.
  'I'm sure he will.
  You  mustn't be cast down, Miss Nell.
  Now don't be, pray!'    These words of encouragement and consolation were few and roughly said,  but they affected the child and made her, for the moment, weep the more.
    'He'll be sure to get better now,' said the boy anxiously, 'if you  don't give way to low spirits and turn ill yourself, which would make  him worse and throw him back, just as he was recovering.
  When he does,  say a good word--say a kind word for me, Miss Nell!'    'They tell me I must not even mention your name to him for a long, long  time,' rejoined the child, 'I dare not; and even if I might, what good  would a kind word do you, Kit?  We shall be very poor.
  We shall  scarcely have bread to eat.
'    'It's not that I may be taken back,' said the boy, 'that I ask the  favour of you.
  It isn't for the sake of food and wages that I've been  waiting about so long in hopes to see you.
  Don't think that I'd come  in a time of trouble to talk of such things as them.
'    The child looked gratefully and kindly at him, but waited that he might  speak again.
    'No, it's not that,' said Kit hesitating, 'it's something very  different from that.
  I haven't got much sense, I know, but if he could  be brought to believe that I'd been a faithful servant to him, doing  the best I could, and never meaning harm, perhaps he mightn't--'    Here Kit faltered so long that the child entreated him to speak out,  and quickly, for it was very late, and time to shut the window.
    'Perhaps he mightn't think it over venturesome of me to say--well then,  to say this,' cried Kit with sudden boldness.
  'This home is gone from  you and him.
  Mother and I have got a poor one, but that's better than  this with all these people here; and why not come there, till he's had  time to look about, and find a better!'    The child did not speak.
  Kit, in the relief of having made his  proposition, found his tongue loosened, and spoke out in its favour  with his utmost eloquence.
    'You think,' said the boy, 'that it's very small and inconvenient.
  So  it is, but it's very clean.
  Perhaps you think it would be noisy, but  there's not a quieter court than ours in all the town.
  Don't be afraid  of the children; the baby hardly ever cries, and the other one is very  good--besides, I'd mind 'em.
  They wouldn't vex you much, I'm sure.
  Do  try, Miss Nell, do try.
  The little front room up stairs is very  pleasant.
  You can see a piece of the church-clock, through the  chimneys, and almost tell the time; mother says it would be just the  thing for you, and so it would, and you'd have her to wait upon you  both, and me to run of errands.
  We don't mean money, bless you; you're  not to think of that!  Will you try him, Miss Nell?  Only say you'll  try him.
  Do try to make old master come, and ask him first what I have  done.
  Will you only promise that, Miss Nell?'    Before the child could reply to this earnest solicitation, the  street-door opened, and Mr Brass thrusting out his night-capped head  called in a surly voice, 'Who's there!'  Kit immediately glided away,  and Nell, closing the window softly, drew back into the room.
    Before Mr Brass had repeated his inquiry many times, Mr Quilp, also  embellished with a night-cap, emerged from the same door and looked  carefully up and down the street, and up at all the windows of the  house, from the opposite side.
  Finding that there was nobody in sight,  he presently returned into the house with his legal friend, protesting  (as the child heard from the staircase), that there was a league and  plot against him; that he was in danger of being robbed and plundered  by a band of conspirators who prowled about the house at all seasons;  and that he would delay no longer but take immediate steps for  disposing of the property and returning to his own peaceful roof.
  Having growled forth these, and a great many other threats of the same  nature, he coiled himself once more in the child's little bed, and Nell  crept softly up the stairs.
    It was natural enough that her short and unfinished dialogue with Kit  should leave a strong impression on her mind, and influence her dreams  that night and her recollections for a long, long time.
  Surrounded by  unfeeling creditors, and mercenary attendants upon the sick, and  meeting in the height of her anxiety and sorrow with little regard or  sympathy even from the women about her, it is not surprising that the  affectionate heart of the child should have been touched to the quick  by one kind and generous spirit, however uncouth the temple in which it  dwelt.
  Thank Heaven that the temples of such spirits are not made with  hands, and that they may be even more worthily hung with poor  patch-work than with purple and fine linen!              At length, the crisis of the old man's disorder was past, and he began  to mend.
  By very slow and feeble degrees his consciousness came back;  but the mind was weakened and its functions were impaired.
  He was  patient, and quiet; often sat brooding, but not despondently, for a  long space; was easily amused, even by a sun-beam on the wall or  ceiling; made no complaint that the days were long, or the nights  tedious; and appeared indeed to have lost all count of time, and every  sense of care or weariness.
  He would sit, for hours together, with  Nell's small hand in his, playing with the fingers and stopping  sometimes to smooth her hair or kiss her brow; and, when he saw that  tears were glistening in her eyes, would look, amazed, about him for  the cause, and forget his wonder even while he looked.
    The child and he rode out; the old man propped up with pillows, and the  child beside him.
  They were hand in hand as usual.
  The noise and  motion in the streets fatigued his brain at first, but he was not  surprised, or curious, or pleased, or irritated.
  He was asked if he  remembered this, or that.
  'O yes,' he said, 'quite well--why not?'  Sometimes he turned his head, and looked, with earnest gaze and  outstretched neck, after some stranger in the crowd, until he  disappeared from sight; but, to the question why he did this, he  answered not a word.
    He was sitting in his easy chair one day, and Nell upon a stool beside  him, when a man outside the door inquired if he might enter.
  'Yes,' he  said without emotion, 'it was Quilp, he knew.
  Quilp was master there.
  Of course he might come in.
'  And so he did.
    'I'm glad to see you well again at last, neighbour,' said the dwarf,  sitting down opposite him.
  'You're quite strong now?'    'Yes,' said the old man feebly, 'yes.
'    'I don't want to hurry you, you know, neighbour,' said the dwarf,  raising his voice, for the old man's senses were duller than they had  been; 'but, as soon as you can arrange your future proceedings, the  better.
'    'Surely,' said the old man.
  'The better for all parties.
'    'You see,' pursued Quilp after a short pause, 'the goods being once  removed, this house would be uncomfortable; uninhabitable in fact.
'    'You say true,' returned the old man.
  'Poor Nell too, what would she  do?'    'Exactly,' bawled the dwarf nodding his head; 'that's very well  observed.
  Then will you consider about it, neighbour?'    'I will, certainly,' replied the old man.
  'We shall not stop here.
'    'So I supposed,' said the dwarf.
  'I have sold the things.
  They have  not yielded quite as much as they might have done, but pretty  well--pretty well.
  To-day's Tuesday.
  When shall they be moved?  There's no hurry--shall we say this afternoon?'    'Say Friday morning,' returned the old man.
    'Very good,' said the dwarf.
  'So be it--with the understanding that I  can't go beyond that day, neighbour, on any account.
'    'Good,' returned the old man.
  'I shall remember it.
'    Mr Quilp seemed rather puzzled by the strange, even spiritless way in  which all this was said; but as the old man nodded his head and  repeated 'on Friday morning.
  I shall remember it,' he had no excuse  for dwelling on the subject any further, and so took a friendly leave  with many expressions of good-will and many compliments to his friend  on his looking so remarkably well; and went below stairs to report  progress to Mr Brass.
    All that day, and all the next, the old man remained in this state.
  He  wandered up and down the house and into and out of the various rooms,  as if with some vague intent of bidding them adieu, but he referred  neither by direct allusions nor in any other manner to the interview of  the morning or the necessity of finding some other shelter.
  An  indistinct idea he had, that the child was desolate and in want of  help; for he often drew her to his bosom and bade her be of good cheer,  saying that they would not desert each other; but he seemed unable to  contemplate their real position more distinctly, and was still the  listless, passionless creature that suffering of mind and body had left  him.
    We call this a state of childishness, but it is the same poor hollow  mockery of it, that death is of sleep.
  Where, in the dull eyes of  doating men, are the laughing light and life of childhood, the gaiety  that has known no check, the frankness that has felt no chill, the hope  that has never withered, the joys that fade in blossoming?  Where, in  the sharp lineaments of rigid and unsightly death, is the calm beauty  of slumber, telling of rest for the waking hours that are past, and  gentle hopes and loves for those which are to come?  Lay death and  sleep down, side by side, and say who shall find the two akin.
  Send  forth the child and childish man together, and blush for the pride that  libels our own old happy state, and gives its title to an ugly and  distorted image.
    Thursday arrived, and there was no alteration in the old man.
  But a  change came upon him that evening as he and the child sat silently  together.
    In a small dull yard below his window, there was a tree--green and  flourishing enough, for such a place--and as the air stirred among its  leaves, it threw a rippling shadow on the white wall.
  The old man sat  watching the shadows as they trembled in this patch of light, until the  sun went down; and when it was night, and the moon was slowly rising,  he still sat in the same spot.
    To one who had been tossing on a restless bed so long, even these few  green leaves and this tranquil light, although it languished among  chimneys and house-tops, were pleasant things.
  They suggested quiet  places afar off, and rest, and peace.
  The child thought, more than  once that he was moved: and had forborne to speak.
  But now he shed  tears--tears that it lightened her aching heart to see--and making as  though he would fall upon his knees, besought her to forgive him.
    'Forgive you--what?' said Nell, interposing to prevent his purpose.
  'Oh grandfather, what should I forgive?'    'All that is past, all that has come upon thee, Nell, all that was done  in that uneasy dream,' returned the old man.
    'Do not talk so,' said the child.
  'Pray do not.
  Let us speak of  something else.
'    'Yes, yes, we will,' he rejoined.
  'And it shall be of what we talked  of long ago--many months--months is it, or weeks, or days?  which is it  Nell?'    'I do not understand you,' said the child.
    'It has come back upon me to-day, it has all come back since we have  been sitting here.
  I bless thee for it, Nell!'    'For what, dear grandfather?'    'For what you said when we were first made beggars, Nell.
  Let us speak  softly.
  Hush!  for if they knew our purpose down stairs, they would  cry that I was mad and take thee from me.
  We will not stop here  another day.
  We will go far away from here.
'    'Yes, let us go,' said the child earnestly.
  'Let us begone from this  place, and never turn back or think of it again.
  Let us wander  barefoot through the world, rather than linger here.
'    'We will,' answered the old man, 'we will travel afoot through the  fields and woods, and by the side of rivers, and trust ourselves to God  in the places where He dwells.
  It is far better to lie down at night  beneath an open sky like that yonder--see how bright it is--than to  rest in close rooms which are always full of care and weary dreams.
  Thou and I together, Nell, may be cheerful and happy yet, and learn to  forget this time, as if it had never been.
'    'We will be happy,' cried the child.
  'We never can be here.
'    'No, we never can again--never again--that's truly said,' rejoined the  old man.
  'Let us steal away to-morrow morning--early and softly, that  we may not be seen or heard--and leave no trace or track for them to  follow by.
  Poor Nell!  Thy cheek is pale, and thy eyes are heavy with  watching and weeping for me--I know--for me; but thou wilt be well  again, and merry too, when we are far away.
  To-morrow morning, dear,  we'll turn our faces from this scene of sorrow, and be as free and  happy as the birds.
'    And then the old man clasped his hands above her head, and said, in a  few broken words, that from that time forth they would wander up and  down together, and never part more until Death took one or other of the  twain.
    The child's heart beat high with hope and confidence.
  She had no  thought of hunger, or cold, or thirst, or suffering.
  She saw in this,  but a return of the simple pleasures they had once enjoyed, a relief  from the gloomy solitude in which she had lived, an escape from the  heartless people by whom she had been surrounded in her late time of  trial, the restoration of the old man's health and peace, and a life of  tranquil happiness.
  Sun, and stream, and meadow, and summer days,  shone brightly in her view, and there was no dark tint in all the  sparkling picture.
    The old man had slept, for some hours, soundly in his bed, and she was  yet busily engaged in preparing for their flight.
  There were a few  articles of clothing for herself to carry, and a few for him; old  garments, such as became their fallen fortunes, laid out to wear; and a  staff to support his feeble steps, put ready for his use.
  But this was  not all her task; for now she must visit the old rooms for the last  time.
    And how different the parting with them was, from any she had expected,  and most of all from that which she had oftenest pictured to herself.
  How could she ever have thought of bidding them farewell in triumph,  when the recollection of the many hours she had passed among them rose  to her swelling heart, and made her feel the wish a cruelty: lonely and  sad though many of those hours had been!  She sat down at the window  where she had spent so many evenings--darker far than this--and every  thought of hope or cheerfulness that had occurred to her in that place  came vividly upon her mind, and blotted out all its dull and mournful  associations in an instant.
    Her own little room too, where she had so often knelt down and prayed  at night--prayed for the time which she hoped was dawning now--the  little room where she had slept so peacefully, and dreamed such  pleasant dreams!  It was hard not to be able to glance round it once  more, and to be forced to leave it without one kind look or grateful  tear.
  There were some trifles there--poor useless things--that she  would have liked to take away; but that was impossible.
    This brought to mind her bird, her poor bird, who hung there yet.
  She  wept bitterly for the loss of this little creature--until the idea  occurred to her--she did not know how, or why, it came into her  head--that it might, by some means, fall into the hands of Kit who  would keep it for her sake, and think, perhaps, that she had left it  behind in the hope that he might have it, and as an assurance that she  was grateful to him.
  She was calmed and comforted by the thought, and  went to rest with a lighter heart.
    From many dreams of rambling through light and sunny places, but with  some vague object unattained which ran indistinctly through them all,  she awoke to find that it was yet night, and that the stars were  shining brightly in the sky.
  At length, the day began to glimmer, and  the stars to grow pale and dim.
  As soon as she was sure of this, she  arose, and dressed herself for the journey.
    The old man was yet asleep, and as she was unwilling to disturb him,  she left him to slumber on, until the sun rose.
  He was anxious that  they should leave the house without a minute's loss of time, and was  soon ready.
    The child then took him by the hand, and they trod lightly and  cautiously down the stairs, trembling whenever a board creaked, and  often stopping to listen.
  The old man had forgotten a kind of wallet  which contained the light burden he had to carry; and the going back a  few steps to fetch it seemed an interminable delay.
    At last they reached the passage on the ground floor, where the snoring  of Mr Quilp and his legal friend sounded more terrible in their ears  than the roars of lions.
  The bolts of the door were rusty, and  difficult to unfasten without noise.
  When they were all drawn back, it  was found to be locked, and worst of all, the key was gone.
  Then the  child remembered, for the first time, one of the nurses having told her  that Quilp always locked both the house-doors at night, and kept the  keys on the table in his bedroom.
    It was not without great fear and trepidation that little Nell slipped  off her shoes and gliding through the store-room of old curiosities,  where Mr Brass--the ugliest piece of goods in all the stock--lay  sleeping on a mattress, passed into her own little chamber.
    Here she stood, for a few moments, quite transfixed with terror at the  sight of Mr Quilp, who was hanging so far out of bed that he almost  seemed to be standing on his head, and who, either from the uneasiness  of this posture, or in one of his agreeable habits, was gasping and  growling with his mouth wide open, and the whites (or rather the dirty  yellows) of his eyes distinctly visible.
  It was no time, however, to  ask whether anything ailed him; so, possessing herself of the key after  one hasty glance about the room, and repassing the prostrate Mr Brass,  she rejoined the old man in safety.
  They got the door open without  noise, and passing into the street, stood still.
    'Which way?' said the child.
    The old man looked, irresolutely and helplessly, first at her, then to  the right and left, then at her again, and shook his head.
  It was  plain that she was thenceforth his guide and leader.
  The child felt  it, but had no doubts or misgiving, and putting her hand in his, led  him gently away.
    It was the beginning of a day in June; the deep blue sky unsullied by a  cloud, and teeming with brilliant light.
  The streets were, as yet,  nearly free from passengers, the houses and shops were closed, and the  healthy air of morning fell like breath from angels, on the sleeping  town.
    The old man and the child passed on through the glad silence, elate  with hope and pleasure.
  They were alone together, once again; every  object was bright and fresh; nothing reminded them, otherwise than by  contrast, of the monotony and constraint they had left behind; church  towers and steeples, frowning and dark at other times, now shone in the  sun; each humble nook and corner rejoiced in light; and the sky, dimmed  only by excessive distance, shed its placid smile on everything beneath.
    Forth from the city, while it yet slumbered, went the two poor  adventurers, wandering they knew not whither.
              Daniel Quilp of Tower Hill, and Sampson Brass of Bevis Marks in the  city of London, Gentleman, one of her Majesty's attornies of the Courts  of the King's Bench and Common Pleas at Westminster and a solicitor of  the High Court of Chancery, slumbered on, unconscious and unsuspicious  of any mischance, until a knocking on the street door, often repeated  and gradually mounting up from a modest single rap to a perfect battery  of knocks, fired in long discharges with a very short interval between,  caused the said Daniel Quilp to struggle into a horizontal position,  and to stare at the ceiling with a drowsy indifference, betokening that  he heard the noise and rather wondered at the same, and couldn't be at  the trouble of bestowing any further thought upon the subject.
    As the knocking, however, instead of accommodating itself to his lazy  state, increased in vigour and became more importunate, as if in  earnest remonstrance against his falling asleep again, now that he had  once opened his eyes, Daniel Quilp began by degrees to comprehend the  possibility of there being somebody at the door; and thus he gradually  came to recollect that it was Friday morning, and he had ordered Mrs  Quilp to be in waiting upon him at an early hour.
    Mr Brass, after writhing about, in a great many strange attitudes, and  often twisting his face and eyes into an expression like that which is  usually produced by eating gooseberries very early in the season, was  by this time awake also.
  Seeing that Mr Quilp invested himself in his  every-day garments, he hastened to do the like, putting on his shoes  before his stockings, and thrusting his legs into his coat sleeves, and  making such other small mistakes in his toilet as are not uncommon to  those who dress in a hurry, and labour under the agitation of having  been suddenly roused.
    While the attorney was thus engaged, the dwarf was groping under the  table, muttering desperate imprecations on himself, and mankind in  general, and all inanimate objects to boot, which suggested to Mr Brass  the question, 'what's the matter?'    'The key,' said the dwarf, looking viciously about him, 'the  door-key--that's the matter.
  D'ye know anything of it?'    'How should I know anything of it, sir?' returned Mr Brass.
    'How should you?' repeated Quilp with a sneer.
  'You're a nice lawyer,  an't you?  Ugh, you idiot!'    Not caring to represent to the dwarf in his present humour, that the  loss of a key by another person could scarcely be said to affect his  (Brass's) legal knowledge in any material degree, Mr Brass humbly  suggested that it must have been forgotten over night, and was,  doubtless, at that moment in its native key-hole.
  Notwithstanding that  Mr Quilp had a strong conviction to the contrary, founded on his  recollection of having carefully taken it out, he was fain to admit  that this was possible, and therefore went grumbling to the door where,  sure enough, he found it.
    Now, just as Mr Quilp laid his hand upon the lock, and saw with great  astonishment that the fastenings were undone, the knocking came again  with the most irritating violence, and the daylight which had been  shining through the key-hole was intercepted on the outside by a human  eye.
  The dwarf was very much exasperated, and wanting somebody to  wreak his ill-humour upon, determined to dart out suddenly, and favour  Mrs Quilp with a gentle acknowledgment of her attention in making that  hideous uproar.
    With this view, he drew back the lock very silently and softly, and  opening the door all at once, pounced out upon the person on the other  side, who had at that moment raised the knocker for another  application, and at whom the dwarf ran head first: throwing out his  hands and feet together, and biting the air in the fulness of his  malice.
    So far, however, from rushing upon somebody who offered no resistance  and implored his mercy, Mr Quilp was no sooner in the arms of the  individual whom he had taken for his wife than he found himself  complimented with two staggering blows on the head, and two more, of  the same quality, in the chest; and closing with his assailant, such a  shower of buffets rained down upon his person as sufficed to convince  him that he was in skilful and experienced hands.
  Nothing daunted by  this reception, he clung tight to his opponent, and bit and hammered  away with such good-will and heartiness, that it was at least a couple  of minutes before he was dislodged.
  Then, and not until then, Daniel  Quilp found himself, all flushed and dishevelled, in the middle of the  street, with Mr Richard Swiveller performing a kind of dance round him  and requiring to know 'whether he wanted any more?'    'There's plenty more of it at the same shop,' said Mr Swiveller, by  turns advancing and retreating in a threatening attitude, 'a large and  extensive assortment always on hand--country orders executed with  promptitude and despatch--will you have a little more, Sir--don't say  no, if you'd rather not.
'    'I thought it was somebody else,' said Quilp, rubbing his shoulders,  'why didn't you say who you were?'    'Why didn't you say who YOU were?' returned Dick, 'instead of flying  out of the house like a Bedlamite?'    'It was you that--that knocked,' said the dwarf, getting up with a  short groan, 'was it?'    'Yes, I am the man,' replied Dick.
  'That lady had begun when I came,  but she knocked too soft, so I relieved her.
'  As he said this, he  pointed towards Mrs Quilp, who stood trembling at a little distance.
    'Humph!' muttered the dwarf, darting an angry look at his wife, 'I  thought it was your fault!  And you, sir--don't you know there has been  somebody ill here, that you knock as if you'd beat the door down?'    'Damme!' answered Dick, 'that's why I did it.
  I thought there was  somebody dead here.
'    'You came for some purpose, I suppose,' said Quilp.
  'What is it you  want?'    'I want to know how the old gentleman is,' rejoined Mr Swiveller, 'and  to hear from Nell herself, with whom I should like to have a little  talk.
  I'm a friend of the family, sir--at least I'm the friend of one  of the family, and that's the same thing.
'    'You'd better walk in then,' said the dwarf.
  'Go on, sir, go on.
  Now,  Mrs Quilp--after you, ma'am.
'    Mrs Quilp hesitated, but Mr Quilp insisted.
  And it was not a contest  of politeness, or by any means a matter of form, for she knew very well  that her husband wished to enter the house in this order, that he might  have a favourable opportunity of inflicting a few pinches on her arms,  which were seldom free from impressions of his fingers in black and  blue colours.
  Mr Swiveller, who was not in the secret, was a little  surprised to hear a suppressed scream, and, looking round, to see Mrs  Quilp following him with a sudden jerk; but he did not remark on these  appearances, and soon forgot them.
    'Now, Mrs Quilp,' said the dwarf when they had entered the shop, 'go  you up stairs, if you please, to Nelly's room, and tell her that she's  wanted.
'    'You seem to make yourself at home here,' said Dick, who was  unacquainted with Mr Quilp's authority.
    'I AM at home, young gentleman,' returned the dwarf.
    Dick was pondering what these words might mean, and still more what the  presence of Mr Brass might mean, when Mrs Quilp came hurrying down  stairs, declaring that the rooms above were empty.
    'Empty, you fool!' said the dwarf.
    'I give you my word, Quilp,' answered his trembling wife, 'that I have  been into every room and there's not a soul in any of them.
'    'And that,' said Mr Brass, clapping his hands once, with an emphasis,  'explains the mystery of the key!'    Quilp looked frowningly at him, and frowningly at his wife, and  frowningly at Richard Swiveller; but, receiving no enlightenment from  any of them, hurried up stairs, whence he soon hurried down again,  confirming the report which had already been made.
    'It's a strange way of going,' he said, glancing at Swiveller, 'very  strange not to communicate with me who am such a close and intimate  friend of his!  Ah! he'll write to me no doubt, or he'll bid Nelly  write--yes, yes, that's what he'll do.
  Nelly's very fond of me.
  Pretty Nell!'    Mr Swiveller looked, as he was, all open-mouthed astonishment.
  Still  glancing furtively at him, Quilp turned to Mr Brass and observed, with  assumed carelessness, that this need not interfere with the removal of  the goods.
    'For indeed,' he added, 'we knew that they'd go away to-day, but not  that they'd go so early, or so quietly.
  But they have their reasons,  they have their reasons.
'    'Where in the devil's name are they gone?' said the wondering Dick.
    Quilp shook his head, and pursed up his lips, in a manner which implied  that he knew very well, but was not at liberty to say.
    'And what,' said Dick, looking at the confusion about him, 'what do you  mean by moving the goods?'    'That I have bought 'em, Sir,' rejoined Quilp.
  'Eh?  What then?'    'Has the sly old fox made his fortune then, and gone to live in a  tranquil cot in a pleasant spot with a distant view of the changing  sea?' said Dick, in great bewilderment.
    'Keeping his place of retirement very close, that he may not be visited  too often by affectionate grandsons and their devoted friends, eh?'  added the dwarf, rubbing his hands hard; 'I say nothing, but is that  your meaning?'    Richard Swiveller was utterly aghast at this unexpected alteration of  circumstances, which threatened the complete overthrow of the project  in which he bore so conspicuous a part, and seemed to nip his prospects  in the bud.
  Having only received from Frederick Trent, late on the  previous night, information of the old man's illness, he had come upon  a visit of condolence and inquiry to Nell, prepared with the first  instalment of that long train of fascinations which was to fire her  heart at last.
  And here, when he had been thinking of all kinds of  graceful and insinuating approaches, and meditating on the fearful  retaliation which was slowly working against Sophy Wackles--here were  Nell, the old man, and all the money gone, melted away, decamped he  knew not whither, as if with a fore-knowledge of the scheme and a  resolution to defeat it in the very outset, before a step was taken.
    In his secret heart, Daniel Quilp was both surprised and troubled by  the flight which had been made.
  It had not escaped his keen eye that  some indispensable articles of clothing were gone with the fugitives,  and knowing the old man's weak state of mind, he marvelled what that  course of proceeding might be in which he had so readily procured the  concurrence of the child.
  It must not be supposed (or it would be a  gross injustice to Mr Quilp) that he was tortured by any disinterested  anxiety on behalf of either.
  His uneasiness arose from a misgiving  that the old man had some secret store of money which he had not  suspected; and the idea of its escaping his clutches, overwhelmed him  with mortification and self-reproach.
    In this frame of mind, it was some consolation to him to find that  Richard Swiveller was, for different reasons, evidently irritated and  disappointed by the same cause.
  It was plain, thought the dwarf, that  he had come there, on behalf of his friend, to cajole or frighten the  old man out of some small fraction of that wealth of which they  supposed him to have an abundance.
  Therefore, it was a relief to vex  his heart with a picture of the riches the old man hoarded, and to  expatiate on his cunning in removing himself even beyond the reach of  importunity.
    'Well,' said Dick, with a blank look, 'I suppose it's of no use my  staying here.
'    'Not the least in the world,' rejoined the dwarf.
    'You'll mention that I called, perhaps?' said Dick.
    Mr Quilp nodded, and said he certainly would, the very first time he  saw them.
    'And say,' added Mr Swiveller, 'say, sir, that I was wafted here upon  the pinions of concord; that I came to remove, with the rake of  friendship, the seeds of mutual violence and heart-burning, and to sow  in their place, the germs of social harmony.
  Will you have the  goodness to charge yourself with that commission, Sir?'    'Certainly!' rejoined Quilp.
    'Will you be kind enough to add to it, Sir,' said Dick, producing a  very small limp card, 'that that is my address, and that I am to be  found at home every morning.
  Two distinct knocks, sir, will produce  the slavey at any time.
  My particular friends, Sir, are accustomed to  sneeze when the door is opened, to give her to understand that they ARE  my friends and have no interested motives in asking if I'm at home.
  I  beg your pardon; will you allow me to look at that card again?'    'Oh! by all means,' rejoined Quilp.
    'By a slight and not unnatural mistake, sir,' said Dick, substituting  another in its stead, 'I had handed you the pass-ticket of a select  convivial circle called the Glorious Apollers of which I have the  honour to be Perpetual Grand.
  That is the proper document, Sir.
  Good  morning.
'    Quilp bade him good day; the perpetual Grand Master of the Glorious  Apollers, elevating his hat in honour of Mrs Quilp, dropped it  carelessly on the side of his head again, and disappeared with a  flourish.
    By this time, certain vans had arrived for the conveyance of the goods,  and divers strong men in caps were balancing chests of drawers and  other trifles of that nature upon their heads, and performing muscular  feats which heightened their complexions considerably.
  Not to be  behind-hand in the bustle, Mr Quilp went to work with surprising  vigour; hustling and driving the people about, like an evil spirit;  setting Mrs Quilp upon all kinds of arduous and impracticable tasks;  carrying great weights up and down, with no apparent effort; kicking  the boy from the wharf, whenever he could get near him; and inflicting,  with his loads, a great many sly bumps and blows on the shoulders of Mr  Brass, as he stood upon the door-steps to answer all the inquiries of  curious neighbours, which was his department.
  His presence and example  diffused such alacrity among the persons employed, that, in a few  hours, the house was emptied of everything, but pieces of matting,  empty porter-pots, and scattered fragments of straw.
    Seated, like an African chief, on one of these pieces of matting, the  dwarf was regaling himself in the parlour, with bread and cheese and  beer, when he observed without appearing to do so, that a boy was  prying in at the outer door.
  Assured that it was Kit, though he saw  little more than his nose, Mr Quilp hailed him by his name; whereupon  Kit came in and demanded what he wanted.
    'Come here, you sir,' said the dwarf.
  'Well, so your old master and  young mistress have gone?'    'Where?' rejoined Kit, looking round.
    'Do you mean to say you don't know where?' answered Quilp sharply.
  'Where have they gone, eh?'    'I don't know,' said Kit.
    'Come,' retorted Quilp, 'let's have no more of this!  Do you mean to  say that you don't know they went away by stealth, as soon as it was  light this morning?'    'No,' said the boy, in evident surprise.
    'You don't know that?' cried Quilp.
  'Don't I know that you were  hanging about the house the other night, like a thief, eh?  Weren't you  told then?'    'No,' replied the boy.
    'You were not?' said Quilp.
  'What were you told then; what were you  talking about?'    Kit, who knew no particular reason why he should keep the matter secret  now, related the purpose for which he had come on that occasion, and  the proposal he had made.
    'Oh!' said the dwarf after a little consideration.
  'Then, I think  they'll come to you yet.
'    'Do you think they will?' cried Kit eagerly.
    'Aye, I think they will,' returned the dwarf.
  'Now, when they do, let  me know; d'ye hear?  Let me know, and I'll give you something.
  I want  to do 'em a kindness, and I can't do 'em a kindness unless I know where  they are.
  You hear what I say?'    Kit might have returned some answer which would not have been agreeable  to his irascible questioner, if the boy from the wharf, who had been  skulking about the room in search of anything that might have been left  about by accident, had not happened to cry, 'Here's a bird!  What's to  be done with this?'    'Wring its neck,' rejoined Quilp.
    'Oh no, don't do that,' said Kit, stepping forward.
  'Give it to me.
'    'Oh yes, I dare say,' cried the other boy.
  'Come!  You let the cage  alone, and let me wring its neck will you?  He said I was to do it.
  You let the cage alone will you.
'    'Give it here, give it to me, you dogs,' roared Quilp.
  'Fight for it,  you dogs, or I'll wring its neck myself!'    Without further persuasion, the two boys fell upon each other, tooth  and nail, while Quilp, holding up the cage in one hand, and chopping  the ground with his knife in an ecstasy, urged them on by his taunts  and cries to fight more fiercely.
  They were a pretty equal match, and  rolled about together, exchanging blows which were by no means child's  play, until at length Kit, planting a well-directed hit in his  adversary's chest, disengaged himself, sprung nimbly up, and snatching  the cage from Quilp's hands made off with his prize.
    He did not stop once until he reached home, where his bleeding face  occasioned great consternation, and caused the elder child to howl  dreadfully.
    'Goodness gracious, Kit, what is the matter, what have you been doing?'  cried Mrs Nubbles.
    'Never you mind, mother,' answered her son, wiping his face on the  jack-towel behind the door.
  'I'm not hurt, don't you be afraid for me.
  I've been a fightin' for a bird and won him, that's all.
  Hold your  noise, little Jacob.
  I never see such a naughty boy in all my days!'    'You have been fighting for a bird!' exclaimed his mother.
    'Ah!  Fightin' for a bird!' replied Kit, 'and here he is--Miss Nelly's  bird, mother, that they was agoin' to wring the neck of!  I stopped  that though--ha ha ha!  They wouldn't wring his neck and me by, no, no.
  It wouldn't do, mother, it wouldn't do at all.
  Ha ha ha!'    Kit laughing so heartily, with his swoln and bruised face looking out  of the towel, made little Jacob laugh, and then his mother laughed, and  then the baby crowed and kicked with great glee, and then they all  laughed in concert: partly because of Kit's triumph, and partly because  they were very fond of each other.
  When this fit was over, Kit  exhibited the bird to both children, as a great and precious rarity--it  was only a poor linnet--and looking about the wall for an old nail,  made a scaffolding of a chair and table and twisted it out with great  exultation.
    'Let me see,' said the boy, 'I think I'll hang him in the winder,  because it's more light and cheerful, and he can see the sky there, if  he looks up very much.
  He's such a one to sing, I can tell you!'    So, the scaffolding was made again, and Kit, climbing up with the poker  for a hammer, knocked in the nail and hung up the cage, to the  immeasurable delight of the whole family.
  When it had been adjusted  and straightened a great many times, and he had walked backwards into  the fire-place in his admiration of it, the arrangement was pronounced  to be perfect.
    'And now, mother,' said the boy, 'before I rest any more, I'll go out  and see if I can find a horse to hold, and then I can buy some  birdseed, and a bit of something nice for you, into the bargain.
'              As it was very easy for Kit to persuade himself that the old house was  in his way, his way being anywhere, he tried to look upon his passing  it once more as a matter of imperative and disagreeable necessity,  quite apart from any desire of his own, to which he could not choose  but yield.
  It is not uncommon for people who are much better fed and  taught than Christopher Nubbles had ever been, to make duties of their  inclinations in matters of more doubtful propriety, and to take great  credit for the self-denial with which they gratify themselves.
    There was no need of any caution this time, and no fear of being  detained by having to play out a return match with Daniel Quilp's boy.
  The place was entirely deserted, and looked as dusty and dingy as if it  had been so for months.
  A rusty padlock was fastened on the door, ends  of discoloured blinds and curtains flapped drearily against the  half-opened upper windows, and the crooked holes cut in the closed  shutters below, were black with the darkness of the inside.
  Some of  the glass in the window he had so often watched, had been broken in the  rough hurry of the morning, and that room looked more deserted and dull  than any.
  A group of idle urchins had taken possession of the  door-steps; some were plying the knocker and listening with delighted  dread to the hollow sounds it spread through the dismantled house;  others were clustered about the keyhole, watching half in jest and half  in earnest for 'the ghost,' which an hour's gloom, added to the mystery  that hung about the late inhabitants, had already raised.
  Standing all  alone in the midst of the business and bustle of the street, the house  looked a picture of cold desolation; and Kit, who remembered the  cheerful fire that used to burn there on a winter's night and the no  less cheerful laugh that made the small room ring, turned quite  mournfully away.
    It must be especially observed in justice to poor Kit that he was by no  means of a sentimental turn, and perhaps had never heard that adjective  in all his life.
  He was only a soft-hearted grateful fellow, and had  nothing genteel or polite about him; consequently, instead of going  home again, in his grief, to kick the children and abuse his mother  (for, when your finely strung people are out of sorts, they must have  everybody else unhappy likewise), he turned his thoughts to the vulgar  expedient of making them more comfortable if he could.
    Bless us, what a number of gentlemen on horseback there were riding up  and down, and how few of them wanted their horses held!  A good city  speculator or a parliamentary commissioner could have told to a  fraction, from the crowds that were cantering about, what sum of money  was realised in London, in the course of a year, by holding horses  alone.
  And undoubtedly it would have been a very large one, if only a  twentieth part of the gentlemen without grooms had had occasion to  alight; but they had not; and it is often an ill-natured circumstance  like this, which spoils the most ingenious estimate in the world.
    Kit walked about, now with quick steps and now with slow; now lingering  as some rider slackened his horse's pace and looked about him; and now  darting at full speed up a bye-street as he caught a glimpse of some  distant horseman going lazily up the shady side of the road, and  promising to stop, at every door.
  But on they all went, one after  another, and there was not a penny stirring.
  'I wonder,' thought the  boy, 'if one of these gentlemen knew there was nothing in the cupboard  at home, whether he'd stop on purpose, and make believe that he wanted  to call somewhere, that I might earn a trifle?'    He was quite tired out with pacing the streets, to say nothing of  repeated disappointments, and was sitting down upon a step to rest,  when there approached towards him a little clattering jingling  four-wheeled chaise, drawn by a little obstinate-looking rough-coated  pony, and driven by a little fat placid-faced old gentleman.
  Beside  the little old gentleman sat a little old lady, plump and placid like  himself, and the pony was coming along at his own pace and doing  exactly as he pleased with the whole concern.
  If the old gentleman  remonstrated by shaking the reins, the pony replied by shaking his  head.
  It was plain that the utmost the pony would consent to do, was  to go in his own way up any street that the old gentleman particularly  wished to traverse, but that it was an understanding between them that  he must do this after his own fashion or not at all.
    As they passed where he sat, Kit looked so wistfully at the little  turn-out, that the old gentleman looked at him.
  Kit rising and putting  his hand to his hat, the old gentleman intimated to the pony that he  wished to stop, to which proposal the pony (who seldom objected to that  part of his duty) graciously acceded.
    'I beg your pardon, sir,' said Kit.
  'I'm sorry you stopped, sir.
  I  only meant did you want your horse minded.
'    'I'm going to get down in the next street,' returned the old gentleman.
  'If you like to come on after us, you may have the job.
'    Kit thanked him, and joyfully obeyed.
  The pony ran off at a sharp  angle to inspect a lamp-post on the opposite side of the way, and then  went off at a tangent to another lamp-post on the other side.
  Having  satisfied himself that they were of the same pattern and materials, he  came to a stop apparently absorbed in meditation.
    'Will you go on, sir,' said the old gentleman, gravely, 'or are we to  wait here for you till it's too late for our appointment?'    The pony remained immoveable.
    'Oh you naughty Whisker,' said the old lady.
  'Fie upon you!  I'm  ashamed of such conduct.
'    The pony appeared to be touched by this appeal to his feelings, for he  trotted on directly, though in a sulky manner, and stopped no more  until he came to a door whereon was a brass plate with the words  'Witherden--Notary.
'  Here the old gentleman got out and helped out the  old lady, and then took from under the seat a nosegay resembling in  shape and dimensions a full-sized warming-pan with the handle cut short  off.
  This, the old lady carried into the house with a staid and  stately air, and the old gentleman (who had a club-foot) followed close  upon her.
    They went, as it was easy to tell from the sound of their voices, into  the front parlour, which seemed to be a kind of office.
  The day being  very warm and the street a quiet one, the windows were wide open; and  it was easy to hear through the Venetian blinds all that passed inside.
    At first there was a great shaking of hands and shuffling of feet,  succeeded by the presentation of the nosegay; for a voice, supposed by  the listener to be that of Mr Witherden the Notary, was heard to  exclaim a great many times, 'oh, delicious!' 'oh, fragrant, indeed!'  and a nose, also supposed to be the property of that gentleman, was  heard to inhale the scent with a snuffle of exceeding pleasure.
    'I brought it in honour of the occasion, Sir,' said the old lady.
    'Ah! an occasion indeed, ma'am, an occasion which does honour to me,  ma'am, honour to me,' rejoined Mr Witherden, the notary.
  'I have had  many a gentleman articled to me, ma'am, many a one.
  Some of them are  now rolling in riches, unmindful of their old companion and friend,  ma'am, others are in the habit of calling upon me to this day and  saying, "Mr Witherden, some of the pleasantest hours I ever spent in my  life were spent in this office--were spent, Sir, upon this very stool";  but there was never one among the number, ma'am, attached as I have  been to many of them, of whom I augured such bright things as I do of  your only son.
'    'Oh dear!' said the old lady.
  'How happy you do make us when you tell  us that, to be sure!'    'I tell you, ma'am,' said Mr Witherden, 'what I think as an honest man,  which, as the poet observes, is the noblest work of God.
  I agree with  the poet in every particular, ma'am.
  The mountainous Alps on the one  hand, or a humming-bird on the other, is nothing, in point of  workmanship, to an honest man--or woman--or woman.
'    'Anything that Mr Witherden can say of me,' observed a small quiet  voice, 'I can say, with interest, of him, I am sure.
'    'It's a happy circumstance, a truly happy circumstance,' said the  Notary, 'to happen too upon his eight-and-twentieth birthday, and I  hope I know how to appreciate it.
  I trust, Mr Garland, my dear Sir,  that we may mutually congratulate each other upon this auspicious  occasion.
'    To this the old gentleman replied that he felt assured they might.
  There appeared to be another shaking of hands in consequence, and when  it was over, the old gentleman said that, though he said it who should  not, he believed no son had ever been a greater comfort to his parents  than Abel Garland had been to his.
    'Marrying as his mother and I did, late in life, sir, after waiting for  a great many years, until we were well enough off--coming together when  we were no longer young, and then being blessed with one child who has  always been dutiful and affectionate--why, it's a source of great  happiness to us both, sir.
'    'Of course it is, I have no doubt of it,' returned the Notary in a  sympathising voice.
  'It's the contemplation of this sort of thing,  that makes me deplore my fate in being a bachelor.
  There was a young  lady once, sir, the daughter of an outfitting warehouse of the first  respectability--but that's a weakness.
  Chuckster, bring in Mr Abel's  articles.
'    'You see, Mr Witherden,' said the old lady, 'that Abel has not been  brought up like the run of young men.
  He has always had a pleasure in  our society, and always been with us.
  Abel has never been absent from  us, for a day; has he, my dear?'    'Never, my dear,' returned the old gentleman, 'except when he went to  Margate one Saturday with Mr Tomkinley that had been a teacher at that  school he went to, and came back upon the Monday; but he was very ill  after that, you remember, my dear; it was quite a dissipation.
'    'He was not used to it, you know,' said the old lady, 'and he couldn't  bear it, that's the truth.
  Besides he had no comfort in being there  without us, and had nobody to talk to or enjoy himself with.
'    'That was it, you know,' interposed the same small quiet voice that had  spoken once before.
  'I was quite abroad, mother, quite desolate, and  to think that the sea was between us--oh, I never shall forget what I  felt when I first thought that the sea was between us!'    'Very natural under the circumstances,' observed the Notary.
  'Mr  Abel's feelings did credit to his nature, and credit to your nature,  ma'am, and his father's nature, and human nature.
  I trace the same  current now, flowing through all his quiet and unobtrusive  proceedings.
--I am about to sign my name, you observe, at the foot of  the articles which Mr Chuckster will witness; and placing my finger  upon this blue wafer with the vandyked corners, I am constrained to  remark in a distinct tone of voice--don't be alarmed, ma'am, it is  merely a form of law--that I deliver this, as my act and deed.
  Mr Abel  will place his name against the other wafer, repeating the same  cabalistic words, and the business is over.
  Ha ha ha!  You see how  easily these things are done!'    There was a short silence, apparently, while Mr Abel went through the  prescribed form, and then the shaking of hands and shuffling of feet  were renewed, and shortly afterwards there was a clinking of  wine-glasses and a great talkativeness on the part of everybody.
  In  about a quarter of an hour Mr Chuckster (with a pen behind his ear and  his face inflamed with wine) appeared at the door, and condescending to  address Kit by the jocose appellation of 'Young Snob,' informed him  that the visitors were coming out.
    Out they came forthwith; Mr Witherden, who was short, chubby,  fresh-coloured, brisk, and pompous, leading the old lady with extreme  politeness, and the father and son following them, arm in arm.
  Mr  Abel, who had a quaint old-fashioned air about him, looked nearly of  the same age as his father, and bore a wonderful resemblance to him in  face and figure, though wanting something of his full, round,  cheerfulness, and substituting in its place a timid reserve.
  In all  other respects, in the neatness of the dress, and even in the  club-foot, he and the old gentleman were precisely alike.
    Having seen the old lady safely in her seat, and assisted in the  arrangement of her cloak and a small basket which formed an  indispensable portion of her equipage, Mr Abel got into a little box  behind which had evidently been made for his express accommodation, and  smiled at everybody present by turns, beginning with his mother and  ending with the pony.
  There was then a great to-do to make the pony  hold up his head that the bearing-rein might be fastened; at last even  this was effected; and the old gentleman, taking his seat and the  reins, put his hand in his pocket to find a sixpence for Kit.
    He had no sixpence, neither had the old lady, nor Mr Abel, nor the  Notary, nor Mr Chuckster.
  The old gentleman thought a shilling too  much, but there was no shop in the street to get change at, so he gave  it to the boy.
    'There,' he said jokingly, 'I'm coming here again next Monday at the  same time, and mind you're here, my lad, to work it out.
'    'Thank you, Sir,' said Kit.
  'I'll be sure to be here.
'    He was quite serious, but they all laughed heartily at his saying so,  especially Mr Chuckster, who roared outright and appeared to relish the  joke amazingly.
  As the pony, with a presentiment that he was going  home, or a determination that he would not go anywhere else (which was  the same thing) trotted away pretty nimbly, Kit had no time to justify  himself, and went his way also.
  Having expended his treasure in such  purchases as he knew would be most acceptable at home, not forgetting  some seed for the wonderful bird, he hastened back as fast as he could,  so elated with his success and great good fortune, that he more than  half expected Nell and the old man would have arrived before him.
              Often, while they were yet pacing the silent streets of the town on the  morning of their departure, the child trembled with a mingled sensation  of hope and fear as in some far-off figure imperfectly seen in the  clear distance, her fancy traced a likeness to honest Kit.
  But  although she would gladly have given him her hand and thanked him for  what he had said at their last meeting, it was always a relief to find,  when they came nearer to each other, that the person who approached was  not he, but a stranger; for even if she had not dreaded the effect  which the sight of him might have wrought upon her fellow-traveller,  she felt that to bid farewell to anybody now, and most of all to him  who had been so faithful and so true, was more than she could bear.
  It  was enough to leave dumb things behind, and objects that were  insensible both to her love and sorrow.
  To have parted from her only  other friend upon the threshold of that wild journey, would have wrung  her heart indeed.
    Why is it that we can better bear to part in spirit than in body, and  while we have the fortitude to act farewell have not the nerve to say  it?  On the eve of long voyages or an absence of many years, friends  who are tenderly attached will separate with the usual look, the usual  pressure of the hand, planning one final interview for the morrow,  while each well knows that it is but a poor feint to save the pain of  uttering that one word, and that the meeting will never be.
  Should  possibilities be worse to bear than certainties?  We do not shun our  dying friends; the not having distinctly taken leave of one among them,  whom we left in all kindness and affection, will often embitter the  whole remainder of a life.
    The town was glad with morning light; places that had shown ugly and  distrustful all night long, now wore a smile; and sparkling sunbeams  dancing on chamber windows, and twinkling through blind and curtain  before sleepers' eyes, shed light even into dreams, and chased away the  shadows of the night.
  Birds in hot rooms, covered up close and dark,  felt it was morning, and chafed and grew restless in their little  cells; bright-eyed mice crept back to their tiny homes and nestled  timidly together; the sleek house-cat, forgetful of her prey, sat  winking at the rays of sun starting through keyhole and cranny in the  door, and longed for her stealthy run and warm sleek bask outside.
  The  nobler beasts confined in dens, stood motionless behind their bars and  gazed on fluttering boughs, and sunshine peeping through some little  window, with eyes in which old forests gleamed--then trod impatiently  the track their prisoned feet had worn--and stopped and gazed again.
  Men in their dungeons stretched their cramp cold limbs and cursed the  stone that no bright sky could warm.
  The flowers that sleep by night,  opened their gentle eyes and turned them to the day.
  The light,  creation's mind, was everywhere, and all things owned its power.
    The two pilgrims, often pressing each other's hands, or exchanging a  smile or cheerful look, pursued their way in silence.
  Bright and happy  as it was, there was something solemn in the long, deserted streets,  from which, like bodies without souls, all habitual character and  expression had departed, leaving but one dead uniform repose, that made  them all alike.
  All was so still at that early hour, that the few pale  people whom they met seemed as much unsuited to the scene, as the  sickly lamp which had been here and there left burning, was powerless  and faint in the full glory of the sun.
    Before they had penetrated very far into the labyrinth of men's abodes  which yet lay between them and the outskirts, this aspect began to melt  away, and noise and bustle to usurp its place.
  Some straggling carts  and coaches rumbling by, first broke the charm, then others came, then  others yet more active, then a crowd.
  The wonder was, at first, to see  a tradesman's window open, but it was a rare thing soon to see one  closed; then, smoke rose slowly from the chimneys, and sashes were  thrown up to let in air, and doors were opened, and servant girls,  looking lazily in all directions but their brooms, scattered brown  clouds of dust into the eyes of shrinking passengers, or listened  disconsolately to milkmen who spoke of country fairs, and told of  waggons in the mews, with awnings and all things complete, and gallant  swains to boot, which another hour would see upon their journey.
    This quarter passed, they came upon the haunts of commerce and great  traffic, where many people were resorting, and business was already  rife.
  The old man looked about him with a startled and bewildered  gaze, for these were places that he hoped to shun.
  He pressed his  finger on his lip, and drew the child along by narrow courts and  winding ways, nor did he seem at ease until they had left it far  behind, often casting a backward look towards it, murmuring that ruin  and self-murder were crouching in every street, and would follow if  they scented them; and that they could not fly too fast.
    Again this quarter passed, they came upon a straggling neighbourhood,  where the mean houses parcelled off in rooms, and windows patched with  rags and paper, told of the populous poverty that sheltered there.
  The  shops sold goods that only poverty could buy, and sellers and buyers  were pinched and griped alike.
  Here were poor streets where faded  gentility essayed with scanty space and shipwrecked means to make its  last feeble stand, but tax-gatherer and creditor came there as  elsewhere, and the poverty that yet faintly struggled was hardly less  squalid and manifest than that which had long ago submitted and given  up the game.
    This was a wide, wide track--for the humble followers of the camp of  wealth pitch their tents round about it for many a mile--but its  character was still the same.
  Damp rotten houses, many to let, many  yet building, many half-built and mouldering away--lodgings, where it  would be hard to tell which needed pity most, those who let or those  who came to take--children, scantily fed and clothed, spread over every  street, and sprawling in the dust--scolding mothers, stamping their  slipshod feet with noisy threats upon the pavement--shabby fathers,  hurrying with dispirited looks to the occupation which brought them  'daily bread' and little more--mangling-women, washer-women, cobblers,  tailors, chandlers, driving their trades in parlours and kitchens and  back room and garrets, and sometimes all of them under the same  roof--brick-fields skirting gardens paled with staves of old casks, or  timber pillaged from houses burnt down, and blackened and blistered by  the flames--mounds of dock-weed, nettles, coarse grass and  oyster-shells, heaped in rank confusion--small dissenting chapels to  teach, with no lack of illustration, the miseries of Earth, and plenty  of new churches, erected with a little superfluous wealth, to show the  way to Heaven.
    At length these streets becoming more straggling yet, dwindled and  dwindled away, until there were only small garden patches bordering the  road, with many a summer house innocent of paint and built of old  timber or some fragments of a boat, green as the tough cabbage-stalks  that grew about it, and grottoed at the seams with toad-stools and  tight-sticking snails.
  To these succeeded pert cottages, two and two  with plots of ground in front, laid out in angular beds with stiff box  borders and narrow paths between, where footstep never strayed to make  the gravel rough.
  Then came the public-house, freshly painted in green  and white, with tea-gardens and a bowling green, spurning its old  neighbour with the horse-trough where the waggons stopped; then,  fields; and then, some houses, one by one, of goodly size with lawns,  some even with a lodge where dwelt a porter and his wife.
  Then came a  turnpike; then fields again with trees and hay-stacks; then, a hill,  and on the top of that, the traveller might stop, and--looking back at  old Saint Paul's looming through the smoke, its cross peeping above the  cloud (if the day were clear), and glittering in the sun; and casting  his eyes upon the Babel out of which it grew until he traced it down to  the furthest outposts of the invading army of bricks and mortar whose  station lay for the present nearly at his feet--might feel at last that  he was clear of London.
    Near such a spot as this, and in a pleasant field, the old man and his  little guide (if guide she were, who knew not whither they were bound)  sat down to rest.
  She had had the precaution to furnish her basket  with some slices of bread and meat, and here they made their frugal  breakfast.
    The freshness of the day, the singing of the birds, the beauty of the  waving grass, the deep green leaves, the wild flowers, and the thousand  exquisite scents and sounds that floated in the air--deep joys to most  of us, but most of all to those whose life is in a crowd or who live  solitarily in great cities as in the bucket of a human well--sunk into  their breasts and made them very glad.
  The child had repeated her  artless prayers once that morning, more earnestly perhaps than she had  ever done in all her life, but as she felt all this, they rose to her  lips again.
  The old man took off his hat--he had no memory for the  words--but he said amen, and that they were very good.
    There had been an old copy of the Pilgrim's Progress, with strange  plates, upon a shelf at home, over which she had often pored whole  evenings, wondering whether it was true in every word, and where those  distant countries with the curious names might be.
  As she looked back  upon the place they had left, one part of it came strongly on her mind.
    'Dear grandfather,' she said, 'only that this place is prettier and a  great deal better than the real one, if that in the book is like it, I  feel as if we were both Christian, and laid down on this grass all the  cares and troubles we brought with us; never to take them up again.
'    'No--never to return--never to return'--replied the old man, waving his  hand towards the city.
  'Thou and I are free of it now, Nell.
  They  shall never lure us back.
'    'Are you tired?' said the child, 'are you sure you don't feel ill from  this long walk?'    'I shall never feel ill again, now that we are once away,' was his  reply.
  'Let us be stirring, Nell.
  We must be further away--a long,  long way further.
  We are too near to stop, and be at rest.
  Come!'    There was a pool of clear water in the field, in which the child laved  her hands and face, and cooled her feet before setting forth to walk  again.
  She would have the old man refresh himself in this way too, and  making him sit down upon the grass, cast the water on him with her  hands, and dried it with her simple dress.
    'I can do nothing for myself, my darling,' said the grandfather; 'I  don't know how it is, I could once, but the time's gone.
  Don't leave  me, Nell; say that thou'lt not leave me.
  I loved thee all the while,  indeed I did.
  If I lose thee too, my dear, I must die!'    He laid his head upon her shoulder and moaned piteously.
  The time had  been, and a very few days before, when the child could not have  restrained her tears and must have wept with him.
  But now she soothed  him with gentle and tender words, smiled at his thinking they could  ever part, and rallied him cheerfully upon the jest.
  He was soon  calmed and fell asleep, singing to himself in a low voice, like a  little child.
    He awoke refreshed, and they continued their journey.
  The road was  pleasant, lying between beautiful pastures and fields of corn, about  which, poised high in the clear blue sky, the lark trilled out her  happy song.
  The air came laden with the fragrance it caught upon its  way, and the bees, upborne upon its scented breath, hummed forth their  drowsy satisfaction as they floated by.
    They were now in the open country; the houses were very few and  scattered at long intervals, often miles apart.
  Occasionally they came  upon a cluster of poor cottages, some with a chair or low board put  across the open door to keep the scrambling children from the road,  others shut up close while all the family were working in the fields.
  These were often the commencement of a little village: and after an  interval came a wheelwright's shed or perhaps a blacksmith's forge;  then a thriving farm with sleepy cows lying about the yard, and horses  peering over the low wall and scampering away when harnessed horses  passed upon the road, as though in triumph at their freedom.
  There  were dull pigs too, turning up the ground in search of dainty food, and  grunting their monotonous grumblings as they prowled about, or crossed  each other in their quest; plump pigeons skimming round the roof or  strutting on the eaves; and ducks and geese, far more graceful in their  own conceit, waddling awkwardly about the edges of the pond or sailing  glibly on its surface.
  The farm-yard passed, then came the little inn;  the humbler beer-shop; and the village tradesman's; then the lawyer's  and the parson's, at whose dread names the beer-shop trembled; the  church then peeped out modestly from a clump of trees; then there were  a few more cottages; then the cage, and pound, and not unfrequently, on  a bank by the way-side, a deep old dusty well.
  Then came the  trim-hedged fields on either hand, and the open road again.
    They walked all day, and slept that night at a small cottage where beds  were let to travellers.
  Next morning they were afoot again, and though  jaded at first, and very tired, recovered before long and proceeded  briskly forward.
    They often stopped to rest, but only for a short space at a time, and  still kept on, having had but slight refreshment since the morning.
  It  was nearly five o'clock in the afternoon, when drawing near another  cluster of labourers' huts, the child looked wistfully in each,  doubtful at which to ask for permission to rest awhile, and buy a  draught of milk.
    It was not easy to determine, for she was timid and fearful of being  repulsed.
  Here was a crying child, and there a noisy wife.
  In this,  the people seemed too poor; in that, too many.
  At length she stopped  at one where the family were seated round the table--chiefly because  there was an old man sitting in a cushioned chair beside the hearth,  and she thought he was a grandfather and would feel for hers.
    There were besides, the cottager and his wife, and three young sturdy  children, brown as berries.
  The request was no sooner preferred, than  granted.
  The eldest boy ran out to fetch some milk, the second dragged  two stools towards the door, and the youngest crept to his mother's  gown, and looked at the strangers from beneath his sunburnt hand.
    'God save you, master,' said the old cottager in a thin piping voice;  'are you travelling far?'    'Yes, Sir, a long way'--replied the child; for her grandfather appealed  to her.
    'From London?' inquired the old man.
    The child said yes.
    Ah!  He had been in London many a time--used to go there often once,  with waggons.
  It was nigh two-and-thirty year since he had been there  last, and he did hear say there were great changes.
  Like enough!  He  had changed, himself, since then.
  Two-and-thirty year was a long time  and eighty-four a great age, though there was some he had known that  had lived to very hard upon a hundred--and not so hearty as he,  neither--no, nothing like it.
    'Sit thee down, master, in the elbow chair,' said the old man, knocking  his stick upon the brick floor, and trying to do so sharply.
  'Take a  pinch out o' that box; I don't take much myself, for it comes dear, but  I find it wakes me up sometimes, and ye're but a boy to me.
  I should  have a son pretty nigh as old as you if he'd lived, but they listed him  for a so'ger--he come back home though, for all he had but one poor  leg.
  He always said he'd be buried near the sun-dial he used to climb  upon when he was a baby, did my poor boy, and his words come true--you  can see the place with your own eyes; we've kept the turf up, ever  since.
'    He shook his head, and looking at his daughter with watery eyes, said  she needn't be afraid that he was going to talk about that, any more.
  He didn't wish to trouble nobody, and if he had troubled anybody by  what he said, he asked pardon, that was all.
    The milk arrived, and the child producing her little basket, and  selecting its best fragments for her grandfather, they made a hearty  meal.
  The furniture of the room was very homely of course--a few rough  chairs and a table, a corner cupboard with their little stock of  crockery and delf, a gaudy tea-tray, representing a lady in bright red,  walking out with a very blue parasol, a few common, coloured scripture  subjects in frames upon the wall and chimney, an old dwarf  clothes-press and an eight-day clock, with a few bright saucepans and a  kettle, comprised the whole.
  But everything was clean and neat, and as  the child glanced round, she felt a tranquil air of comfort and content  to which she had long been unaccustomed.
    'How far is it to any town or village?' she asked of the husband.
    'A matter of good five mile, my dear,' was the reply, 'but you're not  going on to-night?'    'Yes, yes, Nell,' said the old man hastily, urging her too by signs.
  'Further on, further on, darling, further away if we walk till  midnight.
'    'There's a good barn hard by, master,' said the man, 'or there's  travellers' lodging, I know, at the Plow an' Harrer.
  Excuse me, but  you do seem a little tired, and unless you're very anxious to get on--'    'Yes, yes, we are,' returned the old man fretfully.
  'Further away,  dear Nell, pray further away.
'    'We must go on, indeed,' said the child, yielding to his restless wish.
  'We thank you very much, but we cannot stop so soon.
  I'm quite ready,  grandfather.
'    But the woman had observed, from the young wanderer's gait, that one of  her little feet was blistered and sore, and being a woman and a mother  too, she would not suffer her to go until she had washed the place and  applied some simple remedy, which she did so carefully and with such a  gentle hand--rough-grained and hard though it was, with work--that the  child's heart was too full to admit of her saying more than a fervent  'God bless you!' nor could she look back nor trust herself to speak,  until they had left the cottage some distance behind.
  When she turned  her head, she saw that the whole family, even the old grandfather, were  standing in the road watching them as they went, and so, with many  waves of the hand, and cheering nods, and on one side at least not  without tears, they parted company.
    They trudged forward, more slowly and painfully than they had done yet,  for another mile or thereabouts, when they heard the sound of wheels  behind them, and looking round observed an empty cart approaching  pretty briskly.
  The driver on coming up to them stopped his horse and  looked earnestly at Nell.
    'Didn't you stop to rest at a cottage yonder?' he said.
    'Yes, sir,' replied the child.
    'Ah!  They asked me to look out for you,' said the man.
  'I'm going  your way.
  Give me your hand--jump up, master.
'    This was a great relief, for they were very much fatigued and could  scarcely crawl along.
  To them the jolting cart was a luxurious  carriage, and the ride the most delicious in the world.
  Nell had  scarcely settled herself on a little heap of straw in one corner, when  she fell asleep, for the first time that day.
    She was awakened by the stopping of the cart, which was about to turn  up a bye-lane.
  The driver kindly got down to help her out, and  pointing to some trees at a very short distance before them, said that  the town lay there, and that they had better take the path which they  would see leading through the churchyard.
  Accordingly, towards this  spot, they directed their weary steps.
              The sun was setting when they reached the wicket-gate at which the path  began, and, as the rain falls upon the just and unjust alike, it shed  its warm tint even upon the resting-places of the dead, and bade them  be of good hope for its rising on the morrow.
  The church was old and  grey, with ivy clinging to the walls, and round the porch.
  Shunning  the tombs, it crept about the mounds, beneath which slept poor humble  men: twining for them the first wreaths they had ever won, but wreaths  less liable to wither and far more lasting in their kind, than some  which were graven deep in stone and marble, and told in pompous terms  of virtues meekly hidden for many a year, and only revealed at last to  executors and mourning legatees.
    The clergyman's horse, stumbling with a dull blunt sound among the  graves, was cropping the grass; at once deriving orthodox consolation  from the dead parishioners, and enforcing last Sunday's text that this  was what all flesh came to; a lean ass who had sought to expound it  also, without being qualified and ordained, was pricking his ears in an  empty pound hard by, and looking with hungry eyes upon his priestly  neighbour.
    The old man and the child quitted the gravel path, and strayed among  the tombs; for there the ground was soft, and easy to their tired feet.
  As they passed behind the church, they heard voices near at hand, and  presently came on those who had spoken.
    They were two men who were seated in easy attitudes upon the grass, and  so busily engaged as to be at first unconscious of intruders.
  It was  not difficult to divine that they were of a class of itinerant  showmen--exhibitors of the freaks of Punch--for, perched cross-legged  upon a tombstone behind them, was a figure of that hero himself, his  nose and chin as hooked and his face as beaming as usual.
  Perhaps his  imperturbable character was never more strikingly developed, for he  preserved his usual equable smile notwithstanding that his body was  dangling in a most uncomfortable position, all loose and limp and  shapeless, while his long peaked cap, unequally balanced against his  exceedingly slight legs, threatened every instant to bring him toppling  down.
    In part scattered upon the ground at the feet of the two men, and in  part jumbled together in a long flat box, were the other persons of the  Drama.
  The hero's wife and one child, the hobby-horse, the doctor, the  foreign gentleman who not being familiar with the language is unable in  the representation to express his ideas otherwise than by the utterance  of the word 'Shallabalah' three distinct times, the radical neighbour  who will by no means admit that a tin bell is an organ, the  executioner, and the devil, were all here.
  Their owners had evidently  come to that spot to make some needful repairs in the stage  arrangements, for one of them was engaged in binding together a small  gallows with thread, while the other was intent upon fixing a new black  wig, with the aid of a small hammer and some tacks, upon the head of  the radical neighbour, who had been beaten bald.
    They raised their eyes when the old man and his young companion were  close upon them, and pausing in their work, returned their looks of  curiosity.
  One of them, the actual exhibitor no doubt, was a little  merry-faced man with a twinkling eye and a red nose, who seemed to have  unconsciously imbibed something of his hero's character.
  The  other--that was he who took the money--had rather a careful and  cautious look, which was perhaps inseparable from his occupation also.
    The merry man was the first to greet the strangers with a nod; and  following the old man's eyes, he observed that perhaps that was the  first time he had ever seen a Punch off the stage.
  (Punch, it may be  remarked, seemed to be pointing with the tip of his cap to a most  flourishing epitaph, and to be chuckling over it with all his heart.
)    'Why do you come here to do this?' said the old man, sitting down  beside them, and looking at the figures with extreme delight.
    'Why you see,' rejoined the little man, 'we're putting up for to-night  at the public-house yonder, and it wouldn't do to let 'em see the  present company undergoing repair.
'    'No!' cried the old man, making signs to Nell to listen, 'why not, eh?  why not?'    'Because it would destroy all the delusion, and take away all the  interest, wouldn't it?' replied the little man.
  'Would you care a  ha'penny for the Lord Chancellor if you know'd him in private and  without his wig?--certainly not.
'    'Good!' said the old man, venturing to touch one of the puppets, and  drawing away his hand with a shrill laugh.
  'Are you going to show 'em  to-night?  are you?'    'That is the intention, governor,' replied the other, 'and unless I'm  much mistaken, Tommy Codlin is a calculating at this minute what we've  lost through your coming upon us.
  Cheer up, Tommy, it can't be much.
'    The little man accompanied these latter words with a wink, expressive  of the estimate he had formed of the travellers' finances.
    To this Mr Codlin, who had a surly, grumbling manner, replied, as he  twitched Punch off the tombstone and flung him into the box, 'I don't  care if we haven't lost a farden, but you're too free.
  If you stood in  front of the curtain and see the public's faces as I do, you'd know  human natur' better.
'    'Ah! it's been the spoiling of you, Tommy, your taking to that branch,'  rejoined his companion.
  'When you played the ghost in the reg'lar  drama in the fairs, you believed in everything--except ghosts.
  But now  you're a universal mistruster.
  I never see a man so changed.
'    'Never mind,' said Mr Codlin, with the air of a discontented  philosopher.
  'I know better now, and p'raps I'm sorry for it.
'    Turning over the figures in the box like one who knew and despised  them, Mr Codlin drew one forth and held it up for the inspection of his  friend:    'Look here; here's all this judy's clothes falling to pieces again.
  You haven't got a needle and thread I suppose?'    The little man shook his head, and scratched it ruefully as he  contemplated this severe indisposition of a principal performer.
  Seeing that they were at a loss, the child said timidly:    'I have a needle, Sir, in my basket, and thread too.
  Will you let me  try to mend it for you?  I think I could do it neater than you could.
'    Even Mr Codlin had nothing to urge against a proposal so seasonable.
  Nelly, kneeling down beside the box, was soon busily engaged in her  task, and accomplishing it to a miracle.
    While she was thus engaged, the merry little man looked at her with an  interest which did not appear to be diminished when he glanced at her  helpless companion.
  When she had finished her work he thanked her, and  inquired whither they were travelling.
    'N--no further to-night, I think,' said the child, looking towards her  grandfather.
    'If you're wanting a place to stop at,' the man remarked, 'I should  advise you to take up at the same house with us.
  That's it.
  The long,  low, white house there.
  It's very cheap.
'    The old man, notwithstanding his fatigue, would have remained in the  churchyard all night if his new acquaintances had remained there too.
  As he yielded to this suggestion a ready and rapturous assent, they all  rose and walked away together; he keeping close to the box of puppets  in which he was quite absorbed, the merry little man carrying it slung  over his arm by a strap attached to it for the purpose, Nelly having  hold of her grandfather's hand, and Mr Codlin sauntering slowly behind,  casting up at the church tower and neighbouring trees such looks as he  was accustomed in town-practice to direct to drawing-room and nursery  windows, when seeking for a profitable spot on which to plant the show.
    The public-house was kept by a fat old landlord and landlady who made  no objection to receiving their new guests, but praised Nelly's beauty  and were at once prepossessed in her behalf.
  There was no other  company in the kitchen but the two showmen, and the child felt very  thankful that they had fallen upon such good quarters.
  The landlady  was very much astonished to learn that they had come all the way from  London, and appeared to have no little curiosity touching their farther  destination.
  The child parried her inquiries as well as she could, and  with no great trouble, for finding that they appeared to give her pain,  the old lady desisted.
    'These two gentlemen have ordered supper in an hour's time,' she said,  taking her into the bar; 'and your best plan will be to sup with them.
  Meanwhile you shall have a little taste of something that'll do you  good, for I'm sure you must want it after all you've gone through  to-day.
  Now, don't look after the old gentleman, because when you've  drank that, he shall have some too.
'    As nothing could induce the child to leave him alone, however, or to  touch anything in which he was not the first and greatest sharer, the  old lady was obliged to help him first.
  When they had been thus  refreshed, the whole house hurried away into an empty stable where the  show stood, and where, by the light of a few flaring candles stuck  round a hoop which hung by a line from the ceiling, it was to be  forthwith exhibited.
    And now Mr Thomas Codlin, the misanthrope, after blowing away at the  Pan's pipes until he was intensely wretched, took his station on one  side of the checked drapery which concealed the mover of the figures,  and putting his hands in his pockets prepared to reply to all questions  and remarks of Punch, and to make a dismal feint of being his most  intimate private friend, of believing in him to the fullest and most  unlimited extent, of knowing that he enjoyed day and night a merry and  glorious existence in that temple, and that he was at all times and  under every circumstance the same intelligent and joyful person that  the spectators then beheld him.
  All this Mr Codlin did with the air of  a man who had made up his mind for the worst and was quite resigned;  his eye slowly wandering about during the briskest repartee to observe  the effect upon the audience, and particularly the impression made upon  the landlord and landlady, which might be productive of very important  results in connexion with the supper.
    Upon this head, however, he had no cause for any anxiety, for the whole  performance was applauded to the echo, and voluntary contributions were  showered in with a liberality which testified yet more strongly to the  general delight.
  Among the laughter none was more loud and frequent  than the old man's.
  Nell's was unheard, for she, poor child, with her  head drooping on his shoulder, had fallen asleep, and slept too soundly  to be roused by any of his efforts to awaken her to a participation in  his glee.
    The supper was very good, but she was too tired to eat, and yet would  not leave the old man until she had kissed him in his bed.
  He, happily  insensible to every care and anxiety, sat listening with a vacant smile  and admiring face to all that his new friend said; and it was not until  they retired yawning to their room, that he followed the child up  stairs.
    It was but a loft partitioned into two compartments, where they were to  rest, but they were well pleased with their lodging and had hoped for  none so good.
  The old man was uneasy when he had lain down, and begged  that Nell would come and sit at his bedside as she had done for so many  nights.
  She hastened to him, and sat there till he slept.
    There was a little window, hardly more than a chink in the wall, in her  room, and when she left him, she opened it, quite wondering at the  silence.
  The sight of the old church, and the graves about it in the  moonlight, and the dark trees whispering among themselves, made her  more thoughtful than before.
  She closed the window again, and sitting  down upon the bed, thought of the life that was before them.
    She had a little money, but it was very little, and when that was gone,  they must begin to beg.
  There was one piece of gold among it, and an  emergency might come when its worth to them would be increased a  hundred fold.
  It would be best to hide this coin, and never produce it  unless their case was absolutely desperate, and no other resource was  left them.
    Her resolution taken, she sewed the piece of gold into her dress, and  going to bed with a lighter heart sunk into a deep slumber.
              Another bright day shining in through the small casement, and claiming  fellowship with the kindred eyes of the child, awoke her.
  At sight of  the strange room and its unaccustomed objects she started up in alarm,  wondering how she had been moved from the familiar chamber in which she  seemed to have fallen asleep last night, and whither she had been  conveyed.
  But, another glance around called to her mind all that had  lately passed, and she sprung from her bed, hoping and trustful.
    It was yet early, and the old man being still asleep, she walked out  into the churchyard, brushing the dew from the long grass with her  feet, and often turning aside into places where it grew longer than in  others, that she might not tread upon the graves.
  She felt a curious  kind of pleasure in lingering among these houses of the dead, and read  the inscriptions on the tombs of the good people (a great number of  good people were buried there), passing on from one to another with  increasing interest.
    It was a very quiet place, as such a place should be, save for the  cawing of the rooks who had built their nests among the branches of  some tall old trees, and were calling to one another, high up in the  air.
  First, one sleek bird, hovering near his ragged house as it swung  and dangled in the wind, uttered his hoarse cry, quite by chance as it  would seem, and in a sober tone as though he were but talking to  himself.
  Another answered, and he called again, but louder than  before; then another spoke and then another; and each time the first,  aggravated by contradiction, insisted on his case more strongly.
  Other  voices, silent till now, struck in from boughs lower down and higher up  and midway, and to the right and left, and from the tree-tops; and  others, arriving hastily from the grey church turrets and old belfry  window, joined the clamour which rose and fell, and swelled and dropped  again, and still went on; and all this noisy contention amidst a  skimming to and fro, and lighting on fresh branches, and frequent  change of place, which satirised the old restlessness of those who lay  so still beneath the moss and turf below, and the strife in which they  had worn away their lives.
    Frequently raising her eyes to the trees whence these sounds came down,  and feeling as though they made the place more quiet than perfect  silence would have done, the child loitered from grave to grave, now  stopping to replace with careful hands the bramble which had started  from some green mound it helped to keep in shape, and now peeping  through one of the low latticed windows into the church, with its  worm-eaten books upon the desks, and baize of whitened-green mouldering  from the pew sides and leaving the naked wood to view.
  There were the  seats where the poor old people sat, worn spare, and yellow like  themselves; the rugged font where children had their names, the homely  altar where they knelt in after life, the plain black tressels that  bore their weight on their last visit to the cool old shady church.
  Everything told of long use and quiet slow decay; the very bell-rope in  the porch was frayed into a fringe, and hoary with old age.
    She was looking at a humble stone which told of a young man who had  died at twenty-three years old, fifty-five years ago, when she heard a  faltering step approaching, and looking round saw a feeble woman bent  with the weight of years, who tottered to the foot of that same grave  and asked her to read the writing on the stone.
  The old woman thanked  her when she had done, saying that she had had the words by heart for  many a long, long year, but could not see them now.
    'Were you his mother?' said the child.
    'I was his wife, my dear.
'    She the wife of a young man of three-and-twenty!  Ah, true!  It was  fifty-five years ago.
    'You wonder to hear me say that,' remarked the old woman, shaking her  head.
  'You're not the first.
  Older folk than you have wondered at the  same thing before now.
  Yes, I was his wife.
  Death doesn't change us  more than life, my dear.
'    'Do you come here often?' asked the child.
    'I sit here very often in the summer time,' she answered, 'I used to  come here once to cry and mourn, but that was a weary while ago, bless  God!'    'I pluck the daisies as they grow, and take them home,' said the old  woman after a short silence.
  'I like no flowers so well as these, and  haven't for five-and-fifty years.
  It's a long time, and I'm getting  very old.
'    Then growing garrulous upon a theme which was new to one listener  though it were but a child, she told her how she had wept and moaned  and prayed to die herself, when this happened; and how when she first  came to that place, a young creature strong in love and grief, she had  hoped that her heart was breaking as it seemed to be.
  But that time  passed by, and although she continued to be sad when she came there,  still she could bear to come, and so went on until it was pain no  longer, but a solemn pleasure, and a duty she had learned to like.
  And  now that five-and-fifty years were gone, she spoke of the dead man as  if he had been her son or grandson, with a kind of pity for his youth,  growing out of her own old age, and an exalting of his strength and  manly beauty as compared with her own weakness and decay; and yet she  spoke about him as her husband too, and thinking of herself in  connexion with him, as she used to be and not as she was now, talked of  their meeting in another world, as if he were dead but yesterday, and  she, separated from her former self, were thinking of the happiness of  that comely girl who seemed to have died with him.
    The child left her gathering the flowers that grew upon the grave, and  thoughtfully retraced her steps.
    The old man was by this time up and dressed.
  Mr Codlin, still doomed  to contemplate the harsh realities of existence, was packing among his  linen the candle-ends which had been saved from the previous night's  performance; while his companion received the compliments of all the  loungers in the stable-yard, who, unable to separate him from the  master-mind of Punch, set him down as next in importance to that merry  outlaw, and loved him scarcely less.
  When he had sufficiently  acknowledged his popularity he came in to breakfast, at which meal they  all sat down together.
    'And where are you going to-day?' said the little man, addressing  himself to Nell.
    'Indeed I hardly know--we have not determined yet,' replied the child.
    'We're going on to the races,' said the little man.
  'If that's your  way and you like to have us for company, let us travel together.
  If  you prefer going alone, only say the word and you'll find that we  shan't trouble you.
'    'We'll go with you,' said the old man.
  'Nell--with them, with them.
'    The child considered for a moment, and reflecting that she must shortly  beg, and could scarcely hope to do so at a better place than where  crowds of rich ladies and gentlemen were assembled together for  purposes of enjoyment and festivity, determined to accompany these men  so far.
  She therefore thanked the little man for his offer, and said,  glancing timidly towards his friend, that if there was no objection to  their accompanying them as far as the race town--    'Objection!' said the little man.
  'Now be gracious for once, Tommy,  and say that you'd rather they went with us.
  I know you would.
  Be  gracious, Tommy.
'    'Trotters,' said Mr Codlin, who talked very slowly and ate very  greedily, as is not uncommon with philosophers and misanthropes;  'you're too free.
'    'Why what harm can it do?' urged the other.
    'No harm at all in this particular case, perhaps,' replied Mr Codlin;  'but the principle's a dangerous one, and you're too free I tell you.
'    'Well, are they to go with us or not?'    'Yes, they are,' said Mr Codlin; 'but you might have made a favour of  it, mightn't you?'    The real name of the little man was Harris, but it had gradually merged  into the less euphonious one of Trotters, which, with the prefatory  adjective, Short, had been conferred upon him by reason of the small  size of his legs.
  Short Trotters however, being a compound name,  inconvenient of use in friendly dialogue, the gentleman on whom it had  been bestowed was known among his intimates either as 'Short,' or  'Trotters,' and was seldom accosted at full length as Short Trotters,  except in formal conversations and on occasions of ceremony.
    Short, then, or Trotters, as the reader pleases, returned unto the  remonstrance of his friend Mr Thomas Codlin a jocose answer calculated  to turn aside his discontent; and applying himself with great relish to  the cold boiled beef, the tea, and bread and butter, strongly impressed  upon his companions that they should do the like.
  Mr Codlin indeed  required no such persuasion, as he had already eaten as much as he  could possibly carry and was now moistening his clay with strong ale,  whereof he took deep draughts with a silent relish and invited nobody  to partake--thus again strongly indicating his misanthropical turn of  mind.
    Breakfast being at length over, Mr Codlin called the bill, and charging  the ale to the company generally (a practice also savouring of  misanthropy) divided the sum-total into two fair and equal parts,  assigning one moiety to himself and friend, and the other to Nelly and  her grandfather.
  These being duly discharged and all things ready for  their departure, they took farewell of the landlord and landlady and  resumed their journey.
    And here Mr Codlin's false position in society and the effect it  wrought upon his wounded spirit, were strongly illustrated; for whereas  he had been last night accosted by Mr Punch as 'master,' and had by  inference left the audience to understand that he maintained that  individual for his own luxurious entertainment and delight, here he  was, now, painfully walking beneath the burden of that same Punch's  temple, and bearing it bodily upon his shoulders on a sultry day and  along a dusty road.
  In place of enlivening his patron with a constant  fire of wit or the cheerful rattle of his quarter-staff on the heads of  his relations and acquaintance, here was that beaming Punch utterly  devoid of spine, all slack and drooping in a dark box, with his legs  doubled up round his neck, and not one of his social qualities  remaining.
    Mr Codlin trudged heavily on, exchanging a word or two at intervals  with Short, and stopping to rest and growl occasionally.
  Short led the  way; with the flat box, the private luggage (which was not extensive)  tied up in a bundle, and a brazen trumpet slung from his  shoulder-blade.
  Nell and her grandfather walked next him on either  hand, and Thomas Codlin brought up the rear.
    When they came to any town or village, or even to a detached house of  good appearance, Short blew a blast upon the brazen trumpet and  carolled a fragment of a song in that hilarious tone common to Punches  and their consorts.
  If people hurried to the windows, Mr Codlin  pitched the temple, and hastily unfurling the drapery and concealing  Short therewith, flourished hysterically on the pipes and performed an  air.
  Then the entertainment began as soon as might be; Mr Codlin  having the responsibility of deciding on its length and of protracting  or expediting the time for the hero's final triumph over the enemy of  mankind, according as he judged that the after-crop of half-pence would  be plentiful or scant.
  When it had been gathered in to the last  farthing, he resumed his load and on they went again.
    Sometimes they played out the toll across a bridge or ferry, and once  exhibited by particular desire at a turnpike, where the collector,  being drunk in his solitude, paid down a shilling to have it to  himself.
  There was one small place of rich promise in which their  hopes were blighted, for a favourite character in the play having  gold-lace upon his coat and being a meddling wooden-headed fellow was  held to be a libel on the beadle, for which reason the authorities  enforced a quick retreat; but they were generally well received, and  seldom left a town without a troop of ragged children shouting at their  heels.
    They made a long day's journey, despite these interruptions, and were  yet upon the road when the moon was shining in the sky.
  Short beguiled  the time with songs and jests, and made the best of everything that  happened.
  Mr Codlin on the other hand, cursed his fate, and all the  hollow things of earth (but Punch especially), and limped along with  the theatre on his back, a prey to the bitterest chagrin.
    They had stopped to rest beneath a finger-post where four roads met,  and Mr Codlin in his deep misanthropy had let down the drapery and  seated himself in the bottom of the show, invisible to mortal eyes and  disdainful of the company of his fellow creatures, when two monstrous  shadows were seen stalking towards them from a turning in the road by  which they had come.
  The child was at first quite terrified by the  sight of these gaunt giants--for such they looked as they advanced with  lofty strides beneath the shadow of the trees--but Short, telling her  there was nothing to fear, blew a blast upon the trumpet, which was  answered by a cheerful shout.
    'It's Grinder's lot, an't it?' cried Mr Short in a loud key.
    'Yes,' replied a couple of shrill voices.
    'Come on then,' said Short.
  'Let's have a look at you.
  I thought it  was you.
'    Thus invited, 'Grinder's lot' approached with redoubled speed and soon  came up with the little party.
    Mr Grinder's company, familiarly termed a lot, consisted of a young  gentleman and a young lady on stilts, and Mr Grinder himself, who used  his natural legs for pedestrian purposes and carried at his back a  drum.
  The public costume of the young people was of the Highland kind,  but the night being damp and cold, the young gentleman wore over his  kilt a man's pea jacket reaching to his ankles, and a glazed hat; the  young lady too was muffled in an old cloth pelisse and had a  handkerchief tied about her head.
  Their Scotch bonnets, ornamented  with plumes of jet black feathers, Mr Grinder carried on his instrument.
    'Bound for the races, I see,' said Mr Grinder coming up out of breath.
  'So are we.
  How are you, Short?'  With that they shook hands in a very  friendly manner.
  The young people being too high up for the ordinary  salutations, saluted Short after their own fashion.
  The young  gentleman twisted up his right stilt and patted him on the shoulder,  and the young lady rattled her tambourine.
    'Practice?' said Short, pointing to the stilts.
    'No,' returned Grinder.
  'It comes either to walkin' in 'em or carryin'  of 'em, and they like walkin' in 'em best.
  It's wery pleasant for the  prospects.
  Which road are you takin'?  We go the nighest.
'    'Why, the fact is,' said Short, 'that we are going the longest way,  because then we could stop for the night, a mile and a half on.
  But  three or four mile gained to-night is so many saved to-morrow, and if  you keep on, I think our best way is to do the same.
'    'Where's your partner?' inquired Grinder.
    'Here he is,' cried Mr Thomas Codlin, presenting his head and face in  the proscenium of the stage, and exhibiting an expression of  countenance not often seen there; 'and he'll see his partner boiled  alive before he'll go on to-night.
  That's what he says.
'    'Well, don't say such things as them, in a spear which is dewoted to  something pleasanter,' urged Short.
  'Respect associations, Tommy, even  if you do cut up rough.
'    'Rough or smooth,' said Mr Codlin, beating his hand on the little  footboard where Punch, when suddenly struck with the symmetry of his  legs and their capacity for silk stockings, is accustomed to exhibit  them to popular admiration, 'rough or smooth, I won't go further than  the mile and a half to-night.
  I put up at the Jolly Sandboys and  nowhere else.
  If you like to come there, come there.
  If you like to  go on by yourself, go on by yourself, and do without me if you can.
'    So saying, Mr Codlin disappeared from the scene and immediately  presented himself outside the theatre, took it on his shoulders at a  jerk, and made off with most remarkable agility.
    Any further controversy being now out of the question, Short was fain  to part with Mr Grinder and his pupils and to follow his morose  companion.
  After lingering at the finger-post for a few minutes to see  the stilts frisking away in the moonlight and the bearer of the drum  toiling slowly after them, he blew a few notes upon the trumpet as a  parting salute, and hastened with all speed to follow Mr Codlin.
  With  this view he gave his unoccupied hand to Nell, and bidding her be of  good cheer as they would soon be at the end of their journey for that  night, and stimulating the old man with a similar assurance, led them  at a pretty swift pace towards their destination, which he was the less  unwilling to make for, as the moon was now overcast and the clouds were  threatening rain.
              The Jolly Sandboys was a small road-side inn of pretty ancient date,  with a sign, representing three Sandboys increasing their jollity with  as many jugs of ale and bags of gold, creaking and swinging on its post  on the opposite side of the road.
  As the travellers had observed that  day many indications of their drawing nearer and nearer to the race  town, such as gipsy camps, carts laden with gambling booths and their  appurtenances, itinerant showmen of various kinds, and beggars and  trampers of every degree, all wending their way in the same direction,  Mr Codlin was fearful of finding the accommodations forestalled; this  fear increasing as he diminished the distance between himself and the  hostelry, he quickened his pace, and notwithstanding the burden he had  to carry, maintained a round trot until he reached the threshold.
  Here  he had the gratification of finding that his fears were without  foundation, for the landlord was leaning against the door-post looking  lazily at the rain, which had by this time begun to descend heavily,  and no tinkling of cracked bell, nor boisterous shout, nor noisy  chorus, gave note of company within.
    'All alone?' said Mr Codlin, putting down his burden and wiping his  forehead.
    'All alone as yet,' rejoined the landlord, glancing at the sky, 'but we  shall have more company to-night I expect.
  Here one of you boys, carry  that show into the barn.
  Make haste in out of the wet, Tom; when it  came on to rain I told 'em to make the fire up, and there's a glorious  blaze in the kitchen, I can tell you.
'    Mr Codlin followed with a willing mind, and soon found that the  landlord had not commended his preparations without good reason.
  A  mighty fire was blazing on the hearth and roaring up the wide chimney  with a cheerful sound, which a large iron cauldron, bubbling and  simmering in the heat, lent its pleasant aid to swell.
  There was a  deep red ruddy blush upon the room, and when the landlord stirred the  fire, sending the flames skipping and leaping up--when he took off the  lid of the iron pot and there rushed out a savoury smell, while the  bubbling sound grew deeper and more rich, and an unctuous steam came  floating out, hanging in a delicious mist above their heads--when he  did this, Mr Codlin's heart was touched.
  He sat down in the  chimney-corner and smiled.
    Mr Codlin sat smiling in the chimney-corner, eyeing the landlord as  with a roguish look he held the cover in his hand, and, feigning that  his doing so was needful to the welfare of the cookery, suffered the  delightful steam to tickle the nostrils of his guest.
  The glow of the  fire was upon the landlord's bald head, and upon his twinkling eye, and  upon his watering mouth, and upon his pimpled face, and upon his round  fat figure.
  Mr Codlin drew his sleeve across his lips, and said in a  murmuring voice, 'What is it?'    'It's a stew of tripe,' said the landlord smacking his lips, 'and  cow-heel,' smacking them again, 'and bacon,' smacking them once more,  'and steak,' smacking them for the fourth time, 'and peas,  cauliflowers, new potatoes, and sparrow-grass, all working up together  in one delicious gravy.
'  Having come to the climax, he smacked his  lips a great many times, and taking a long hearty sniff of the  fragrance that was hovering about, put on the cover again with the air  of one whose toils on earth were over.
    'At what time will it be ready?' asked Mr Codlin faintly.
    'It'll be done to a turn,' said the landlord looking up to the  clock--and the very clock had a colour in its fat white face, and  looked a clock for jolly Sandboys to consult--'it'll be done to a turn  at twenty-two minutes before eleven.
'    'Then,' said Mr Codlin, 'fetch me a pint of warm ale, and don't let  nobody bring into the room even so much as a biscuit till the time  arrives.
'    Nodding his approval of this decisive and manly course of procedure,  the landlord retired to draw the beer, and presently returning with it,  applied himself to warm the same in a small tin vessel shaped  funnel-wise, for the convenience of sticking it far down in the fire  and getting at the bright places.
  This was soon done, and he handed it  over to Mr Codlin with that creamy froth upon the surface which is one  of the happy circumstances attendant on mulled malt.
    Greatly softened by this soothing beverage, Mr Codlin now bethought him  of his companions, and acquainted mine host of the Sandboys that their  arrival might be shortly looked for.
  The rain was rattling against the  windows and pouring down in torrents, and such was Mr Codlin's extreme  amiability of mind, that he more than once expressed his earnest hope  that they would not be so foolish as to get wet.
    At length they arrived, drenched with the rain and presenting a most  miserable appearance, notwithstanding that Short had sheltered the  child as well as he could under the skirts of his own coat, and they  were nearly breathless from the haste they had made.
  But their steps  were no sooner heard upon the road than the landlord, who had been at  the outer door anxiously watching for their coming, rushed into the  kitchen and took the cover off.
  The effect was electrical.
  They all  came in with smiling faces though the wet was dripping from their  clothes upon the floor, and Short's first remark was, 'What a delicious  smell!'    It is not very difficult to forget rain and mud by the side of a  cheerful fire, and in a bright room.
  They were furnished with slippers  and such dry garments as the house or their own bundles afforded, and  ensconcing themselves, as Mr Codlin had already done, in the warm  chimney-corner, soon forgot their late troubles or only remembered them  as enhancing the delights of the present time.
  Overpowered by the  warmth and comfort and the fatigue they had undergone, Nelly and the  old man had not long taken their seats here, when they fell asleep.
    'Who are they?' whispered the landlord.
    Short shook his head, and wished he knew himself.
    'Don't you know?' asked the host, turning to Mr Codlin.
    'Not I,' he replied.
  'They're no good, I suppose.
'    'They're no harm,' said Short.
  'Depend upon that.
  I tell you  what--it's plain that the old man an't in his right mind--'    'If you haven't got anything newer than that to say,' growled Mr  Codlin, glancing at the clock, 'you'd better let us fix our minds upon  the supper, and not disturb us.
'    'Hear me out, won't you?' retorted his friend.
  'It's very plain to me,  besides, that they're not used to this way of life.
  Don't tell me that  that handsome child has been in the habit of prowling about as she's  done these last two or three days.
  I know better.
'    'Well, who DOES tell you she has?' growled Mr Codlin, again glancing at  the clock and from it to the cauldron, 'can't you think of anything  more suitable to present circumstances than saying things and then  contradicting 'em?'    'I wish somebody would give you your supper,' returned Short, 'for  there'll be no peace till you've got it.
  Have you seen how anxious the  old man is to get on--always wanting to be furder away--furder away.
  Have you seen that?'    'Ah! what then?' muttered Thomas Codlin.
    'This, then,' said Short.
  'He has given his friends the slip.
  Mind  what I say--he has given his friends the slip, and persuaded this  delicate young creetur all along of her fondness for him to be his  guide and travelling companion--where to, he knows no more than the man  in the moon.
  Now I'm not a going to stand that.
'    'YOU'RE not a going to stand that!' cried Mr Codlin, glancing at the  clock again and pulling his hair with both hands in a kind of frenzy,  but whether occasioned by his companion's observation or the tardy pace  of Time, it was difficult to determine.
  'Here's a world to live in!'    'I,' repeated Short emphatically and slowly, 'am not a-going to stand  it.
  I am not a-going to see this fair young child a falling into bad  hands, and getting among people that she's no more fit for, than they  are to get among angels as their ordinary chums.
  Therefore when they  dewelope an intention of parting company from us, I shall take measures  for detaining of 'em, and restoring 'em to their friends, who I dare  say have had their disconsolation pasted up on every wall in London by  this time.
'    'Short,' said Mr Codlin, who with his head upon his hands, and his  elbows on his knees, had been shaking himself impatiently from side to  side up to this point and occasionally stamping on the ground, but who  now looked up with eager eyes; 'it's possible that there may be  uncommon good sense in what you've said.
  If there is, and there should  be a reward, Short, remember that we're partners in everything!'    His companion had only time to nod a brief assent to this position, for  the child awoke at the instant.
  They had drawn close together during  the previous whispering, and now hastily separated and were rather  awkwardly endeavouring to exchange some casual remarks in their usual  tone, when strange footsteps were heard without, and fresh company  entered.
    These were no other than four very dismal dogs, who came pattering in  one after the other, headed by an old bandy dog of particularly  mournful aspect, who, stopping when the last of his followers had got  as far as the door, erected himself upon his hind legs and looked round  at his companions, who immediately stood upon their hind legs, in a  grave and melancholy row.
  Nor was this the only remarkable  circumstance about these dogs, for each of them wore a kind of little  coat of some gaudy colour trimmed with tarnished spangles, and one of  them had a cap upon his head, tied very carefully under his chin, which  had fallen down upon his nose and completely obscured one eye; add to  this, that the gaudy coats were all wet through and discoloured with  rain, and that the wearers were splashed and dirty, and some idea may  be formed of the unusual appearance of these new visitors to the Jolly  Sandboys.
    Neither Short nor the landlord nor Thomas Codlin, however, was in the  least surprised, merely remarking that these were Jerry's dogs and that  Jerry could not be far behind.
  So there the dogs stood, patiently  winking and gaping and looking extremely hard at the boiling pot, until  Jerry himself appeared, when they all dropped down at once and walked  about the room in their natural manner.
  This posture it must be  confessed did not much improve their appearance, as their own personal  tails and their coat tails--both capital things in their way--did not  agree together.
    Jerry, the manager of these dancing dogs, was a tall black-whiskered  man in a velveteen coat, who seemed well known to the landlord and his  guests and accosted them with great cordiality.
  Disencumbering himself  of a barrel organ which he placed upon a chair, and retaining in his  hand a small whip wherewith to awe his company of comedians, he came up  to the fire to dry himself, and entered into conversation.
    'Your people don't usually travel in character, do they?' said Short,  pointing to the dresses of the dogs.
  'It must come expensive if they  do?'    'No,' replied Jerry, 'no, it's not the custom with us.
  But we've been  playing a little on the road to-day, and we come out with a new  wardrobe at the races, so I didn't think it worth while to stop to  undress.
  Down, Pedro!'    This was addressed to the dog with the cap on, who being a new member  of the company, and not quite certain of his duty, kept his unobscured  eye anxiously on his master, and was perpetually starting upon his hind  legs when there was no occasion, and falling down again.
    'I've got a animal here,' said Jerry, putting his hand into the  capacious pocket of his coat, and diving into one corner as if he were  feeling for a small orange or an apple or some such article, 'a animal  here, wot I think you know something of, Short.
'    'Ah!' cried Short, 'let's have a look at him.
'    'Here he is,' said Jerry, producing a little terrier from his pocket.
  'He was once a Toby of yours, warn't he!'    In some versions of the great drama of Punch there is a small dog--a  modern innovation--supposed to be the private property of that  gentleman, whose name is always Toby.
  This Toby has been stolen in  youth from another gentleman, and fraudulently sold to the confiding  hero, who having no guile himself has no suspicion that it lurks in  others; but Toby, entertaining a grateful recollection of his old  master, and scorning to attach himself to any new patrons, not only  refuses to smoke a pipe at the bidding of Punch, but to mark his old  fidelity more strongly, seizes him by the nose and wrings the same with  violence, at which instance of canine attachment the spectators are  deeply affected.
  This was the character which the little terrier in  question had once sustained; if there had been any doubt upon the  subject he would speedily have resolved it by his conduct; for not only  did he, on seeing Short, give the strongest tokens of recognition, but  catching sight of the flat box he barked so furiously at the pasteboard  nose which he knew was inside, that his master was obliged to gather  him up and put him into his pocket again, to the great relief of the  whole company.
    The landlord now busied himself in laying the cloth, in which process  Mr Codlin obligingly assisted by setting forth his own knife and fork  in the most convenient place and establishing himself behind them.
  When everything was ready, the landlord took off the cover for the last  time, and then indeed there burst forth such a goodly promise of  supper, that if he had offered to put it on again or had hinted at  postponement, he would certainly have been sacrificed on his own hearth.
    However, he did nothing of the kind, but instead thereof assisted a  stout servant girl in turning the contents of the cauldron into a large  tureen; a proceeding which the dogs, proof against various hot splashes  which fell upon their noses, watched with terrible eagerness.
  At  length the dish was lifted on the table, and mugs of ale having been  previously set round, little Nell ventured to say grace, and supper  began.
    At this juncture the poor dogs were standing on their hind legs quite  surprisingly; the child, having pity on them, was about to cast some  morsels of food to them before she tasted it herself, hungry though she  was, when their master interposed.
    'No, my dear, no, not an atom from anybody's hand but mine if you  please.
  That dog,' said Jerry, pointing out the old leader of the  troop, and speaking in a terrible voice, 'lost a halfpenny to-day.
  He  goes without his supper.
'    The unfortunate creature dropped upon his fore-legs directly, wagged  his tail, and looked imploringly at his master.
    'You must be more careful, Sir,' said Jerry, walking coolly to the  chair where he had placed the organ, and setting the stop.
  'Come here.
  Now, Sir, you play away at that, while we have supper, and leave off if  you dare.
'    The dog immediately began to grind most mournful music.
  His master  having shown him the whip resumed his seat and called up the others,  who, at his directions, formed in a row, standing upright as a file of  soldiers.
    'Now, gentlemen,' said Jerry, looking at them attentively.
  'The dog  whose name's called, eats.
  The dogs whose names an't called, keep  quiet.
  Carlo!'    The lucky individual whose name was called, snapped up the morsel  thrown towards him, but none of the others moved a muscle.
  In this  manner they were fed at the discretion of their master.
  Meanwhile the  dog in disgrace ground hard at the organ, sometimes in quick time,  sometimes in slow, but never leaving off for an instant.
  When the  knives and forks rattled very much, or any of his fellows got an  unusually large piece of fat, he accompanied the music with a short  howl, but he immediately checked it on his master looking round, and  applied himself with increased diligence to the Old Hundredth.
              Supper was not yet over, when there arrived at the Jolly Sandboys two  more travellers bound for the same haven as the rest, who had been  walking in the rain for some hours, and came in shining and heavy with  water.
  One of these was the proprietor of a giant, and a little lady  without legs or arms, who had jogged forward in a van; the other, a  silent gentleman who earned his living by showing tricks upon the  cards, and who had rather deranged the natural expression of his  countenance by putting small leaden lozenges into his eyes and bringing  them out at his mouth, which was one of his professional  accomplishments.
  The name of the first of these newcomers was Vuffin;  the other, probably as a pleasant satire upon his ugliness, was called  Sweet William.
  To render them as comfortable as he could, the landlord  bestirred himself nimbly, and in a very short time both gentlemen were  perfectly at their ease.
    'How's the Giant?' said Short, when they all sat smoking round the fire.
    'Rather weak upon his legs,' returned Mr Vuffin.
  'I begin to be afraid  he's going at the knees.
'    'That's a bad look-out,' said Short.
    'Aye!  Bad indeed,' replied Mr Vuffin, contemplating the fire with a  sigh.
  'Once get a giant shaky on his legs, and the public care no more  about him than they do for a dead cabbage stalk.
'    'What becomes of old giants?' said Short, turning to him again after a  little reflection.
    'They're usually kept in carawans to wait upon the dwarfs,' said Mr  Vuffin.
    'The maintaining of 'em must come expensive, when they can't be shown,  eh?' remarked Short, eyeing him doubtfully.
    'It's better that, than letting 'em go upon the parish or about the  streets,' said Mr Vuffin.
  'Once make a giant common and giants will  never draw again.
  Look at wooden legs.
  If there was only one man with  a wooden leg what a property he'd be!'    'So he would!' observed the landlord and Short both together.
  'That's  very true.
'    'Instead of which,' pursued Mr Vuffin, 'if you was to advertise  Shakspeare played entirely by wooden legs, it's my belief you wouldn't  draw a sixpence.
'    'I don't suppose you would,' said Short.
  And the landlord said so too.
    'This shows, you see,' said Mr Vuffin, waving his pipe with an  argumentative air, 'this shows the policy of keeping the used-up giants  still in the carawans, where they get food and lodging for nothing, all  their lives, and in general very glad they are to stop there.
  There  was one giant--a black 'un--as left his carawan some year ago and took  to carrying coach-bills about London, making himself as cheap as  crossing-sweepers.
  He died.
  I make no insinuation against anybody in  particular,' said Mr Vuffin, looking solemnly round, 'but he was  ruining the trade;--and he died.
'    The landlord drew his breath hard, and looked at the owner of the dogs,  who nodded and said gruffly that he remembered.
    'I know you do, Jerry,' said Mr Vuffin with profound meaning.
  'I know  you remember it, Jerry, and the universal opinion was, that it served  him right.
  Why, I remember the time when old Maunders as had  three-and-twenty wans--I remember the time when old Maunders had in his  cottage in Spa Fields in the winter time, when the season was over,  eight male and female dwarfs setting down to dinner every day, who was  waited on by eight old giants in green coats, red smalls, blue cotton  stockings, and high-lows: and there was one dwarf as had grown elderly  and wicious who whenever his giant wasn't quick enough to please him,  used to stick pins in his legs, not being able to reach up any higher.
  I know that's a fact, for Maunders told it me himself.
'    'What about the dwarfs when they get old?' inquired the landlord.
    'The older a dwarf is, the better worth he is,' returned Mr Vuffin; 'a  grey-headed dwarf, well wrinkled, is beyond all suspicion.
  But a giant  weak in the legs and not standing upright!--keep him in the carawan,  but never show him, never show him, for any persuasion that can be  offered.
'    While Mr Vuffin and his two friends smoked their pipes and beguiled the  time with such conversation as this, the silent gentleman sat in a warm  corner, swallowing, or seeming to swallow, sixpennyworth of halfpence  for practice, balancing a feather upon his nose, and rehearsing other  feats of dexterity of that kind, without paying any regard whatever to  the company, who in their turn left him utterly unnoticed.
  At length  the weary child prevailed upon her grandfather to retire, and they  withdrew, leaving the company yet seated round the fire, and the dogs  fast asleep at a humble distance.
    After bidding the old man good night, Nell retired to her poor garret,  but had scarcely closed the door, when it was gently tapped at.
  She  opened it directly, and was a little startled by the sight of Mr Thomas  Codlin, whom she had left, to all appearance, fast asleep down stairs.
    'What is the matter?' said the child.
    'Nothing's the matter, my dear,' returned her visitor.
  'I'm your  friend.
  Perhaps you haven't thought so, but it's me that's your  friend--not him.
'    'Not who?' the child inquired.
    'Short, my dear.
  I tell you what,' said Codlin, 'for all his having a  kind of way with him that you'd be very apt to like, I'm the real,  open-hearted man.
  I mayn't look it, but I am indeed.
'    The child began to be alarmed, considering that the ale had taken  effect upon Mr Codlin, and that this commendation of himself was the  consequence.
    'Short's very well, and seems kind,' resumed the misanthrope, 'but he  overdoes it.
  Now I don't.
'    Certainly if there were any fault in Mr Codlin's usual deportment, it  was that he rather underdid his kindness to those about him, than  overdid it.
  But the child was puzzled, and could not tell what to say.
    'Take my advice,' said Codlin: 'don't ask me why, but take it.
  As long  as you travel with us, keep as near me as you can.
  Don't offer to  leave us--not on any account--but always stick to me and say that I'm  your friend.
  Will you bear that in mind, my dear, and always say that  it was me that was your friend?'    'Say so where--and when?' inquired the child innocently.
    'O, nowhere in particular,' replied Codlin, a little put out as it  seemed by the question; 'I'm only anxious that you should think me so,  and do me justice.
  You can't think what an interest I have in you.
  Why didn't you tell me your little history--that about you and the poor  old gentleman?  I'm the best adviser that ever was, and so interested  in you--so much more interested than Short.
  I think they're breaking  up down stairs; you needn't tell Short, you know, that we've had this  little talk together.
  God bless you.
  Recollect the friend.
  Codlin's  the friend, not Short.
  Short's very well as far as he goes, but the  real friend is Codlin--not Short.
'    Eking out these professions with a number of benevolent and protecting  looks and great fervour of manner, Thomas Codlin stole away on tiptoe,  leaving the child in a state of extreme surprise.
  She was still  ruminating upon his curious behaviour, when the floor of the crazy  stairs and landing cracked beneath the tread of the other travellers  who were passing to their beds.
  When they had all passed, and the  sound of their footsteps had died away, one of them returned, and after  a little hesitation and rustling in the passage, as if he were doubtful  what door to knock at, knocked at hers.
    'Yes,' said the child from within.
    'It's me--Short'--a voice called through the keyhole.
  'I only wanted  to say that we must be off early to-morrow morning, my dear, because  unless we get the start of the dogs and the conjuror, the villages  won't be worth a penny.
  You'll be sure to be stirring early and go  with us?  I'll call you.
'    The child answered in the affirmative, and returning his 'good night'  heard him creep away.
  She felt some uneasiness at the anxiety of these  men, increased by the recollection of their whispering together down  stairs and their slight confusion when she awoke, nor was she quite  free from a misgiving that they were not the fittest companions she  could have stumbled on.
  Her uneasiness, however, was nothing, weighed  against her fatigue; and she soon forgot it in sleep.
    Very early next morning, Short fulfilled his promise, and knocking  softly at her door, entreated that she would get up directly, as the  proprietor of the dogs was still snoring, and if they lost no time they  might get a good deal in advance both of him and the conjuror, who was  talking in his sleep, and from what he could be heard to say, appeared  to be balancing a donkey in his dreams.
  She started from her bed  without delay, and roused the old man with so much expedition that they  were both ready as soon as Short himself, to that gentleman's  unspeakable gratification and relief.
    After a very unceremonious and scrambling breakfast, of which the  staple commodities were bacon and bread, and beer, they took leave of  the landlord and issued from the door of the jolly Sandboys.
  The  morning was fine and warm, the ground cool to the feet after the late  rain, the hedges gayer and more green, the air clear, and everything  fresh and healthful.
  Surrounded by these influences, they walked on  pleasantly enough.
    They had not gone very far, when the child was again struck by the  altered behaviour of Mr Thomas Codlin, who instead of plodding on  sulkily by himself as he had heretofore done, kept close to her, and  when he had an opportunity of looking at her unseen by his companion,  warned her by certain wry faces and jerks of the head not to put any  trust in Short, but to reserve all confidences for Codlin.
  Neither did  he confine himself to looks and gestures, for when she and her  grandfather were walking on beside the aforesaid Short, and that little  man was talking with his accustomed cheerfulness on a variety of  indifferent subjects, Thomas Codlin testified his jealousy and distrust  by following close at her heels, and occasionally admonishing her  ankles with the legs of the theatre in a very abrupt and painful manner.
    All these proceedings naturally made the child more watchful and  suspicious, and she soon observed that whenever they halted to perform  outside a village alehouse or other place, Mr Codlin while he went  through his share of the entertainments kept his eye steadily upon her  and the old man, or with a show of great friendship and consideration  invited the latter to lean upon his arm, and so held him tight until  the representation was over and they again went forward.
  Even Short  seemed to change in this respect, and to mingle with his good-nature  something of a desire to keep them in safe custody.
  This increased the  child's misgivings, and made her yet more anxious and uneasy.
    Meanwhile, they were drawing near the town where the races were to  begin next day; for, from passing numerous groups of gipsies and  trampers on the road, wending their way towards it, and straggling out  from every by-way and cross-country lane, they gradually fell into a  stream of people, some walking by the side of covered carts, others  with horses, others with donkeys, others toiling on with heavy loads  upon their backs, but all tending to the same point.
  The public-houses  by the wayside, from being empty and noiseless as those in the remoter  parts had been, now sent out boisterous shouts and clouds of smoke;  and, from the misty windows, clusters of broad red faces looked down  upon the road.
  On every piece of waste or common ground, some small  gambler drove his noisy trade, and bellowed to the idle passersby to  stop and try their chance; the crowd grew thicker and more noisy; gilt  gingerbread in blanket-stalls exposed its glories to the dust; and  often a four-horse carriage, dashing by, obscured all objects in the  gritty cloud it raised, and left them, stunned and blinded, far behind.
    It was dark before they reached the town itself, and long indeed the  few last miles had been.
  Here all was tumult and confusion; the  streets were filled with throngs of people--many strangers were there,  it seemed, by the looks they cast about--the church-bells rang out  their noisy peals, and flags streamed from windows and house-tops.
  In  the large inn-yards waiters flitted to and fro and ran against each  other, horses clattered on the uneven stones, carriage steps fell  rattling down, and sickening smells from many dinners came in a heavy  lukewarm breath upon the sense.
  In the smaller public-houses, fiddles  with all their might and main were squeaking out the tune to staggering  feet; drunken men, oblivious of the burden of their song, joined in a  senseless howl, which drowned the tinkling of the feeble bell and made  them savage for their drink; vagabond groups assembled round the doors  to see the stroller woman dance, and add their uproar to the shrill  flageolet and deafening drum.
    Through this delirious scene, the child, frightened and repelled by all  she saw, led on her bewildered charge, clinging close to her conductor,  and trembling lest in the press she should be separated from him and  left to find her way alone.
  Quickening their steps to get clear of all  the roar and riot, they at length passed through the town and made for  the race-course, which was upon an open heath, situated on an eminence,  a full mile distant from its furthest bounds.
    Although there were many people here, none of the best favoured or best  clad, busily erecting tents and driving stakes in the ground, and  hurrying to and fro with dusty feet and many a grumbled oath--although  there were tired children cradled on heaps of straw between the wheels  of carts, crying themselves to sleep--and poor lean horses and donkeys  just turned loose, grazing among the men and women, and pots and  kettles, and half-lighted fires, and ends of candles flaring and  wasting in the air--for all this, the child felt it an escape from the  town and drew her breath more freely.
  After a scanty supper, the  purchase of which reduced her little stock so low, that she had only a  few halfpence with which to buy a breakfast on the morrow, she and the  old man lay down to rest in a corner of a tent, and slept, despite the  busy preparations that were going on around them all night long.
    And now they had come to the time when they must beg their bread.
  Soon  after sunrise in the morning she stole out from the tent, and rambling  into some fields at a short distance, plucked a few wild roses and such  humble flowers, purposing to make them into little nosegays and offer  them to the ladies in the carriages when the company arrived.
  Her  thoughts were not idle while she was thus employed; when she returned  and was seated beside the old man in one corner of the tent, tying her  flowers together, while the two men lay dozing in another corner, she  plucked him by the sleeve, and slightly glancing towards them, said, in  a low voice--    'Grandfather, don't look at those I talk of, and don't seem as if I  spoke of anything but what I am about.
  What was that you told me  before we left the old house?  That if they knew what we were going to  do, they would say that you were mad, and part us?'    The old man turned to her with an aspect of wild terror; but she  checked him by a look, and bidding him hold some flowers while she tied  them up, and so bringing her lips closer to his ear, said--    'I know that was what you told me.
  You needn't speak, dear.
  I  recollect it very well.
  It was not likely that I should forget it.
  Grandfather, these men suspect that we have secretly left our friends,  and mean to carry us before some gentleman and have us taken care of  and sent back.
  If you let your hand tremble so, we can never get away  from them, but if you're only quiet now, we shall do so, easily.
'    'How?' muttered the old man.
  'Dear Nelly, how?  They will shut me up  in a stone room, dark and cold, and chain me up to the wall, Nell--flog  me with whips, and never let me see thee more!'    'You're trembling again,' said the child.
  'Keep close to me all day.
  Never mind them, don't look at them, but me.
  I shall find a time when  we can steal away.
  When I do, mind you come with me, and do not stop  or speak a word.
  Hush!  That's all.
'    'Halloa! what are you up to, my dear?' said Mr Codlin, raising his  head, and yawning.
  Then observing that his companion was fast asleep,  he added in an earnest whisper, 'Codlin's the friend, remember--not  Short.
'    'Making some nosegays,' the child replied; 'I am going to try and sell  some, these three days of the races.
  Will you have one--as a present I  mean?'    Mr Codlin would have risen to receive it, but the child hurried towards  him and placed it in his hand.
  He stuck it in his buttonhole with an  air of ineffable complacency for a misanthrope, and leering exultingly  at the unconscious Short, muttered, as he laid himself down again, 'Tom  Codlin's the friend, by G--!'    As the morning wore on, the tents assumed a gayer and more brilliant  appearance, and long lines of carriages came rolling softly on the  turf.
  Men who had lounged about all night in smock-frocks and leather  leggings, came out in silken vests and hats and plumes, as jugglers or  mountebanks; or in gorgeous liveries as soft-spoken servants at  gambling booths; or in sturdy yeoman dress as decoys at unlawful games.
  Black-eyed gipsy girls, hooded in showy handkerchiefs, sallied forth to  tell fortunes, and pale slender women with consumptive faces lingered  upon the footsteps of ventriloquists and conjurors, and counted the  sixpences with anxious eyes long before they were gained.
  As many of  the children as could be kept within bounds, were stowed away, with all  the other signs of dirt and poverty, among the donkeys, carts, and  horses; and as many as could not be thus disposed of ran in and out in  all intricate spots, crept between people's legs and carriage wheels,  and came forth unharmed from under horses' hoofs.
  The dancing-dogs,  the stilts, the little lady and the tall man, and all the other  attractions, with organs out of number and bands innumerable, emerged  from the holes and corners in which they had passed the night, and  flourished boldly in the sun.
    Along the uncleared course, Short led his party, sounding the brazen  trumpet and revelling in the voice of Punch; and at his heels went  Thomas Codlin, bearing the show as usual, and keeping his eye on Nelly  and her grandfather, as they rather lingered in the rear.
  The child  bore upon her arm the little basket with her flowers, and sometimes  stopped, with timid and modest looks, to offer them at some gay  carriage; but alas! there were many bolder beggars there, gipsies who  promised husbands, and other adepts in their trade, and although some  ladies smiled gently as they shook their heads, and others cried to the  gentlemen beside them 'See, what a pretty face!' they let the pretty  face pass on, and never thought that it looked tired or hungry.
    There was but one lady who seemed to understand the child, and she was  one who sat alone in a handsome carriage, while two young men in  dashing clothes, who had just dismounted from it, talked and laughed  loudly at a little distance, appearing to forget her, quite.
  There  were many ladies all around, but they turned their backs, or looked  another way, or at the two young men (not unfavourably at them), and  left her to herself.
  She motioned away a gipsy-woman urgent to tell  her fortune, saying that it was told already and had been for some  years, but called the child towards her, and taking her flowers put  money into her trembling hand, and bade her go home and keep at home  for God's sake.
    Many a time they went up and down those long, long lines, seeing  everything but the horses and the race; when the bell rang to clear the  course, going back to rest among the carts and donkeys, and not coming  out again until the heat was over.
  Many a time, too, was Punch  displayed in the full zenith of his humour, but all this while the eye  of Thomas Codlin was upon them, and to escape without notice was  impracticable.
    At length, late in the day, Mr Codlin pitched the show in a convenient  spot, and the spectators were soon in the very triumph of the scene.
  The child, sitting down with the old man close behind it, had been  thinking how strange it was that horses who were such fine honest  creatures should seem to make vagabonds of all the men they drew about  them, when a loud laugh at some extemporaneous witticism of Mr Short's,  having allusion to the circumstances of the day, roused her from her  meditation and caused her to look around.
    If they were ever to get away unseen, that was the very moment.
  Short  was plying the quarter-staves vigorously and knocking the characters in  the fury of the combat against the sides of the show, the people were  looking on with laughing faces, and Mr Codlin had relaxed into a grim  smile as his roving eye detected hands going into waistcoat pockets and  groping secretly for sixpences.
  If they were ever to get away unseen,  that was the very moment.
  They seized it, and fled.
    They made a path through booths and carriages and throngs of people,  and never once stopped to look behind.
  The bell was ringing and the  course was cleared by the time they reached the ropes, but they dashed  across it insensible to the shouts and screeching that assailed them  for breaking in upon its sanctity, and creeping under the brow of the  hill at a quick pace, made for the open fields.
              Day after day as he bent his steps homeward, returning from some new  effort to procure employment, Kit raised his eyes to the window of the  little room he had so much commended to the child, and hoped to see  some indication of her presence.
  His own earnest wish, coupled with  the assurance he had received from Quilp, filled him with the belief  that she would yet arrive to claim the humble shelter he had offered,  and from the death of each day's hope another hope sprung up to live  to-morrow.
    'I think they must certainly come to-morrow, eh mother?' said Kit,  laying aside his hat with a weary air and sighing as he spoke.
  'They  have been gone a week.
  They surely couldn't stop away more than a  week, could they now?'    The mother shook her head, and reminded him how often he had been  disappointed already.
    'For the matter of that,' said Kit, 'you speak true and sensible  enough, as you always do, mother.
  Still, I do consider that a week is  quite long enough for 'em to be rambling about; don't you say so?'    'Quite long enough, Kit, longer than enough, but they may not come back  for all that.
'    Kit was for a moment disposed to be vexed by this contradiction, and  not the less so from having anticipated it in his own mind and knowing  how just it was.
  But the impulse was only momentary, and the vexed  look became a kind one before it had crossed the room.
    'Then what do you think, mother, has become of 'em?  You don't think  they've gone to sea, anyhow?'    'Not gone for sailors, certainly,' returned the mother with a smile.
  'But I can't help thinking that they have gone to some foreign country.
'    'I say,' cried Kit with a rueful face, 'don't talk like that, mother.
'    'I am afraid they have, and that's the truth,' she said.
  'It's the  talk of all the neighbours, and there are some even that know of their  having been seen on board ship, and can tell you the name of the place  they've gone to, which is more than I can, my dear, for it's a very  hard one.
'    'I don't believe it,' said Kit.
  'Not a word of it.
  A set of idle  chatterboxes, how should they know!'    'They may be wrong of course,' returned the mother, 'I can't tell about  that, though I don't think it's at all unlikely that they're in the  right, for the talk is that the old gentleman had put by a little money  that nobody knew of, not even that ugly little man you talk to me  about--what's his name--Quilp; and that he and Miss Nell have gone to  live abroad where it can't be taken from them, and they will never be  disturbed.
  That don't seem very far out of the way now, do it?'    Kit scratched his head mournfully, in reluctant admission that it did  not, and clambering up to the old nail took down the cage and set  himself to clean it and to feed the bird.
  His thoughts reverting from  this occupation to the little old gentleman who had given him the  shilling, he suddenly recollected that that was the very day--nay,  nearly the very hour--at which the little old gentleman had said he  should be at the Notary's house again.
  He no sooner remembered this,  than he hung up the cage with great precipitation, and hastily  explaining the nature of his errand, went off at full speed to the  appointed place.
    It was some two minutes after the time when he reached the spot, which  was a considerable distance from his home, but by great good luck the  little old gentleman had not yet arrived; at least there was no  pony-chaise to be seen, and it was not likely that he had come and gone  again in so short a space.
  Greatly relieved to find that he was not  too late, Kit leant against a lamp-post to take breath, and waited the  advent of the pony and his charge.
    Sure enough, before long the pony came trotting round the corner of the  street, looking as obstinate as pony might, and picking his steps as if  he were spying about for the cleanest places, and would by no means  dirty his feet or hurry himself inconveniently.
  Behind the pony sat  the little old gentleman, and by the old gentleman's side sat the  little old lady, carrying just such a nosegay as she had brought before.
    The old gentleman, the old lady, the pony, and the chaise, came up the  street in perfect unanimity, until they arrived within some half a  dozen doors of the Notary's house, when the pony, deceived by a  brass-plate beneath a tailor's knocker, came to a halt, and maintained  by a sturdy silence, that that was the house they wanted.
    'Now, Sir, will you ha' the goodness to go on; this is not the place,'  said the old gentleman.
    The pony looked with great attention into a fire-plug which was near  him, and appeared to be quite absorbed in contemplating it.
    'Oh dear, such a naughty Whisker!' cried the old lady.
  'After being so  good too, and coming along so well!  I am quite ashamed of him.
  I  don't know what we are to do with him, I really don't.
'    The pony having thoroughly satisfied himself as to the nature and  properties of the fire-plug, looked into the air after his old enemies  the flies, and as there happened to be one of them tickling his ear at  that moment he shook his head and whisked his tail, after which he  appeared full of thought but quite comfortable and collected.
  The old  gentleman having exhausted his powers of persuasion, alighted to lead  him; whereupon the pony, perhaps because he held this to be a  sufficient concession, perhaps because he happened to catch sight of  the other brass-plate, or perhaps because he was in a spiteful humour,  darted off with the old lady and stopped at the right house, leaving  the old gentleman to come panting on behind.
    It was then that Kit presented himself at the pony's head, and touched  his hat with a smile.
    'Why, bless me,' cried the old gentleman, 'the lad is here!  My dear,  do you see?'    'I said I'd be here, Sir,' said Kit, patting Whisker's neck.
  'I hope  you've had a pleasant ride, sir.
  He's a very nice little pony.
'    'My dear,' said the old gentleman.
  'This is an uncommon lad; a good  lad, I'm sure.
'    'I'm sure he is,' rejoined the old lady.
  'A very good lad, and I am  sure he is a good son.
'    Kit acknowledged these expressions of confidence by touching his hat  again and blushing very much.
  The old gentleman then handed the old  lady out, and after looking at him with an approving smile, they went  into the house--talking about him as they went, Kit could not help  feeling.
  Presently Mr Witherden, smelling very hard at the nosegay,  came to the window and looked at him, and after that Mr Abel came and  looked at him, and after that the old gentleman and lady came and  looked at him again, and after that they all came and looked at him  together, which Kit, feeling very much embarrassed by, made a pretence  of not observing.
  Therefore he patted the pony more and more; and this  liberty the pony most handsomely permitted.
    The faces had not disappeared from the window many moments, when Mr  Chuckster in his official coat, and with his hat hanging on his head  just as it happened to fall from its peg, appeared upon the pavement,  and telling him he was wanted inside, bade him go in and he would mind  the chaise the while.
  In giving him this direction Mr Chuckster  remarked that he wished that he might be blessed if he could make out  whether he (Kit) was 'precious raw' or 'precious deep,' but intimated  by a distrustful shake of the head, that he inclined to the latter  opinion.
    Kit entered the office in a great tremor, for he was not used to going  among strange ladies and gentlemen, and the tin boxes and bundles of  dusty papers had in his eyes an awful and venerable air.
  Mr Witherden  too was a bustling gentleman who talked loud and fast, and all eyes  were upon him, and he was very shabby.
    'Well, boy,' said Mr Witherden, 'you came to work out that  shilling;--not to get another, hey?'    'No indeed, sir,' replied Kit, taking courage to look up.
  'I never  thought of such a thing.
'    'Father alive?' said the Notary.
    'Dead, sir.
'    'Mother?'    'Yes, sir.
'    'Married again--eh?'    Kit made answer, not without some indignation, that she was a widow  with three children, and that as to her marrying again, if the  gentleman knew her he wouldn't think of such a thing.
  At this reply Mr  Witherden buried his nose in the flowers again, and whispered behind  the nosegay to the old gentleman that he believed the lad was as honest  a lad as need be.
    'Now,' said Mr Garland when they had made some further inquiries of  him, 'I am not going to give you anything--'    'Thank you, sir,' Kit replied; and quite seriously too, for this  announcement seemed to free him from the suspicion which the Notary had  hinted.
    '--But,' resumed the old gentleman, 'perhaps I may want to know  something more about you, so tell me where you live, and I'll put it  down in my pocket-book.
'    Kit told him, and the old gentleman wrote down the address with his  pencil.
  He had scarcely done so, when there was a great uproar in the  street, and the old lady hurrying to the window cried that Whisker had  run away, upon which Kit darted out to the rescue, and the others  followed.
    It seemed that Mr Chuckster had been standing with his hands in his  pockets looking carelessly at the pony, and occasionally insulting him  with such admonitions as 'Stand still,'--'Be quiet,'--'Woa-a-a,' and the  like, which by a pony of spirit cannot be borne.
  Consequently, the  pony being deterred by no considerations of duty or obedience, and not  having before him the slightest fear of the human eye, had at length  started off, and was at that moment rattling down the street--Mr  Chuckster, with his hat off and a pen behind his ear, hanging on in the  rear of the chaise and making futile attempts to draw it the other way,  to the unspeakable admiration of all beholders.
  Even in running away,  however, Whisker was perverse, for he had not gone very far when he  suddenly stopped, and before assistance could be rendered, commenced  backing at nearly as quick a pace as he had gone forward.
  By these  means Mr Chuckster was pushed and hustled to the office again, in a  most inglorious manner, and arrived in a state of great exhaustion and  discomfiture.
    The old lady then stepped into her seat, and Mr Abel (whom they had  come to fetch) into his.
  The old gentleman, after reasoning with the  pony on the extreme impropriety of his conduct, and making the best  amends in his power to Mr Chuckster, took his place also, and they  drove away, waving a farewell to the Notary and his clerk, and more  than once turning to nod kindly to Kit as he watched them from the road.
              Kit turned away and very soon forgot the pony, and the chaise, and the  little old lady, and the little old gentleman, and the little young  gentleman to boot, in thinking what could have become of his late  master and his lovely grandchild, who were the fountain-head of all his  meditations.
  Still casting about for some plausible means of  accounting for their non-appearance, and of persuading himself that  they must soon return, he bent his steps towards home, intending to  finish the task which the sudden recollection of his contract had  interrupted, and then to sally forth once more to seek his fortune for  the day.
    When he came to the corner of the court in which he lived, lo and  behold there was the pony again!  Yes, there he was, looking more  obstinate than ever; and alone in the chaise, keeping a steady watch  upon his every wink, sat Mr Abel, who, lifting up his eyes by chance  and seeing Kit pass by, nodded to him as though he would have nodded  his head off.
    Kit wondered to see the pony again, so near his own home too, but it  never occurred to him for what purpose the pony might have come there,  or where the old lady and the old gentleman had gone, until he lifted  the latch of the door, and walking in, found them seated in the room in  conversation with his mother, at which unexpected sight he pulled off  his hat and made his best bow in some confusion.
    'We are here before you, you see, Christopher,' said Mr Garland smiling.
    'Yes, sir,' said Kit; and as he said it, he looked towards his mother  for an explanation of the visit.
    'The gentleman's been kind enough, my dear,' said she, in reply to this  mute interrogation, 'to ask me whether you were in a good place, or in  any place at all, and when I told him no, you were not in any, he was  so good as to say that--'    '--That we wanted a good lad in our house,' said the old gentleman and  the old lady both together, 'and that perhaps we might think of it, if  we found everything as we would wish it to be.
'    As this thinking of it, plainly meant the thinking of engaging Kit, he  immediately partook of his mother's anxiety and fell into a great  flutter; for the little old couple were very methodical and cautious,  and asked so many questions that he began to be afraid there was no  chance of his success.
    'You see, my good woman,' said Mrs Garland to Kit's mother, 'that it's  necessary to be very careful and particular in such a matter as this,  for we're only three in family, and are very quiet regular folks, and  it would be a sad thing if we made any kind of mistake, and found  things different from what we hoped and expected.
'    To this, Kit's mother replied, that certainly it was quite true, and  quite right, and quite proper, and Heaven forbid that she should  shrink, or have cause to shrink, from any inquiry into her character or  that of her son, who was a very good son though she was his mother, in  which respect, she was bold to say, he took after his father, who was  not only a good son to HIS mother, but the best of husbands and the  best of fathers besides, which Kit could and would corroborate she  knew, and so would little Jacob and the baby likewise if they were old  enough, which unfortunately they were not, though as they didn't know  what a loss they had had, perhaps it was a great deal better that they  should be as young as they were; and so Kit's mother wound up a long  story by wiping her eyes with her apron, and patting little Jacob's  head, who was rocking the cradle and staring with all his might at the  strange lady and gentleman.
    When Kit's mother had done speaking, the old lady struck in again, and  said that she was quite sure she was a very honest and very respectable  person or she never would have expressed herself in that manner, and  that certainly the appearance of the children and the cleanliness of  the house deserved great praise and did her the utmost credit, whereat  Kit's mother dropped a curtsey and became consoled.
  Then the good  woman entered in a long and minute account of Kit's life and history  from the earliest period down to that time, not omitting to make  mention of his miraculous fall out of a back-parlour window when an  infant of tender years, or his uncommon sufferings in a state of  measles, which were illustrated by correct imitations of the plaintive  manner in which he called for toast and water, day and night, and said,  'don't cry, mother, I shall soon be better;' for proof of which  statements reference was made to Mrs Green, lodger, at the  cheesemonger's round the corner, and divers other ladies and gentlemen  in various parts of England and Wales (and one Mr Brown who was  supposed to be then a corporal in the East Indies, and who could of  course be found with very little trouble), within whose personal  knowledge the circumstances had occurred.
  This narration ended, Mr  Garland put some questions to Kit respecting his qualifications and  general acquirements, while Mrs Garland noticed the children, and  hearing from Kit's mother certain remarkable circumstances which had  attended the birth of each, related certain other remarkable  circumstances which had attended the birth of her own son, Mr Abel,  from which it appeared that both Kit's mother and herself had been,  above and beyond all other women of what condition or age soever,  peculiarly hemmed in with perils and dangers.
  Lastly, inquiry was made  into the nature and extent of Kit's wardrobe, and a small advance being  made to improve the same, he was formally hired at an annual income of  Six Pounds, over and above his board and lodging, by Mr and Mrs  Garland, of Abel Cottage, Finchley.
    It would be difficult to say which party appeared most pleased with  this arrangement, the conclusion of which was hailed with nothing but  pleasant looks and cheerful smiles on both sides.
  It was settled that  Kit should repair to his new abode on the next day but one, in the  morning; and finally, the little old couple, after bestowing a bright  half-crown on little Jacob and another on the baby, took their leaves;  being escorted as far as the street by their new attendant, who held  the obdurate pony by the bridle while they took their seats, and saw  them drive away with a lightened heart.
    'Well, mother,' said Kit, hurrying back into the house, 'I think my  fortune's about made now.
'    'I should think it was indeed, Kit,' rejoined his mother.
  'Six pound a  year!  Only think!'    'Ah!' said Kit, trying to maintain the gravity which the consideration  of such a sum demanded, but grinning with delight in spite of himself.
  'There's a property!'    Kit drew a long breath when he had said this, and putting his hands  deep into his pockets as if there were one year's wages at least in  each, looked at his mother, as though he saw through her, and down an  immense perspective of sovereigns beyond.
    'Please God we'll make such a lady of you for Sundays, mother! such a  scholar of Jacob, such a child of the baby, such a room of the one up  stairs!  Six pound a year!'    'Hem!' croaked a strange voice.
  'What's that about six pound a year?  What about six pound a year?'  And as the voice made this inquiry,  Daniel Quilp walked in with Richard Swiveller at his heels.
    'Who said he was to have six pound a year?' said Quilp, looking sharply  round.
  'Did the old man say it, or did little Nell say it?  And what's  he to have it for, and where are they, eh!'    The good woman was so much alarmed by the sudden apparition of this  unknown piece of ugliness, that she hastily caught the baby from its  cradle and retreated into the furthest corner of the room; while little  Jacob, sitting upon his stool with his hands on his knees, looked full  at him in a species of fascination, roaring lustily all the time.
  Richard Swiveller took an easy observation of the family over Mr Quilp's  head, and Quilp himself, with his hands in his pockets, smiled in an  exquisite enjoyment of the commotion he occasioned.
    'Don't be frightened, mistress,' said Quilp, after a pause.
  'Your son  knows me; I don't eat babies; I don't like 'em.
  It will be as well to  stop that young screamer though, in case I should be tempted to do him  a mischief.
  Holloa, sir!  Will you be quiet?'    Little Jacob stemmed the course of two tears which he was squeezing out  of his eyes, and instantly subsided into a silent horror.
    'Mind you don't break out again, you villain,' said Quilp, looking  sternly at him, 'or I'll make faces at you and throw you into fits, I  will.
  Now you sir, why haven't you been to me as you promised?'    'What should I come for?' retorted Kit.
  'I hadn't any business with  you, no more than you had with me.
'    'Here, mistress,' said Quilp, turning quickly away, and appealing from  Kit to his mother.
  'When did his old master come or send here last?  Is he here now?  If not, where's he gone?'    'He has not been here at all,' she replied.
  'I wish we knew where they  have gone, for it would make my son a good deal easier in his mind, and  me too.
  If you're the gentleman named Mr Quilp, I should have thought  you'd have known, and so I told him only this very day.
'    'Humph!' muttered Quilp, evidently disappointed to believe that this  was true.
  'That's what you tell this gentleman too, is it?'    'If the gentleman comes to ask the same question, I can't tell him  anything else, sir; and I only wish I could, for our own sakes,' was  the reply.
    Quilp glanced at Richard Swiveller, and observed that having met him on  the threshold, he assumed that he had come in search of some  intelligence of the fugitives.
  He supposed he was right?    'Yes,' said Dick, 'that was the object of the present expedition.
  I  fancied it possible--but let us go ring fancy's knell.
  I'll begin it.
'    'You seem disappointed,' observed Quilp.
    'A baffler, Sir, a baffler, that's all,' returned Dick.
  'I have  entered upon a speculation which has proved a baffler; and a Being of  brightness and beauty will be offered up a sacrifice at Cheggs's altar.
  That's all, sir.
'    The dwarf eyed Richard with a sarcastic smile, but Richard, who had  been taking a rather strong lunch with a friend, observed him not, and  continued to deplore his fate with mournful and despondent looks.
  Quilp plainly discerned that there was some secret reason for this  visit and his uncommon disappointment, and, in the hope that there  might be means of mischief lurking beneath it, resolved to worm it out.
  He had no sooner adopted this resolution, than he conveyed as much  honesty into his face as it was capable of expressing, and sympathised  with Mr Swiveller exceedingly.
    'I am disappointed myself,' said Quilp, 'out of mere friendly feeling  for them; but you have real reasons, private reasons I have no doubt,  for your disappointment, and therefore it comes heavier than mine.
'    'Why, of course it does,' Dick observed, testily.
    'Upon my word, I'm very sorry, very sorry.
  I'm rather cast down  myself.
  As we are companions in adversity, shall we be companions in  the surest way of forgetting it?  If you had no particular business,  now, to lead you in another direction,' urged Quilp, plucking him by  the sleeve and looking slyly up into his face out of the corners of his  eyes, 'there is a house by the water-side where they have some of the  noblest Schiedam--reputed to be smuggled, but that's between  ourselves--that can be got in all the world.
  The landlord knows me.
  There's a little summer-house overlooking the river, where we might  take a glass of this delicious liquor with a whiff of the best  tobacco--it's in this case, and of the rarest quality, to my certain  knowledge--and be perfectly snug and happy, could we possibly contrive  it; or is there any very particular engagement that peremptorily takes  you another way, Mr Swiveller, eh?'    As the dwarf spoke, Dick's face relaxed into a compliant smile, and his  brows slowly unbent.
  By the time he had finished, Dick was looking  down at Quilp in the same sly manner as Quilp was looking up at him,  and there remained nothing more to be done but to set out for the house  in question.
  This they did, straightway.
  The moment their backs were  turned, little Jacob thawed, and resumed his crying from the point  where Quilp had frozen him.
    The summer-house of which Mr Quilp had spoken was a rugged wooden box,  rotten and bare to see, which overhung the river's mud, and threatened  to slide down into it.
  The tavern to which it belonged was a crazy  building, sapped and undermined by the rats, and only upheld by great  bars of wood which were reared against its walls, and had propped it up  so long that even they were decaying and yielding with their load, and  of a windy night might be heard to creak and crack as if the whole  fabric were about to come toppling down.
  The house stood--if anything  so old and feeble could be said to stand--on a piece of waste ground,  blighted with the unwholesome smoke of factory chimneys, and echoing  the clank of iron wheels and rush of troubled water.
  Its internal  accommodations amply fulfilled the promise of the outside.
  The rooms  were low and damp, the clammy walls were pierced with chinks and holes,  the rotten floors had sunk from their level, the very beams started  from their places and warned the timid stranger from their  neighbourhood.
    To this inviting spot, entreating him to observe its beauties as they  passed along, Mr Quilp led Richard Swiveller, and on the table of the  summer-house, scored deep with many a gallows and initial letter, there  soon appeared a wooden keg, full of the vaunted liquor.
  Drawing it off  into the glasses with the skill of a practised hand, and mixing it with  about a third part of water, Mr Quilp assigned to Richard Swiveller his  portion, and lighting his pipe from an end of a candle in a very old  and battered lantern, drew himself together upon a seat and puffed away.
    'Is it good?' said Quilp, as Richard Swiveller smacked his lips, 'is it  strong and fiery?  Does it make you wink, and choke, and your eyes  water, and your breath come short--does it?'    'Does it?' cried Dick, throwing away part of the contents of his glass,  and filling it up with water, 'why, man, you don't mean to tell me that  you drink such fire as this?'    'No!' rejoined Quilp, 'Not drink it!  Look here.
  And here.
  And here  again.
  Not drink it!'    As he spoke, Daniel Quilp drew off and drank three small glassfuls of  the raw spirit, and then with a horrible grimace took a great many  pulls at his pipe, and swallowing the smoke, discharged it in a heavy  cloud from his nose.
  This feat accomplished he drew himself together  in his former position, and laughed excessively.
    'Give us a toast!' cried Quilp, rattling on the table in a dexterous  manner with his fist and elbow alternately, in a kind of tune, 'a  woman, a beauty.
  Let's have a beauty for our toast and empty our  glasses to the last drop.
  Her name, come!'    'If you want a name,' said Dick, 'here's Sophy Wackles.
'    'Sophy Wackles,' screamed the dwarf, 'Miss Sophy Wackles that is--Mrs  Richard Swiveller that shall be--that shall be--ha ha ha!'    'Ah!' said Dick, 'you might have said that a few weeks ago, but it  won't do now, my buck.
  Immolating herself upon the shrine of Cheggs--'    'Poison Cheggs, cut Cheggs's ears off,' rejoined Quilp.
  'I won't hear  of Cheggs.
  Her name is Swiveller or nothing.
  I'll drink her health  again, and her father's, and her mother's; and to all her sisters and  brothers--the glorious family of the Wackleses--all the Wackleses in  one glass--down with it to the dregs!'    'Well,' said Richard Swiveller, stopping short in the act of raising  the glass to his lips and looking at the dwarf in a species of stupor  as he flourished his arms and legs about: 'you're a jolly fellow, but  of all the jolly fellows I ever saw or heard of, you have the queerest  and most extraordinary way with you, upon my life you have.
'    This candid declaration tended rather to increase than restrain Mr  Quilp's eccentricities, and Richard Swiveller, astonished to see him in  such a roystering vein, and drinking not a little himself, for  company--began imperceptibly to become more companionable and  confiding, so that, being judiciously led on by Mr Quilp, he grew at  last very confiding indeed.
  Having once got him into this mood, and  knowing now the key-note to strike whenever he was at a loss, Daniel  Quilp's task was comparatively an easy one, and he was soon in  possession of the whole details of the scheme contrived between the  easy Dick and his more designing friend.
    'Stop!' said Quilp.
  'That's the thing, that's the thing.
  It can be  brought about, it shall be brought about.
  There's my hand upon it; I  am your friend from this minute.
'    'What! do you think there's still a chance?' inquired Dick, in surprise  at this encouragement.
    'A chance!' echoed the dwarf, 'a certainty!  Sophy Wackles may become a  Cheggs or anything else she likes, but not a Swiveller.
  Oh you lucky  dog!  He's richer than any Jew alive; you're a made man.
  I see in you  now nothing but Nelly's husband, rolling in gold and silver.
  I'll help  you.
  It shall be done.
  Mind my words, it shall be done.
'    'But how?' said Dick.
    'There's plenty of time,' rejoined the dwarf, 'and it shall be done.
  We'll sit down and talk it over again all the way through.
  Fill your  glass while I'm gone.
  I shall be back directly--directly.
'    With these hasty words, Daniel Quilp withdrew into a dismantled skittle-  ground behind the public-house, and, throwing himself upon the ground  actually screamed and rolled about in uncontrollable delight.
    'Here's sport!' he cried, 'sport ready to my hand, all invented and  arranged, and only to be enjoyed.
  It was this shallow-pated fellow who  made my bones ache t'other day, was it?  It was his friend and  fellow-plotter, Mr Trent, that once made eyes at Mrs Quilp, and leered  and looked, was it?  After labouring for two or three years in their  precious scheme, to find that they've got a beggar at last, and one of  them tied for life.
  Ha ha ha!  He shall marry Nell.
  He shall have  her, and I'll be the first man, when the knot's tied hard and fast, to  tell 'em what they've gained and what I've helped 'em to.
  Here will be  a clearing of old scores, here will be a time to remind 'em what a  capital friend I was, and how I helped them to the heiress.
  Ha ha ha!'    In the height of his ecstasy, Mr Quilp had like to have met with a  disagreeable check, for rolling very near a broken dog-kennel, there  leapt forth a large fierce dog, who, but that his chain was of the  shortest, would have given him a disagreeable salute.
  As it was, the  dwarf remained upon his back in perfect safety, taunting the dog with  hideous faces, and triumphing over him in his inability to advance  another inch, though there were not a couple of feet between them.
    'Why don't you come and bite me, why don't you come and tear me to  pieces, you coward?' said Quilp, hissing and worrying the animal till  he was nearly mad.
  'You're afraid, you bully, you're afraid, you know  you are.
'    The dog tore and strained at his chain with starting eyes and furious  bark, but there the dwarf lay, snapping his fingers with gestures of  defiance and contempt.
  When he had sufficiently recovered from his  delight, he rose, and with his arms a-kimbo, achieved a kind of  demon-dance round the kennel, just without the limits of the chain,  driving the dog quite wild.
  Having by this means composed his spirits  and put himself in a pleasant train, he returned to his unsuspicious  companion, whom he found looking at the tide with exceeding gravity,  and thinking of that same gold and silver which Mr Quilp had mentioned.
              The remainder of that day and the whole of the next were a busy time  for the Nubbles family, to whom everything connected with Kit's outfit  and departure was matter of as great moment as if he had been about to  penetrate into the interior of Africa, or to take a cruise round the  world.
  It would be difficult to suppose that there ever was a box  which was opened and shut so many times within four-and-twenty hours,  as that which contained his wardrobe and necessaries; and certainly  there never was one which to two small eyes presented such a mine of  clothing, as this mighty chest with its three shirts and proportionate  allowance of stockings and pocket-handkerchiefs, disclosed to the  astonished vision of little Jacob.
  At last it was conveyed to the  carrier's, at whose house at Finchley Kit was to find it next day; and  the box being gone, there remained but two questions for consideration:  firstly, whether the carrier would lose, or dishonestly feign to lose,  the box upon the road; secondly, whether Kit's mother perfectly  understood how to take care of herself in the absence of her son.
    'I don't think there's hardly a chance of his really losing it, but  carriers are under great temptation to pretend they lose things, no  doubt,' said Mrs Nubbles apprehensively, in reference to the first  point.
    'No doubt about it,' returned Kit, with a serious look; 'upon my word,  mother, I don't think it was right to trust it to itself.
  Somebody  ought to have gone with it, I'm afraid.
'    'We can't help it now,' said his mother; 'but it was foolish and wrong.
  People oughtn't to be tempted.
'    Kit inwardly resolved that he would never tempt a carrier any more,  save with an empty box; and having formed this Christian determination,  he turned his thoughts to the second question.
    '_You_ know you must keep up your spirits, mother, and not be lonesome  because I'm not at home.
  I shall very often be able to look in when I  come into town I dare say, and I shall send you a letter sometimes, and  when the quarter comes round, I can get a holiday of course; and then  see if we don't take little Jacob to the play, and let him know what  oysters means.
'    'I hope plays mayn't be sinful, Kit, but I'm a'most afraid,' said Mrs  Nubbles.
    'I know who has been putting that in your head,' rejoined her son  disconsolately; 'that's Little Bethel again.
  Now I say, mother, pray  don't take to going there regularly, for if I was to see your  good-humoured face that has always made home cheerful, turned into a  grievous one, and the baby trained to look grievous too, and to call  itself a young sinner (bless its heart) and a child of the devil (which  is calling its dead father names); if I was to see this, and see little  Jacob looking grievous likewise, I should so take it to heart that I'm  sure I should go and list for a soldier, and run my head on purpose  against the first cannon-ball I saw coming my way.
'    'Oh, Kit, don't talk like that.
'    'I would, indeed, mother, and unless you want to make me feel very  wretched and uncomfortable, you'll keep that bow on your bonnet, which  you'd more than half a mind to pull off last week.
  Can you suppose  there's any harm in looking as cheerful and being as cheerful as our  poor circumstances will permit?  Do I see anything in the way I'm made,  which calls upon me to be a snivelling, solemn, whispering chap,  sneaking about as if I couldn't help it, and expressing myself in a  most unpleasant snuffle?  on the contrary, don't I see every reason why  I shouldn't?  just hear this!  Ha ha ha!  An't that as nat'ral as  walking, and as good for the health?  Ha ha ha!  An't that as nat'ral  as a sheep's bleating, or a pig's grunting, or a horse's neighing, or a  bird's singing?  Ha ha ha!  Isn't it, mother?'    There was something contagious in Kit's laugh, for his mother, who had  looked grave before, first subsided into a smile, and then fell to  joining in it heartily, which occasioned Kit to say that he knew it was  natural, and to laugh the more.
  Kit and his mother, laughing together  in a pretty loud key, woke the baby, who, finding that there was  something very jovial and agreeable in progress, was no sooner in its  mother's arms than it began to kick and laugh, most vigorously.
  This  new illustration of his argument so tickled Kit, that he fell backward  in his chair in a state of exhaustion, pointing at the baby and shaking  his sides till he rocked again.
  After recovering twice or thrice, and  as often relapsing, he wiped his eyes and said grace; and a very  cheerful meal their scanty supper was.
    With more kisses, and hugs, and tears, than many young gentlemen who  start upon their travels, and leave well-stocked homes behind them,  would deem within the bounds of probability (if matter so low could be  herein set down), Kit left the house at an early hour next morning, and  set out to walk to Finchley; feeling a sufficient pride in his  appearance to have warranted his excommunication from Little Bethel  from that time forth, if he had ever been one of that mournful  congregation.
    Lest anybody should feel a curiosity to know how Kit was clad, it may  be briefly remarked that he wore no livery, but was dressed in a coat  of pepper-and-salt with waistcoat of canary colour, and nether garments  of iron-grey; besides these glories, he shone in the lustre of a new  pair of boots and an extremely stiff and shiny hat, which on being  struck anywhere with the knuckles, sounded like a drum.
  And in this  attire, rather wondering that he attracted so little attention, and  attributing the circumstance to the insensibility of those who got up  early, he made his way towards Abel Cottage.
    Without encountering any more remarkable adventure on the road, than  meeting a lad in a brimless hat, the exact counterpart of his old one,  on whom he bestowed half the sixpence he possessed, Kit arrived in  course of time at the carrier's house, where, to the lasting honour of  human nature, he found the box in safety.
  Receiving from the wife of  this immaculate man, a direction to Mr Garland's, he took the box upon  his shoulder and repaired thither directly.
    To be sure, it was a beautiful little cottage with a thatched roof and  little spires at the gable-ends, and pieces of stained glass in some of  the windows, almost as large as pocket-books.
  On one side of the house  was a little stable, just the size for the pony, with a little room  over it, just the size for Kit.
  White curtains were fluttering, and  birds in cages that looked as bright as if they were made of gold, were  singing at the windows; plants were arranged on either side of the  path, and clustered about the door; and the garden was bright with  flowers in full bloom, which shed a sweet odour all round, and had a  charming and elegant appearance.
  Everything within the house and  without, seemed to be the perfection of neatness and order.
  In the  garden there was not a weed to be seen, and to judge from some dapper  gardening-tools, a basket, and a pair of gloves which were lying in one  of the walks, old Mr Garland had been at work in it that very morning.
    Kit looked about him, and admired, and looked again, and this a great  many times before he could make up his mind to turn his head another  way and ring the bell.
  There was abundance of time to look about him  again though, when he had rung it, for nobody came, so after ringing it  twice or thrice he sat down upon his box, and waited.
    He rang the bell a great many times, and yet nobody came.
  But at last,  as he was sitting upon the box thinking about giants' castles, and  princesses tied up to pegs by the hair of their heads, and dragons  bursting out from behind gates, and other incidents of the like nature,  common in story-books to youths of low degree on their first visit to  strange houses, the door was gently opened, and a little servant-girl,  very tidy, modest, and demure, but very pretty too, appeared.
    'I suppose you're Christopher, sir,' said the servant-girl.
    Kit got off the box, and said yes, he was.
    'I'm afraid you've rung a good many times perhaps,' she rejoined, 'but  we couldn't hear you, because we've been catching the pony.
'    Kit rather wondered what this meant, but as he couldn't stop there,  asking questions, he shouldered the box again and followed the girl  into the hall, where through a back-door he descried Mr Garland leading  Whisker in triumph up the garden, after that self-willed pony had (as  he afterwards learned) dodged the family round a small paddock in the  rear, for one hour and three quarters.
    The old gentleman received him very kindly and so did the old lady,  whose previous good opinion of him was greatly enhanced by his wiping  his boots on the mat until the soles of his feet burnt again.
  He was  then taken into the parlour to be inspected in his new clothes; and  when he had been surveyed several times, and had afforded by his  appearance unlimited satisfaction, he was taken into the stable (where  the pony received him with uncommon complaisance); and thence into the  little chamber he had already observed, which was very clean and  comfortable: and thence into the garden, in which the old gentleman  told him he would be taught to employ himself, and where he told him,  besides, what great things he meant to do to make him comfortable, and  happy, if he found he deserved it.
  All these kindnesses, Kit  acknowledged with various expressions of gratitude, and so many touches  of the new hat, that the brim suffered considerably.
  When the old  gentleman had said all he had to say in the way of promise and advice,  and Kit had said all he had to say in the way of assurance and  thankfulness, he was handed over again to the old lady, who, summoning  the little servant-girl (whose name was Barbara) instructed her to take  him down stairs and give him something to eat and drink, after his walk.
    Down stairs, therefore, Kit went; and at the bottom of the stairs there  was such a kitchen as was never before seen or heard of out of a  toy-shop window, with everything in it as bright and glowing, and as  precisely ordered too, as Barbara herself.
  And in this kitchen, Kit  sat himself down at a table as white as a tablecloth, to eat cold meat,  and drink small ale, and use his knife and fork the more awkwardly,  because there was an unknown Barbara looking on and observing him.
    It did not appear, however, that there was anything remarkably  tremendous about this strange Barbara, who having lived a very quiet  life, blushed very much and was quite as embarrassed and uncertain what  she ought to say or do, as Kit could possibly be.
  When he had sat for  some little time, attentive to the ticking of the sober clock, he  ventured to glance curiously at the dresser, and there, among the  plates and dishes, were Barbara's little work-box with a sliding lid to  shut in the balls of cotton, and Barbara's prayer-book, and Barbara's  hymn-book, and Barbara's Bible.
  Barbara's little looking-glass hung in  a good light near the window, and Barbara's bonnet was on a nail behind  the door.
  From all these mute signs and tokens of her presence, he  naturally glanced at Barbara herself, who sat as mute as they, shelling  peas into a dish; and just when Kit was looking at her eyelashes and  wondering--quite in the simplicity of his heart--what colour her eyes  might be, it perversely happened that Barbara raised her head a little  to look at him, when both pair of eyes were hastily withdrawn, and Kit  leant over his plate, and Barbara over her pea-shells, each in extreme  confusion at having been detected by the other.
              Mr Richard Swiveller wending homeward from the Wilderness (for such was  the appropriate name of Quilp's choice retreat), after a sinuous and  corkscrew fashion, with many checks and stumbles; after stopping  suddenly and staring about him, then as suddenly running forward for a  few paces, and as suddenly halting again and shaking his head; doing  everything with a jerk and nothing by premeditation;--Mr Richard  Swiveller wending his way homeward after this fashion, which is  considered by evil-minded men to be symbolical of intoxication, and is  not held by such persons to denote that state of deep wisdom and  reflection in which the actor knows himself to be, began to think that  possibly he had misplaced his confidence and that the dwarf might not  be precisely the sort of person to whom to entrust a secret of such  delicacy and importance.
  And being led and tempted on by this  remorseful thought into a condition which the evil-minded class before  referred to would term the maudlin state or stage of drunkenness, it  occurred to Mr Swiveller to cast his hat upon the ground, and moan,  crying aloud that he was an unhappy orphan, and that if he had not been  an unhappy orphan things had never come to this.
    'Left an infant by my parents, at an early age,' said Mr Swiveller,  bewailing his hard lot, 'cast upon the world in my tenderest period,  and thrown upon the mercies of a deluding dwarf, who can wonder at my  weakness!  Here's a miserable orphan for you.
  Here,' said Mr Swiveller  raising his voice to a high pitch, and looking sleepily round, 'is a  miserable orphan!'    'Then,' said somebody hard by, 'let me be a father to you.
'    Mr Swiveller swayed himself to and fro to preserve his balance, and,  looking into a kind of haze which seemed to surround him, at last  perceived two eyes dimly twinkling through the mist, which he observed  after a short time were in the neighbourhood of a nose and mouth.
  Casting his eyes down towards that quarter in which, with reference to  a man's face, his legs are usually to be found, he observed that the  face had a body attached; and when he looked more intently he was  satisfied that the person was Mr Quilp, who indeed had been in his  company all the time, but whom he had some vague idea of having left a  mile or two behind.
    'You have deceived an orphan, Sir,' said Mr Swiveller solemnly.
'    'I!  I'm a second father to you,' replied Quilp.
    'You my father, Sir!' retorted Dick.
  'Being all right myself, Sir, I  request to be left alone--instantly, Sir.
'    'What a funny fellow you are!' cried Quilp.
    'Go, Sir,' returned Dick, leaning against a post and waving his hand.
  'Go, deceiver, go, some day, Sir, p'r'aps you'll waken, from pleasure's  dream to know, the grief of orphans forsaken.
  Will you go, Sir?'    The dwarf taking no heed of this adjuration, Mr Swiveller advanced with  the view of inflicting upon him condign chastisement.
  But forgetting  his purpose or changing his mind before he came close to him, he seized  his hand and vowed eternal friendship, declaring with an agreeable  frankness that from that time forth they were brothers in everything  but personal appearance.
  Then he told his secret over again, with the  addition of being pathetic on the subject of Miss Wackles, who, he gave  Mr Quilp to understand, was the occasion of any slight incoherency he  might observe in his speech at that moment, which was attributable  solely to the strength of his affection and not to rosy wine or other  fermented liquor.
  And then they went on arm-in-arm, very lovingly  together.
    'I'm as sharp,' said Quilp to him, at parting, 'as sharp as a ferret,  and as cunning as a weazel.
  You bring Trent to me; assure him that I'm  his friend though I fear he a little distrusts me (I don't know why, I  have not deserved it); and you've both of you made your fortunes--in  perspective.
'    'That's the worst of it,' returned Dick.
  'These fortunes in  perspective look such a long way off.
'    'But they look smaller than they really are, on that account,' said  Quilp, pressing his arm.
  'You'll have no conception of the value of  your prize until you draw close to it.
  Mark that.
'    'D'ye think not?' said Dick.
    'Aye, I do; and I am certain of what I say, that's better,' returned  the dwarf.
  'You bring Trent to me.
  Tell him I am his friend and  yours--why shouldn't I be?'    'There's no reason why you shouldn't, certainly,' replied Dick, 'and  perhaps there are a great many why you should--at least there would be  nothing strange in your wanting to be my friend, if you were a choice  spirit, but then you know you're not a choice spirit.
'    'I not a choice spirit?' cried Quilp.
    'Devil a bit, sir,' returned Dick.
  'A man of your appearance couldn't  be.
  If you're any spirit at all, sir, you're an evil spirit.
  Choice  spirits,' added Dick, smiting himself on the breast, 'are quite a  different looking sort of people, you may take your oath of that, sir.
'    Quilp glanced at his free-spoken friend with a mingled expression of  cunning and dislike, and wringing his hand almost at the same moment,  declared that he was an uncommon character and had his warmest esteem.
  With that they parted; Mr Swiveller to make the best of his way home  and sleep himself sober; and Quilp to cogitate upon the discovery he  had made, and exult in the prospect of the rich field of enjoyment and  reprisal it opened to him.
    It was not without great reluctance and misgiving that Mr Swiveller,  next morning, his head racked by the fumes of the renowned Schiedam,  repaired to the lodging of his friend Trent (which was in the roof of  an old house in an old ghostly inn), and recounted by very slow degrees  what had yesterday taken place between him and Quilp.
  Nor was it  without great surprise and much speculation on Quilp's probable  motives, nor without many bitter comments on Dick Swiveller's folly,  that his friend received the tale.
    'I don't defend myself, Fred,' said the penitent Richard; 'but the  fellow has such a queer way with him and is such an artful dog, that  first of all he set me upon thinking whether there was any harm in  telling him, and while I was thinking, screwed it out of me.
  If you  had seen him drink and smoke, as I did, you couldn't have kept anything  from him.
  He's a Salamander you know, that's what he is.
'    Without inquiring whether Salamanders were of necessity good  confidential agents, or whether a fire-proof man was as a matter of  course trustworthy, Frederick Trent threw himself into a chair, and,  burying his head in his hands, endeavoured to fathom the motives which  had led Quilp to insinuate himself into Richard Swiveller's  confidence;--for that the disclosure was of his seeking, and had not  been spontaneously revealed by Dick, was sufficiently plain from  Quilp's seeking his company and enticing him away.
    The dwarf had twice encountered him when he was endeavouring to obtain  intelligence of the fugitives.
  This, perhaps, as he had not shown any  previous anxiety about them, was enough to awaken suspicion in the  breast of a creature so jealous and distrustful by nature, setting  aside any additional impulse to curiosity that he might have derived  from Dick's incautious manner.
  But knowing the scheme they had  planned, why should he offer to assist it?  This was a question more  difficult of solution; but as knaves generally overreach themselves by  imputing their own designs to others, the idea immediately presented  itself that some circumstances of irritation between Quilp and the old  man, arising out of their secret transactions and not unconnected  perhaps with his sudden disappearance, now rendered the former desirous  of revenging himself upon him by seeking to entrap the sole object of  his love and anxiety into a connexion of which he knew he had a dread  and hatred.
  As Frederick Trent himself, utterly regardless of his  sister, had this object at heart, only second to the hope of gain, it  seemed to him the more likely to be Quilp's main principle of action.
  Once investing the dwarf with a design of his own in abetting them,  which the attainment of their purpose would serve, it was easy to  believe him sincere and hearty in the cause; and as there could be no  doubt of his proving a powerful and useful auxiliary, Trent determined  to accept his invitation and go to his house that night, and if what he  said and did confirmed him in the impression he had formed, to let him  share the labour of their plan, but not the profit.
    Having revolved these things in his mind and arrived at this  conclusion, he communicated to Mr Swiveller as much of his meditations  as he thought proper (Dick would have been perfectly satisfied with  less), and giving him the day to recover himself from his late  salamandering, accompanied him at evening to Mr Quilp's house.
    Mighty glad Mr Quilp was to see them, or mightily glad he seemed to be;  and fearfully polite Mr Quilp was to Mrs Quilp and Mrs Jiniwin; and  very sharp was the look he cast on his wife to observe how she was  affected by the recognition of young Trent.
  Mrs Quilp was as innocent  as her own mother of any emotion, painful or pleasant, which the sight  of him awakened, but as her husband's glance made her timid and  confused, and uncertain what to do or what was required of her, Mr  Quilp did not fail to assign her embarrassment to the cause he had in  his mind, and while he chuckled at his penetration was secretly  exasperated by his jealousy.
    Nothing of this appeared, however.
  On the contrary, Mr Quilp was all  blandness and suavity, and presided over the case-bottle of rum with  extraordinary open-heartedness.
    'Why, let me see,' said Quilp.
  'It must be a matter of nearly two  years since we were first acquainted.
'    'Nearer three, I think,' said Trent.
    'Nearer three!' cried Quilp.
  'How fast time flies.
  Does it seem as  long as that to you, Mrs Quilp?'    'Yes, I think it seems full three years, Quilp,' was the unfortunate  reply.
    'Oh indeed, ma'am,' thought Quilp, 'you have been pining, have you?  Very good, ma'am.
'    'It seems to me but yesterday that you went out to Demerara in the Mary  Anne,' said Quilp; 'but yesterday, I declare.
  Well, I like a little  wildness.
  I was wild myself once.
'    Mr Quilp accompanied this admission with such an awful wink, indicative  of old rovings and backslidings, that Mrs Jiniwin was indignant, and  could not forbear from remarking under her breath that he might at  least put off his confessions until his wife was absent; for which act  of boldness and insubordination Mr Quilp first stared her out of  countenance and then drank her health ceremoniously.
    'I thought you'd come back directly, Fred.
  I always thought that,'  said Quilp setting down his glass.
  'And when the Mary Anne returned  with you on board, instead of a letter to say what a contrite heart you  had, and how happy you were in the situation that had been provided for  you, I was amused--exceedingly amused.
  Ha ha ha!'    The young man smiled, but not as though the theme was the most  agreeable one that could have been selected for his entertainment; and  for that reason Quilp pursued it.
    'I always will say,' he resumed, 'that when a rich relation having two  young people--sisters or brothers, or brother and sister--dependent on  him, attaches himself exclusively to one, and casts off the other, he  does wrong.
'    The young man made a movement of impatience, but Quilp went on as  calmly as if he were discussing some abstract question in which nobody  present had the slightest personal interest.
    'It's very true,' said Quilp, 'that your grandfather urged repeated  forgiveness, ingratitude, riot, and extravagance, and all that; but as  I told him "these are common faults.
"  "But he's a scoundrel," said he.
  "Granting that," said I (for the sake of argument of course), "a great  many young noblemen and gentlemen are scoundrels too!" But he wouldn't  be convinced.
'    'I wonder at that, Mr Quilp,' said the young man sarcastically.
    'Well, so did I at the time,' returned Quilp, 'but he was always  obstinate.
  He was in a manner a friend of mine, but he was always  obstinate and wrong-headed.
  Little Nell is a nice girl, a charming  girl, but you're her brother, Frederick.
  You're her brother after all;  as you told him the last time you met, he can't alter that.
'    'He would if he could, confound him for that and all other kindnesses,'  said the young man impatiently.
  'But nothing can come of this subject  now, and let us have done with it in the Devil's name.
'    'Agreed,' returned Quilp, 'agreed on my part readily.
  Why have I  alluded to it?  Just to show you, Frederick, that I have always stood  your friend.
  You little knew who was your friend, and who your foe;  now did you?  You thought I was against you, and so there has been a  coolness between us; but it was all on your side, entirely on your  side.
  Let's shake hands again, Fred.
'    With his head sunk down between his shoulders, and a hideous grin  over-spreading his face, the dwarf stood up and stretched his short arm  across the table.
  After a moment's hesitation, the young man stretched  out his to meet it; Quilp clutched his fingers in a grip that for the  moment stopped the current of the blood within them, and pressing his  other hand upon his lip and frowning towards the unsuspicious Richard,  released them and sat down.
    This action was not lost upon Trent, who, knowing that Richard  Swiveller was a mere tool in his hands and knew no more of his designs  than he thought proper to communicate, saw that the dwarf perfectly  understood their relative position, and fully entered into the  character of his friend.
  It is something to be appreciated, even in  knavery.
  This silent homage to his superior abilities, no less than a  sense of the power with which the dwarf's quick perception had already  invested him, inclined the young man towards that ugly worthy, and  determined him to profit by his aid.
    It being now Mr Quilp's cue to change the subject with all convenient  expedition, lest Richard Swiveller in his heedlessness should reveal  anything which it was inexpedient for the women to know, he proposed a  game at four-handed cribbage, and partners being cut for, Mrs Quilp  fell to Frederick Trent, and Dick himself to Quilp.
  Mrs Jiniwin being  very fond of cards was carefully excluded by her son-in-law from any  participation in the game, and had assigned to her the duty of  occasionally replenishing the glasses from the case-bottle; Mr Quilp  from that moment keeping one eye constantly upon her, lest she should  by any means procure a taste of the same, and thereby tantalising the  wretched old lady (who was as much attached to the case-bottle as the  cards) in a double degree and most ingenious manner.
    But it was not to Mrs Jiniwin alone that Mr Quilp's attention was  restricted, as several other matters required his constant vigilance.
  Among his various eccentric habits he had a humorous one of always  cheating at cards, which rendered necessary on his part, not only a  close observance of the game, and a sleight-of-hand in counting and  scoring, but also involved the constant correction, by looks, and  frowns, and kicks under the table, of Richard Swiveller, who being  bewildered by the rapidity with which his cards were told, and the rate  at which the pegs travelled down the board, could not be prevented from  sometimes expressing his surprise and incredulity.
  Mrs Quilp too was  the partner of young Trent, and for every look that passed between  them, and every word they spoke, and every card they played, the dwarf  had eyes and ears; not occupied alone with what was passing above the  table, but with signals that might be exchanging beneath it, which he  laid all kinds of traps to detect; besides often treading on his wife's  toes to see whether she cried out or remained silent under the  infliction, in which latter case it would have been quite clear that  Trent had been treading on her toes before.
  Yet, in the most of all  these distractions, the one eye was upon the old lady always, and if  she so much as stealthily advanced a tea-spoon towards a neighbouring  glass (which she often did), for the purpose of abstracting but one sup  of its sweet contents, Quilp's hand would overset it in the very moment  of her triumph, and Quilp's mocking voice implore her to regard her  precious health.
  And in any one of these his many cares, from first to  last, Quilp never flagged nor faltered.
    At length, when they had played a great many rubbers and drawn pretty  freely upon the case-bottle, Mr Quilp warned his lady to retire to  rest, and that submissive wife complying, and being followed by her  indignant mother, Mr Swiveller fell asleep.
  The dwarf beckoning his  remaining companion to the other end of the room, held a short  conference with him in whispers.
    'It's as well not to say more than one can help before our worthy  friend,' said Quilp, making a grimace towards the slumbering Dick.
  'Is  it a bargain between us, Fred?  Shall he marry little rosy Nell  by-and-by?'    'You have some end of your own to answer, of course,' returned the  other.
    'Of course I have, dear Fred,' said Quilp, grinning to think how little  he suspected what the real end was.
  'It's retaliation perhaps; perhaps  whim.
  I have influence, Fred, to help or oppose.
  Which way shall I  use it?  There are a pair of scales, and it goes into one.
'    'Throw it into mine then,' said Trent.
    'It's done, Fred,' rejoined Quilp, stretching out his clenched hand and  opening it as if he had let some weight fall out.
  'It's in the scale  from this time, and turns it, Fred.
  Mind that.
'    'Where have they gone?' asked Trent.
    Quilp shook his head, and said that point remained to be discovered,  which it might be, easily.
  When it was, they would begin their  preliminary advances.
  He would visit the old man, or even Richard  Swiveller might visit him, and by affecting a deep concern in his  behalf, and imploring him to settle in some worthy home, lead to the  child's remembering him with gratitude and favour.
  Once impressed to  this extent, it would be easy, he said, to win her in a year or two,  for she supposed the old man to be poor, as it was a part of his  jealous policy (in common with many other misers) to feign to be so, to  those about him.
    'He has feigned it often enough to me, of late,' said Trent.
    'Oh! and to me too!' replied the dwarf.
  'Which is more extraordinary,  as I know how rich he really is.
'    'I suppose you should,' said Trent.
    'I think I should indeed,' rejoined the dwarf; and in that, at least,  he spoke the truth.
    After a few more whispered words, they returned to the table, and the  young man rousing Richard Swiveller informed him that he was waiting to  depart.
  This was welcome news to Dick, who started up directly.
  After  a few words of confidence in the result of their project had been  exchanged, they bade the grinning Quilp good night.
    Quilp crept to the window as they passed in the street below, and  listened.
  Trent was pronouncing an encomium upon his wife, and they  were both wondering by what enchantment she had been brought to marry  such a misshapen wretch as he.
  The dwarf after watching their  retreating shadows with a wider grin than his face had yet displayed,  stole softly in the dark to bed.
    In this hatching of their scheme, neither Trent nor Quilp had had one  thought about the happiness or misery of poor innocent Nell.
  It would  have been strange if the careless profligate, who was the butt of both,  had been harassed by any such consideration; for his high opinion of  his own merits and deserts rendered the project rather a laudable one  than otherwise; and if he had been visited by so unwonted a guest as  reflection, he would--being a brute only in the gratification of his  appetites--have soothed his conscience with the plea that he did not  mean to beat or kill his wife, and would therefore, after all said and  done, be a very tolerable, average husband.
              It was not until they were quite exhausted and could no longer maintain  the pace at which they had fled from the race-ground, that the old man  and the child ventured to stop, and sit down to rest upon the borders  of a little wood.
  Here, though the course was hidden from their view,  they could yet faintly distinguish the noise of distant shouts, the hum  of voices, and the beating of drums.
  Climbing the eminence which lay  between them and the spot they had left, the child could even discern  the fluttering flags and white tops of booths; but no person was  approaching towards them, and their resting-place was solitary and  still.
    Some time elapsed before she could reassure her trembling companion, or  restore him to a state of moderate tranquillity.
  His disordered  imagination represented to him a crowd of persons stealing towards them  beneath the cover of the bushes, lurking in every ditch, and peeping  from the boughs of every rustling tree.
  He was haunted by  apprehensions of being led captive to some gloomy place where he would  be chained and scourged, and worse than all, where Nell could never  come to see him, save through iron bars and gratings in the wall.
  His  terrors affected the child.
  Separation from her grandfather was the  greatest evil she could dread; and feeling for the time as though, go  where they would, they were to be hunted down, and could never be safe  but in hiding, her heart failed her, and her courage drooped.
    In one so young, and so unused to the scenes in which she had lately  moved, this sinking of the spirit was not surprising.
  But, Nature  often enshrines gallant and noble hearts in weak bosoms--oftenest, God  bless her, in female breasts--and when the child, casting her tearful  eyes upon the old man, remembered how weak he was, and how destitute  and helpless he would be if she failed him, her heart swelled within  her, and animated her with new strength and fortitude.
    'We are quite safe now, and have nothing to fear indeed, dear  grandfather,' she said.
    'Nothing to fear!' returned the old man.
  'Nothing to fear if they took  me from thee!  Nothing to fear if they parted us!  Nobody is true to  me.
  No, not one.
  Not even Nell!'    'Oh! do not say that,' replied the child, 'for if ever anybody was true  at heart, and earnest, I am.
  I am sure you know I am.
'    'Then how,' said the old man, looking fearfully round, 'how can you  bear to think that we are safe, when they are searching for me  everywhere, and may come here, and steal upon us, even while we're  talking?'    'Because I'm sure we have not been followed,' said the child.
  'Judge  for yourself, dear grandfather: look round, and see how quiet and still  it is.
  We are alone together, and may ramble where we like.
  Not safe!  Could I feel easy--did I feel at ease--when any danger threatened you?'    'True, too,' he answered, pressing her hand, but still looking  anxiously about.
  'What noise was that?'    'A bird,' said the child, 'flying into the wood, and leading the way  for us to follow.
'  You remember that we said we would walk in woods  and fields, and by the side of rivers, and how happy we would be--you  remember that?  But here, while the sun shines above our heads, and  everything is bright and happy, we are sitting sadly down, and losing  time.
  See what a pleasant path; and there's the bird--the same  bird--now he flies to another tree, and stays to sing.
  Come!'    When they rose up from the ground, and took the shady track which led  them through the wood, she bounded on before, printing her tiny  footsteps in the moss, which rose elastic from so light a pressure and  gave it back as mirrors throw off breath; and thus she lured the old  man on, with many a backward look and merry beck, now pointing  stealthily to some lone bird as it perched and twittered on a branch  that strayed across their path, now stopping to listen to the songs  that broke the happy silence, or watch the sun as it trembled through  the leaves, and stealing in among the ivied trunks of stout old trees,  opened long paths of light.
  As they passed onward, parting the boughs  that clustered in their way, the serenity which the child had first  assumed, stole into her breast in earnest; the old man cast no longer  fearful looks behind, but felt at ease and cheerful, for the further  they passed into the deep green shade, the more they felt that the  tranquil mind of God was there, and shed its peace on them.
    At length the path becoming clearer and less intricate, brought them to  the end of the wood, and into a public road.
  Taking their way along it  for a short distance, they came to a lane, so shaded by the trees on  either hand that they met together over-head, and arched the narrow  way.
  A broken finger-post announced that this led to a village three  miles off; and thither they resolved to bend their steps.
    The miles appeared so long that they sometimes thought they must have  missed their road.
  But at last, to their great joy, it led downwards  in a steep descent, with overhanging banks over which the footpaths  led; and the clustered houses of the village peeped from the woody  hollow below.
    It was a very small place.
  The men and boys were playing at cricket on  the green; and as the other folks were looking on, they wandered up and  down, uncertain where to seek a humble lodging.
  There was but one old  man in the little garden before his cottage, and him they were timid of  approaching, for he was the schoolmaster, and had 'School' written up  over his window in black letters on a white board.
  He was a pale,  simple-looking man, of a spare and meagre habit, and sat among his  flowers and beehives, smoking his pipe, in the little porch before his  door.
    'Speak to him, dear,' the old man whispered.
    'I am almost afraid to disturb him,' said the child timidly.
  'He does  not seem to see us.
  Perhaps if we wait a little, he may look this way.
'    They waited, but the schoolmaster cast no look towards them, and still  sat, thoughtful and silent, in the little porch.
  He had a kind face.
  In his plain old suit of black, he looked pale and meagre.
  They  fancied, too, a lonely air about him and his house, but perhaps that  was because the other people formed a merry company upon the green, and  he seemed the only solitary man in all the place.
    They were very tired, and the child would have been bold enough to  address even a schoolmaster, but for something in his manner which  seemed to denote that he was uneasy or distressed.
  As they stood  hesitating at a little distance, they saw that he sat for a few minutes  at a time like one in a brown study, then laid aside his pipe and took  a few turns in his garden, then approached the gate and looked towards  the green, then took up his pipe again with a sigh, and sat down  thoughtfully as before.
    As nobody else appeared and it would soon be dark, Nell at length took  courage, and when he had resumed his pipe and seat, ventured to draw  near, leading her grandfather by the hand.
  The slight noise they made  in raising the latch of the wicket-gate, caught his attention.
  He  looked at them kindly but seemed disappointed too, and slightly shook  his head.
    Nell dropped a curtsey, and told him they were poor travellers who  sought a shelter for the night which they would gladly pay for, so far  as their means allowed.
  The schoolmaster looked earnestly at her as  she spoke, laid aside his pipe, and rose up directly.
    'If you could direct us anywhere, sir,' said the child, 'we should take  it very kindly.
'    'You have been walking a long way,' said the schoolmaster.
    'A long way, Sir,' the child replied.
    'You're a young traveller, my child,' he said, laying his hand gently  on her head.
  'Your grandchild, friend?'    'Aye, Sir,' cried the old man, 'and the stay and comfort of my life.
'    'Come in,' said the schoolmaster.
    Without further preface he conducted them into his little school-room,  which was parlour and kitchen likewise, and told them that they were  welcome to remain under his roof till morning.
  Before they had done  thanking him, he spread a coarse white cloth upon the table, with  knives and platters; and bringing out some bread and cold meat and a  jug of beer, besought them to eat and drink.
    The child looked round the room as she took her seat.
  There were a  couple of forms, notched and cut and inked all over; a small deal desk  perched on four legs, at which no doubt the master sat; a few  dog's-eared books upon a high shelf; and beside them a motley  collection of peg-tops, balls, kites, fishing-lines, marbles,  half-eaten apples, and other confiscated property of idle urchins.
  Displayed on hooks upon the wall in all their terrors, were the cane  and ruler; and near them, on a small shelf of its own, the dunce's cap,  made of old newspapers and decorated with glaring wafers of the largest  size.
  But, the great ornaments of the walls were certain moral  sentences fairly copied in good round text, and well-worked sums in  simple addition and multiplication, evidently achieved by the same  hand, which were plentifully pasted all round the room: for the double  purpose, as it seemed, of bearing testimony to the excellence of the  school, and kindling a worthy emulation in the bosoms of the scholars.
    'Yes,' said the old schoolmaster, observing that her attention was  caught by these latter specimens.
  'That's beautiful writing, my dear.
'    'Very, Sir,' replied the child modestly, 'is it yours?'    'Mine!' he returned, taking out his spectacles and putting them on, to  have a better view of the triumphs so dear to his heart.
  'I couldn't  write like that, now-a-days.
  No.
  They're all done by one hand; a  little hand it is, not so old as yours, but a very clever one.
'    As the schoolmaster said this, he saw that a small blot of ink had been  thrown on one of the copies, so he took a penknife from his pocket, and  going up to the wall, carefully scraped it out.
  When he had finished,  he walked slowly backward from the writing, admiring it as one might  contemplate a beautiful picture, but with something of sadness in his  voice and manner which quite touched the child, though she was  unacquainted with its cause.
    'A little hand indeed,' said the poor schoolmaster.
  'Far beyond all  his companions, in his learning and his sports too, how did he ever  come to be so fond of me!  That I should love him is no wonder, but  that he should love me--' and there the schoolmaster stopped, and took  off his spectacles to wipe them, as though they had grown dim.
    'I hope there is nothing the matter, sir,' said Nell anxiously.
    'Not much, my dear,' returned the schoolmaster.
  'I hoped to have seen  him on the green to-night.
  He was always foremost among them.
  But  he'll be there to-morrow.
'    'Has he been ill?' asked the child, with a child's quick sympathy.
    'Not very.
  They said he was wandering in his head yesterday, dear boy,  and so they said the day before.
  But that's a part of that kind of  disorder; it's not a bad sign--not at all a bad sign.
'    The child was silent.
  He walked to the door, and looked wistfully out.
  The shadows of night were gathering, and all was still.
    'If he could lean upon anybody's arm, he would come to me, I know,' he  said, returning into the room.
  'He always came into the garden to say  good night.
  But perhaps his illness has only just taken a favourable  turn, and it's too late for him to come out, for it's very damp and  there's a heavy dew.
  It's much better he shouldn't come to-night.
'    The schoolmaster lighted a candle, fastened the window-shutter, and  closed the door.
  But after he had done this, and sat silent a little  time, he took down his hat, and said he would go and satisfy himself,  if Nell would sit up till he returned.
  The child readily complied, and  he went out.
    She sat there half-an-hour or more, feeling the place very strange and  lonely, for she had prevailed upon the old man to go to bed, and there  was nothing to be heard but the ticking of an old clock, and the  whistling of the wind among the trees.
  When he returned, he took his  seat in the chimney corner, but remained silent for a long time.
  At  length he turned to her, and speaking very gently, hoped she would say  a prayer that night for a sick child.
    'My favourite scholar!' said the poor schoolmaster, smoking a pipe he  had forgotten to light, and looking mournfully round upon the walls.
  'It is a little hand to have done all that, and waste away with  sickness.
  It is a very, very little hand!'              After a sound night's rest in a chamber in the thatched roof, in which  it seemed the sexton had for some years been a lodger, but which he had  lately deserted for a wife and a cottage of his own, the child rose  early in the morning and descended to the room where she had supped  last night.
  As the schoolmaster had already left his bed and gone out,  she bestirred herself to make it neat and comfortable, and had just  finished its arrangement when the kind host returned.
    He thanked her many times, and said that the old dame who usually did  such offices for him had gone to nurse the little scholar whom he had  told her of.
  The child asked how he was, and hoped he was better.
    'No,' rejoined the schoolmaster shaking his head sorrowfully, 'no  better.
  They even say he is worse.
'    'I am very sorry for that, Sir,' said the child.
    The poor schoolmaster appeared to be gratified by her earnest manner,  but yet rendered more uneasy by it, for he added hastily that anxious  people often magnified an evil and thought it greater than it was; 'for  my part,' he said, in his quiet, patient way, 'I hope it's not so.
  I  don't think he can be worse.
'    The child asked his leave to prepare breakfast, and her grandfather  coming down stairs, they all three partook of it together.
  While the  meal was in progress, their host remarked that the old man seemed much  fatigued, and evidently stood in need of rest.
    'If the journey you have before you is a long one,' he said, 'and don't  press you for one day, you're very welcome to pass another night here.
  I should really be glad if you would, friend.
'    He saw that the old man looked at Nell, uncertain whether to accept or  decline his offer; and added,    'I shall be glad to have your young companion with me for one day.
  If  you can do a charity to a lone man, and rest yourself at the same time,  do so.
  If you must proceed upon your journey, I wish you well through  it, and will walk a little way with you before school begins.
'    'What are we to do, Nell?' said the old man irresolutely, 'say what  we're to do, dear.
'    It required no great persuasion to induce the child to answer that they  had better accept the invitation and remain.
  She was happy to show her  gratitude to the kind schoolmaster by busying herself in the  performance of such household duties as his little cottage stood in  need of.
  When these were done, she took some needle-work from her  basket, and sat herself down upon a stool beside the lattice, where the  honeysuckle and woodbine entwined their tender stems, and stealing into  the room filled it with their delicious breath.
  Her grandfather was  basking in the sun outside, breathing the perfume of the flowers, and  idly watching the clouds as they floated on before the light summer  wind.
    As the schoolmaster, after arranging the two forms in due order, took  his seat behind his desk and made other preparations for school, the  child was apprehensive that she might be in the way, and offered to  withdraw to her little bedroom.
  But this he would not allow, and as he  seemed pleased to have her there, she remained, busying herself with  her work.
    'Have you many scholars, sir?' she asked.
    The poor schoolmaster shook his head, and said that they barely filled  the two forms.
    'Are the others clever, sir?' asked the child, glancing at the trophies  on the wall.
    'Good boys,' returned the schoolmaster, 'good boys enough, my dear, but  they'll never do like that.
'    A small white-headed boy with a sunburnt face appeared at the door  while he was speaking, and stopping there to make a rustic bow, came in  and took his seat upon one of the forms.
  The white-headed boy then put  an open book, astonishingly dog's-eared upon his knees, and thrusting  his hands into his pockets began counting the marbles with which they  were filled; displaying in the expression of his face a remarkable  capacity of totally abstracting his mind from the spelling on which his  eyes were fixed.
  Soon afterwards another white-headed little boy came  straggling in, and after him a red-headed lad, and after him two more  with white heads, and then one with a flaxen poll, and so on until the  forms were occupied by a dozen boys or thereabouts, with heads of every  colour but grey, and ranging in their ages from four years old to  fourteen years or more; for the legs of the youngest were a long way  from the floor when he sat upon the form, and the eldest was a heavy  good-tempered foolish fellow, about half a head taller than the  schoolmaster.
    At the top of the first form--the post of honour in the school--was the  vacant place of the little sick scholar, and at the head of the row of  pegs on which those who came in hats or caps were wont to hang them up,  one was left empty.
  No boy attempted to violate the sanctity of seat  or peg, but many a one looked from the empty spaces to the  schoolmaster, and whispered his idle neighbour behind his hand.
    Then began the hum of conning over lessons and getting them by heart,  the whispered jest and stealthy game, and all the noise and drawl of  school; and in the midst of the din sat the poor schoolmaster, the very  image of meekness and simplicity, vainly attempting to fix his mind  upon the duties of the day, and to forget his little friend.
  But the  tedium of his office reminded him more strongly of the willing scholar,  and his thoughts were rambling from his pupils--it was plain.
    None knew this better than the idlest boys, who, growing bolder with  impunity, waxed louder and more daring; playing odd-or-even under the  master's eye, eating apples openly and without rebuke, pinching each  other in sport or malice without the least reserve, and cutting their  autographs in the very legs of his desk.
  The puzzled dunce, who stood  beside it to say his lesson out of book, looked no longer at the  ceiling for forgotten words, but drew closer to the master's elbow and  boldly cast his eye upon the page; the wag of the little troop squinted  and made grimaces (at the smallest boy of course), holding no book  before his face, and his approving audience knew no constraint in their  delight.
  If the master did chance to rouse himself and seem alive to  what was going on, the noise subsided for a moment and no eyes met his  but wore a studious and a deeply humble look; but the instant he  relapsed again, it broke out afresh, and ten times louder than before.
    Oh! how some of those idle fellows longed to be outside, and how they  looked at the open door and window, as if they half meditated rushing  violently out, plunging into the woods, and being wild boys and savages  from that time forth.
  What rebellious thoughts of the cool river, and  some shady bathing-place beneath willow trees with branches dipping in  the water, kept tempting and urging that sturdy boy, who, with his  shirt-collar unbuttoned and flung back as far as it could go, sat  fanning his flushed face with a spelling-book, wishing himself a whale,  or a tittlebat, or a fly, or anything but a boy at school on that hot,  broiling day!  Heat!  ask that other boy, whose seat being nearest to  the door gave him opportunities of gliding out into the garden and  driving his companions to madness by dipping his face into the bucket  of the well and then rolling on the grass--ask him if there were ever  such a day as that, when even the bees were diving deep down into the  cups of flowers and stopping there, as if they had made up their minds  to retire from business and be manufacturers of honey no more.
  The day  was made for laziness, and lying on one's back in green places, and  staring at the sky till its brightness forced one to shut one's eyes  and go to sleep; and was this a time to be poring over musty books in a  dark room, slighted by the very sun itself?  Monstrous!    Nell sat by the window occupied with her work, but attentive still to  all that passed, though sometimes rather timid of the boisterous boys.
  The lessons over, writing time began; and there being but one desk and  that the master's, each boy sat at it in turn and laboured at his  crooked copy, while the master walked about.
  This was a quieter time;  for he would come and look over the writer's shoulder, and tell him  mildly to observe how such a letter was turned in such a copy on the  wall, praise such an up-stroke here and such a down-stroke there, and  bid him take it for his model.
  Then he would stop and tell them what  the sick child had said last night, and how he had longed to be among  them once again; and such was the poor schoolmaster's gentle and  affectionate manner, that the boys seemed quite remorseful that they  had worried him so much, and were absolutely quiet; eating no apples,  cutting no names, inflicting no pinches, and making no grimaces, for  full two minutes afterwards.
    'I think, boys,' said the schoolmaster when the clock struck twelve,  'that I shall give an extra half-holiday this afternoon.
'    At this intelligence, the boys, led on and headed by the tall boy,  raised a great shout, in the midst of which the master was seen to  speak, but could not be heard.
  As he held up his hand, however, in  token of his wish that they should be silent, they were considerate  enough to leave off, as soon as the longest-winded among them were  quite out of breath.
    'You must promise me first,' said the schoolmaster, 'that you'll not be  noisy, or at least, if you are, that you'll go away and be so--away out  of the village I mean.
  I'm sure you wouldn't disturb your old playmate  and companion.
'    There was a general murmur (and perhaps a very sincere one, for they  were but boys) in the negative; and the tall boy, perhaps as sincerely  as any of them, called those about him to witness that he had only  shouted in a whisper.
    'Then pray don't forget, there's my dear scholars,' said the  schoolmaster, 'what I have asked you, and do it as a favour to me.
  Be  as happy as you can, and don't be unmindful that you are blessed with  health.
  Good-bye all!'    'Thank'ee, Sir,' and 'good-bye, Sir,' were said a good many times in a  variety of voices, and the boys went out very slowly and softly.
  But  there was the sun shining and there were the birds singing, as the sun  only shines and the birds only sing on holidays and half-holidays;  there were the trees waving to all free boys to climb and nestle among  their leafy branches; the hay, entreating them to come and scatter it  to the pure air; the green corn, gently beckoning towards wood and  stream; the smooth ground, rendered smoother still by blending lights  and shadows, inviting to runs and leaps, and long walks God knows  whither.
  It was more than boy could bear, and with a joyous whoop the  whole cluster took to their heels and spread themselves about, shouting  and laughing as they went.
    'It's natural, thank Heaven!' said the poor schoolmaster, looking after  them.
  'I'm very glad they didn't mind me!'    It is difficult, however, to please everybody, as most of us would have  discovered, even without the fable which bears that moral, and in the  course of the afternoon several mothers and aunts of pupils looked in  to express their entire disapproval of the schoolmaster's proceeding.
  A few confined themselves to hints, such as politely inquiring what  red-letter day or saint's day the almanack said it was; a few (these  were the profound village politicians) argued that it was a slight to  the throne and an affront to church and state, and savoured of  revolutionary principles, to grant a half-holiday upon any lighter  occasion than the birthday of the Monarch; but the majority expressed  their displeasure on private grounds and in plain terms, arguing that  to put the pupils on this short allowance of learning was nothing but  an act of downright robbery and fraud: and one old lady, finding that  she could not inflame or irritate the peaceable schoolmaster by talking  to him, bounced out of his house and talked at him for half-an-hour  outside his own window, to another old lady, saying that of course he  would deduct this half-holiday from his weekly charge, or of course he  would naturally expect to have an opposition started against him; there  was no want of idle chaps in that neighbourhood (here the old lady  raised her voice), and some chaps who were too idle even to be  schoolmasters, might soon find that there were other chaps put over  their heads, and so she would have them take care, and look pretty  sharp about them.
  But all these taunts and vexations failed to elicit  one word from the meek schoolmaster, who sat with the child by his  side--a little more dejected perhaps, but quite silent and  uncomplaining.
    Towards night an old woman came tottering up the garden as speedily as  she could, and meeting the schoolmaster at the door, said he was to go  to Dame West's directly, and had best run on before her.
  He and the  child were on the point of going out together for a walk, and without  relinquishing her hand, the schoolmaster hurried away, leaving the  messenger to follow as she might.
    They stopped at a cottage-door, and the schoolmaster knocked softly at  it with his hand.
  It was opened without loss of time.
  They entered a  room where a little group of women were gathered about one, older than  the rest, who was crying very bitterly, and sat wringing her hands and  rocking herself to and fro.
    'Oh, dame!' said the schoolmaster, drawing near her chair, 'is it so  bad as this?'    'He's going fast,' cried the old woman; 'my grandson's dying.
  It's all  along of you.
  You shouldn't see him now, but for his being so earnest  on it.
  This is what his learning has brought him to.
  Oh dear, dear,  dear, what can I do!'    'Do not say that I am in any fault,' urged the gentle school-master.
  'I am not hurt, dame.
  No, no.
  You are in great distress of mind, and  don't mean what you say.
  I am sure you don't.
'    'I do,' returned the old woman.
  'I mean it all.
  If he hadn't been  poring over his books out of fear of you, he would have been well and  merry now, I know he would.
'    The schoolmaster looked round upon the other women as if to entreat  some one among them to say a kind word for him, but they shook their  heads, and murmured to each other that they never thought there was  much good in learning, and that this convinced them.
  Without saying a  word in reply, or giving them a look of reproach, he followed the old  woman who had summoned him (and who had now rejoined them) into another  room, where his infant friend, half-dressed, lay stretched upon a bed.
    He was a very young boy; quite a little child.
  His hair still hung in  curls about his face, and his eyes were very bright; but their light  was of Heaven, not earth.
  The schoolmaster took a seat beside him, and  stooping over the pillow, whispered his name.
  The boy sprung up,  stroked his face with his hand, and threw his wasted arms round his  neck, crying out that he was his dear kind friend.
    'I hope I always was.
  I meant to be, God knows,' said the poor  schoolmaster.
    'Who is that?' said the boy, seeing Nell.
  'I am afraid to kiss her,  lest I should make her ill.
  Ask her to shake hands with me.
'    The sobbing child came closer up, and took the little languid hand in  hers.
 Releasing his again after a time, the sick boy laid him gently  down.
    'You remember the garden, Harry,' whispered the schoolmaster, anxious  to rouse him, for a dulness seemed gathering upon the child, 'and how  pleasant it used to be in the evening time?  You must make haste to  visit it again, for I think the very flowers have missed you, and are  less gay than they used to be.
  You will come soon, my dear, very soon  now--won't you?'    The boy smiled faintly--so very, very faintly--and put his hand upon  his friend's grey head.
  He moved his lips too, but no voice came from  them; no, not a sound.
    In the silence that ensued, the hum of distant voices borne upon the  evening air came floating through the open window.
  'What's that?' said  the sick child, opening his eyes.
    'The boys at play upon the green.
'    He took a handkerchief from his pillow, and tried to wave it above his  head.
  But the feeble arm dropped powerless down.
    'Shall I do it?' said the schoolmaster.
    'Please wave it at the window,' was the faint reply.
  'Tie it to the  lattice.
  Some of them may see it there.
  Perhaps they'll think of me,  and look this way.
'    He raised his head, and glanced from the fluttering signal to his idle  bat, that lay with slate and book and other boyish property upon a  table in the room.
  And then he laid him softly down once more, and  asked if the little girl were there, for he could not see her.
    She stepped forward, and pressed the passive hand that lay upon the  coverlet.
  The two old friends and companions--for such they were,  though they were man and child--held each other in a long embrace, and  then the little scholar turned his face towards the wall, and fell  asleep.
    The poor schoolmaster sat in the same place, holding the small cold  hand in his, and chafing it.
  It was but the hand of a dead child.
  He  felt that; and yet he chafed it still, and could not lay it down.
              Almost broken-hearted, Nell withdrew with the schoolmaster from the  bedside and returned to his cottage.
  In the midst of her grief and  tears she was yet careful to conceal their real cause from the old man,  for the dead boy had been a grandchild, and left but one aged relative  to mourn his premature decay.
    She stole away to bed as quickly as she could, and when she was alone,  gave free vent to the sorrow with which her breast was overcharged.
  But the sad scene she had witnessed, was not without its lesson of  content and gratitude; of content with the lot which left her health  and freedom; and gratitude that she was spared to the one relative and  friend she loved, and to live and move in a beautiful world, when so  many young creatures--as young and full of hope as she--were stricken  down and gathered to their graves.
  How many of the mounds in that old  churchyard where she had lately strayed, grew green above the graves of  children!  And though she thought as a child herself, and did not  perhaps sufficiently consider to what a bright and happy existence  those who die young are borne, and how in death they lose the pain of  seeing others die around them, bearing to the tomb some strong  affection of their hearts (which makes the old die many times in one  long life), still she thought wisely enough, to draw a plain and easy  moral from what she had seen that night, and to store it, deep in her  mind.
    Her dreams were of the little scholar: not coffined and covered up, but  mingling with angels, and smiling happily.
  The sun darting his  cheerful rays into the room, awoke her; and now there remained but to  take leave of the poor schoolmaster and wander forth once more.
    By the time they were ready to depart, school had begun.
  In the  darkened room, the din of yesterday was going on again: a little  sobered and softened down, perhaps, but only a very little, if at all.
  The schoolmaster rose from his desk and walked with them to the gate.
    It was with a trembling and reluctant hand, that the child held out to  him the money which the lady had given her at the races for her  flowers: faltering in her thanks as she thought how small the sum was,  and blushing as she offered it.
  But he bade her put it up, and  stooping to kiss her cheek, turned back into his house.
    They had not gone half-a-dozen paces when he was at the door again; the  old man retraced his steps to shake hands, and the child did the same.
    'Good fortune and happiness go with you!' said the poor schoolmaster.
  'I am quite a solitary man now.
  If you ever pass this way again,  you'll not forget the little village-school.
'    'We shall never forget it, sir,' rejoined Nell; 'nor ever forget to be  grateful to you for your kindness to us.
'    'I have heard such words from the lips of children very often,' said  the schoolmaster, shaking his head, and smiling thoughtfully, 'but they  were soon forgotten.
  I had attached one young friend to me, the better  friend for being young--but that's over--God bless you!'    They bade him farewell very many times, and turned away, walking slowly  and often looking back, until they could see him no more.
  At length  they had left the village far behind, and even lost sight of the smoke  among the trees.
  They trudged onward now, at a quicker pace, resolving  to keep the main road, and go wherever it might lead them.
    But main roads stretch a long, long way.
  With the exception of two or  three inconsiderable clusters of cottages which they passed, without  stopping, and one lonely road-side public-house where they had some  bread and cheese, this highway had led them to nothing--late in the  afternoon--and still lengthened out, far in the distance, the same  dull, tedious, winding course, that they had been pursuing all day.
  As  they had no resource, however, but to go forward, they still kept on,  though at a much slower pace, being very weary and fatigued.
    The afternoon had worn away into a beautiful evening, when they arrived  at a point where the road made a sharp turn and struck across a common.
  On the border of this common, and close to the hedge which divided it  from the cultivated fields, a caravan was drawn up to rest; upon which,  by reason of its situation, they came so suddenly that they could not  have avoided it if they would.
    It was not a shabby, dingy, dusty cart, but a smart little house upon  wheels, with white dimity curtains festooning the windows, and  window-shutters of green picked out with panels of a staring red, in  which happily-contrasted colours the whole concern shone brilliant.
  Neither was it a poor caravan drawn by a single donkey or emaciated  horse, for a pair of horses in pretty good condition were released from  the shafts and grazing on the frouzy grass.
  Neither was it a gipsy  caravan, for at the open door (graced with a bright brass knocker) sat  a Christian lady, stout and comfortable to look upon, who wore a large  bonnet trembling with bows.
  And that it was not an unprovided or  destitute caravan was clear from this lady's occupation, which was the  very pleasant and refreshing one of taking tea.
  The tea-things,  including a bottle of rather suspicious character and a cold knuckle of  ham, were set forth upon a drum, covered with a white napkin; and  there, as if at the most convenient round-table in all the world, sat  this roving lady, taking her tea and enjoying the prospect.
    It happened that at that moment the lady of the caravan had her cup  (which, that everything about her might be of a stout and comfortable  kind, was a breakfast cup) to her lips, and that having her eyes lifted  to the sky in her enjoyment of the full flavour of the tea, not  unmingled possibly with just the slightest dash or gleam of something  out of the suspicious bottle--but this is mere speculation and not  distinct matter of history--it happened that being thus agreeably  engaged, she did not see the travellers when they first came up.
  It  was not until she was in the act of getting down the cup, and drawing a  long breath after the exertion of causing its contents to disappear,  that the lady of the caravan beheld an old man and a young child  walking slowly by, and glancing at her proceedings with eyes of modest  but hungry admiration.
    'Hey!' cried the lady of the caravan, scooping the crumbs out of her  lap and swallowing the same before wiping her lips.
  'Yes, to be  sure--Who won the Helter-Skelter Plate, child?'    'Won what, ma'am?' asked Nell.
    'The Helter-Skelter Plate at the races, child--the plate that was run  for on the second day.
'    'On the second day, ma'am?'    'Second day!  Yes, second day,' repeated the lady with an air of  impatience.
  'Can't you say who won the Helter-Skelter Plate when  you're asked the question civilly?'    'I don't know, ma'am.
'    'Don't know!' repeated the lady of the caravan; 'why, you were there.
  I saw you with my own eyes.
'    Nell was not a little alarmed to hear this, supposing that the lady  might be intimately acquainted with the firm of Short and Codlin; but  what followed tended to reassure her.
    'And very sorry I was,' said the lady of the caravan, 'to see you in  company with a Punch; a low, practical, wulgar wretch, that people  should scorn to look at.
'    'I was not there by choice,' returned the child; 'we didn't know our  way, and the two men were very kind to us, and let us travel with them.
  Do you--do you know them, ma'am?'    'Know 'em, child!' cried the lady of the caravan in a sort of shriek.
  'Know them!  But you're young and inexperienced, and that's your excuse  for asking sich a question.
  Do I look as if I know'd 'em, does the  caravan look as if it know'd 'em?'    'No, ma'am, no,' said the child, fearing she had committed some  grievous fault.
  'I beg your pardon.
'    It was granted immediately, though the lady still appeared much ruffled  and discomposed by the degrading supposition.
  The child then explained  that they had left the races on the first day, and were travelling to  the next town on that road, where they purposed to spend the night.
  As  the countenance of the stout lady began to clear up, she ventured to  inquire how far it was.
  The reply--which the stout lady did not come  to, until she had thoroughly explained that she went to the races on  the first day in a gig, and as an expedition of pleasure, and that her  presence there had no connexion with any matters of business or  profit--was, that the town was eight miles off.
    This discouraging information a little dashed the child, who could  scarcely repress a tear as she glanced along the darkening road.
  Her  grandfather made no complaint, but he sighed heavily as he leaned upon  his staff, and vainly tried to pierce the dusty distance.
    The lady of the caravan was in the act of gathering her tea equipage  together preparatory to clearing the table, but noting the child's  anxious manner she hesitated and stopped.
  The child curtseyed, thanked  her for her information, and giving her hand to the old man had already  got some fifty yards or so away, when the lady of the caravan called to  her to return.
    'Come nearer, nearer still,' said she, beckoning to her to ascend the  steps.
  'Are you hungry, child?'    'Not very, but we are tired, and it's--it IS a long way.
'    'Well, hungry or not, you had better have some tea,' rejoined her new  acquaintance.
  'I suppose you are agreeable to that, old gentleman?'    The grandfather humbly pulled off his hat and thanked her.
  The lady of  the caravan then bade him come up the steps likewise, but the drum  proving an inconvenient table for two, they descended again, and sat  upon the grass, where she handed down to them the tea-tray, the bread  and butter, the knuckle of ham, and in short everything of which she  had partaken herself, except the bottle which she had already embraced  an opportunity of slipping into her pocket.
    'Set 'em out near the hind wheels, child, that's the best place,' said  their friend, superintending the arrangements from above.
  'Now hand up  the teapot for a little more hot water, and a pinch of fresh tea, and  then both of you eat and drink as much as you can, and don't spare  anything; that's all I ask of you.
'    They might perhaps have carried out the lady's wish, if it had been  less freely expressed, or even if it had not been expressed at all.
  But as this direction relieved them from any shadow of delicacy or  uneasiness, they made a hearty meal and enjoyed it to the utmost.
    While they were thus engaged, the lady of the caravan alighted on the  earth, and with her hands clasped behind her, and her large bonnet  trembling excessively, walked up and down in a measured tread and very  stately manner, surveying the caravan from time to time with an air of  calm delight, and deriving particular gratification from the red panels  and the brass knocker.
  When she had taken this gentle exercise for  some time, she sat down upon the steps and called 'George'; whereupon a  man in a carter's frock, who had been so shrouded in a hedge up to this  time as to see everything that passed without being seen himself,  parted the twigs that concealed him, and appeared in a sitting  attitude, supporting on his legs a baking-dish and a half-gallon stone  bottle, and bearing in his right hand a knife, and in his left a fork.
    'Yes, Missus,' said George.
    'How did you find the cold pie, George?'    'It warn't amiss, mum.
'    'And the beer,' said the lady of the caravan, with an appearance of  being more interested in this question than the last; 'is it passable,  George?'    'It's more flatterer than it might be,' George returned, 'but it an't  so bad for all that.
'    To set the mind of his mistress at rest, he took a sip (amounting in  quantity to a pint or thereabouts) from the stone bottle, and then  smacked his lips, winked his eye, and nodded his head.
  No doubt with  the same amiable desire, he immediately resumed his knife and fork, as  a practical assurance that the beer had wrought no bad effect upon his  appetite.
    The lady of the caravan looked on approvingly for some time, and then  said,    'Have you nearly finished?'    'Wery nigh, mum.
'  And indeed, after scraping the dish all round with  his knife and carrying the choice brown morsels to his mouth, and after  taking such a scientific pull at the stone bottle that, by degrees  almost imperceptible to the sight, his head went further and further  back until he lay nearly at his full length upon the ground, this  gentleman declared himself quite disengaged, and came forth from his  retreat.
    'I hope I haven't hurried you, George,' said his mistress, who appeared  to have a great sympathy with his late pursuit.
    'If you have,' returned the follower, wisely reserving himself for any  favourable contingency that might occur, 'we must make up for it next  time, that's all.
'    'We are not a heavy load, George?'    'That's always what the ladies say,' replied the man, looking a long  way round, as if he were appealing to Nature in general against such  monstrous propositions.
  'If you see a woman a driving, you'll always  perceive that she never will keep her whip still; the horse can't go  fast enough for her.
  If cattle have got their proper load, you never  can persuade a woman that they'll not bear something more.
  What is the  cause of this here?'    'Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses, if we  took them with us?' asked his mistress, offering no reply to the  philosophical inquiry, and pointing to Nell and the old man, who were  painfully preparing to resume their journey on foot.
    'They'd make a difference in course,' said George doggedly.
    'Would they make much difference?' repeated his mistress.
  'They can't  be very heavy.
'    'The weight o' the pair, mum,' said George, eyeing them with the look  of a man who was calculating within half an ounce or so, 'would be a  trifle under that of Oliver Cromwell.
'    Nell was very much surprised that the man should be so accurately  acquainted with the weight of one whom she had read of in books as  having lived considerably before their time, but speedily forgot the  subject in the joy of hearing that they were to go forward in the  caravan, for which she thanked its lady with unaffected earnestness.
  She helped with great readiness and alacrity to put away the tea-things  and other matters that were lying about, and, the horses being by that  time harnessed, mounted into the vehicle, followed by her delighted  grandfather.
  Their patroness then shut the door and sat herself down  by her drum at an open window; and, the steps being struck by George  and stowed under the carriage, away they went, with a great noise of  flapping and creaking and straining, and the bright brass knocker,  which nobody ever knocked at, knocking one perpetual double knock of  its own accord as they jolted heavily along.
              When they had travelled slowly forward for some short distance, Nell  ventured to steal a look round the caravan and observe it more closely.
  One half of it--that moiety in which the comfortable proprietress was  then seated--was carpeted, and so partitioned off at the further end as  to accommodate a sleeping-place, constructed after the fashion of a  berth on board ship, which was shaded, like the little windows, with  fair white curtains, and looked comfortable enough, though by what kind  of gymnastic exercise the lady of the caravan ever contrived to get  into it, was an unfathomable mystery.
  The other half served for a  kitchen, and was fitted up with a stove whose small chimney passed  through the roof.
  It held also a closet or larder, several chests, a  great pitcher of water, and a few cooking-utensils and articles of  crockery.
  These latter necessaries hung upon the walls, which, in that  portion of the establishment devoted to the lady of the caravan, were  ornamented with such gayer and lighter decorations as a triangle and a  couple of well-thumbed tambourines.
    The lady of the caravan sat at one window in all the pride and poetry  of the musical instruments, and little Nell and her grandfather sat at  the other in all the humility of the kettle and saucepans, while the  machine jogged on and shifted the darkening prospect very slowly.
  At  first the two travellers spoke little, and only in whispers, but as  they grew more familiar with the place they ventured to converse with  greater freedom, and talked about the country through which they were  passing, and the different objects that presented themselves, until the  old man fell asleep; which the lady of the caravan observing, invited  Nell to come and sit beside her.
    'Well, child,' she said, 'how do you like this way of travelling?'    Nell replied that she thought it was very pleasant indeed, to which the  lady assented in the case of people who had their spirits.
  For  herself, she said, she was troubled with a lowness in that respect  which required a constant stimulant; though whether the aforesaid  stimulant was derived from the suspicious bottle of which mention has  been already made or from other sources, she did not say.
    'That's the happiness of you young people,' she continued.
  'You don't  know what it is to be low in your feelings.
  You always have your  appetites too, and what a comfort that is.
'    Nell thought that she could sometimes dispense with her own appetite  very conveniently; and thought, moreover, that there was nothing either  in the lady's personal appearance or in her manner of taking tea, to  lead to the conclusion that her natural relish for meat and drink had  at all failed her.
  She silently assented, however, as in duty bound,  to what the lady had said, and waited until she should speak again.
    Instead of speaking, however, she sat looking at the child for a long  time in silence, and then getting up, brought out from a corner a large  roll of canvas about a yard in width, which she laid upon the floor and  spread open with her foot until it nearly reached from one end of the  caravan to the other.
    'There, child,' she said, 'read that.
'    Nell walked down it, and read aloud, in enormous black letters, the  inscription, 'JARLEY'S WAX-WORK.
'    'Read it again,' said the lady, complacently.
    'Jarley's Wax-Work,' repeated Nell.
    'That's me,' said the lady.
  'I am Mrs Jarley.
'    Giving the child an encouraging look, intended to reassure her and let  her know, that, although she stood in the presence of the original  Jarley, she must not allow herself to be utterly overwhelmed and borne  down, the lady of the caravan unfolded another scroll, whereon was the  inscription, 'One hundred figures the full size of life,' and then  another scroll, on which was written, 'The only stupendous collection  of real wax-work in the world,' and then several smaller scrolls with  such inscriptions as 'Now exhibiting within'--'The genuine and only  Jarley'--'Jarley's unrivalled collection'--'Jarley is the delight of  the Nobility and Gentry'--'The Royal Family are the patrons of Jarley.
'  When she had exhibited these leviathans of public announcement to the  astonished child, she brought forth specimens of the lesser fry in the  shape of hand-bills, some of which were couched in the form of parodies  on popular melodies, as 'Believe me if all Jarley's wax-work so  rare'--'I saw thy show in youthful prime'--'Over the water to Jarley;'  while, to consult all tastes, others were composed with a view to the  lighter and more facetious spirits, as a parody on the favourite air of  'If I had a donkey,' beginning,      If I know'd a donkey wot wouldn't go    To see Mrs JARLEY'S wax-work show,    Do you think I'd acknowledge him?  Oh no no!    Then run to Jarley's--    --besides several compositions in prose, purporting to be dialogues  between the Emperor of China and an oyster, or the Archbishop of  Canterbury and a dissenter on the subject of church-rates, but all  having the same moral, namely, that the reader must make haste to  Jarley's, and that children and servants were admitted at half-price.
  When she had brought all these testimonials of her important position  in society to bear upon her young companion, Mrs Jarley rolled them up,  and having put them carefully away, sat down again, and looked at the  child in triumph.
    'Never go into the company of a filthy Punch any more,' said Mrs  Jarley, 'after this.
'    'I never saw any wax-work, ma'am,' said Nell.
  'Is it funnier than  Punch?'    'Funnier!' said Mrs Jarley in a shrill voice.
  'It is not funny at all.
'    'Oh!' said Nell, with all possible humility.
    'It isn't funny at all,' repeated Mrs Jarley.
  'It's calm and--what's  that word again--critical?--no--classical, that's it--it's calm and  classical.
  No low beatings and knockings about, no jokings and  squeakings like your precious Punches, but always the same, with a  constantly unchanging air of coldness and gentility; and so like life,  that if wax-work only spoke and walked about, you'd hardly know the  difference.
  I won't go so far as to say, that, as it is, I've seen  wax-work quite like life, but I've certainly seen some life that was  exactly like wax-work.
'    'Is it here, ma'am?' asked Nell, whose curiosity was awakened by this  description.
    'Is what here, child?'    'The wax-work, ma'am.
'    'Why, bless you, child, what are you thinking of?  How could such a  collection be here, where you see everything except the inside of one  little cupboard and a few boxes?  It's gone on in the other wans to the  assembly-rooms, and there it'll be exhibited the day after to-morrow.
  You are going to the same town, and you'll see it I dare say.
  It's  natural to expect that you'll see it, and I've no doubt you will.
  I  suppose you couldn't stop away if you was to try ever so much.
'    'I shall not be in the town, I think, ma'am,' said the child.
    'Not there!' cried Mrs Jarley.
  'Then where will you be?'    'I--I--don't quite know.
  I am not certain.
'    'You don't mean to say that you're travelling about the country without  knowing where you're going to?' said the lady of the caravan.
  'What  curious people you are!  What line are you in?  You looked to me at the  races, child, as if you were quite out of your element, and had got  there by accident.
'    'We were there quite by accident,' returned Nell, confused by this  abrupt questioning.
  'We are poor people, ma'am, and are only wandering  about.
  We have nothing to do;--I wish we had.
'    'You amaze me more and more,' said Mrs Jarley, after remaining for some  time as mute as one of her own figures.
  'Why, what do you call  yourselves?  Not beggars?'    'Indeed, ma'am, I don't know what else we are,' returned the child.
    'Lord bless me,' said the lady of the caravan.
  'I never heard of such  a thing.
  Who'd have thought it!'    She remained so long silent after this exclamation, that Nell feared  she felt her having been induced to bestow her protection and  conversation upon one so poor, to be an outrage upon her dignity that  nothing could repair.
  This persuasion was rather confirmed than  otherwise by the tone in which she at length broke silence and said,    'And yet you can read.
  And write too, I shouldn't wonder?'    'Yes, ma'am,' said the child, fearful of giving new offence by the  confession.
    'Well, and what a thing that is,' returned Mrs Jarley.
  'I can't!'    Nell said 'indeed' in a tone which might imply, either that she was  reasonably surprised to find the genuine and only Jarley, who was the  delight of the Nobility and Gentry and the peculiar pet of the Royal  Family, destitute of these familiar arts; or that she presumed so great  a lady could scarcely stand in need of such ordinary accomplishments.
  In whatever way Mrs Jarley received the response, it did not provoke  her to further questioning, or tempt her into any more remarks at the  time, for she relapsed into a thoughtful silence, and remained in that  state so long that Nell withdrew to the other window and rejoined her  grandfather, who was now awake.
    At length the lady of the caravan shook off her fit of meditation, and,  summoning the driver to come under the window at which she was seated,  held a long conversation with him in a low tone of voice, as if she  were asking his advice on an important point, and discussing the pros  and cons of some very weighty matter.
  This conference at length  concluded, she drew in her head again, and beckoned Nell to approach.
    'And the old gentleman too,' said Mrs Jarley; 'for I want to have a  word with him.
  Do you want a good situation for your grand-daughter,  master?  If you do, I can put her in the way of getting one.
  What do  you say?'    'I can't leave her,' answered the old man.
  'We can't separate.
  What  would become of me without her?'    'I should have thought you were old enough to take care of yourself, if  you ever will be,' retorted Mrs Jarley sharply.
    'But he never will be,' said the child in an earnest whisper.
  'I fear  he never will be again.
  Pray do not speak harshly to him.
  We are very  thankful to you,' she added aloud; 'but neither of us could part from  the other if all the wealth of the world were halved between us.
'    Mrs Jarley was a little disconcerted by this reception of her proposal,  and looked at the old man, who tenderly took Nell's hand and detained  it in his own, as if she could have very well dispensed with his  company or even his earthly existence.
  After an awkward pause, she  thrust her head out of the window again, and had another conference  with the driver upon some point on which they did not seem to agree  quite so readily as on their former topic of discussion; but they  concluded at last, and she addressed the grandfather again.
    'If you're really disposed to employ yourself,' said Mrs Jarley, 'there  would be plenty for you to do in the way of helping to dust the  figures, and take the checks, and so forth.
  What I want your  grand-daughter for, is to point 'em out to the company; they would be  soon learnt, and she has a way with her that people wouldn't think  unpleasant, though she does come after me; for I've been always  accustomed to go round with visitors myself, which I should keep on  doing now, only that my spirits make a little ease absolutely  necessary.
  It's not a common offer, bear in mind,' said the lady,  rising into the tone and manner in which she was accustomed to address  her audiences; 'it's Jarley's wax-work, remember.
  The duty's very  light and genteel, the company particularly select, the exhibition  takes place in assembly-rooms, town-halls, large rooms at inns, or  auction galleries.
  There is none of your open-air wagrancy at  Jarley's, recollect; there is no tarpaulin and sawdust at Jarley's,  remember.
  Every expectation held out in the handbills is realised to  the utmost, and the whole forms an effect of imposing brilliancy  hitherto unrivalled in this kingdom.
  Remember that the price of  admission is only sixpence, and that this is an opportunity which may  never occur again!'    Descending from the sublime when she had reached this point, to the  details of common life, Mrs Jarley remarked that with reference to  salary she could pledge herself to no specific sum until she had  sufficiently tested Nell's abilities, and narrowly watched her in the  performance of her duties.
  But board and lodging, both for her and her  grandfather, she bound herself to provide, and she furthermore passed  her word that the board should always be good in quality, and in  quantity plentiful.
    Nell and her grandfather consulted together, and while they were so  engaged, Mrs Jarley with her hands behind her walked up and down the  caravan, as she had walked after tea on the dull earth, with uncommon  dignity and self-esteem.
  Nor will this appear so slight a circumstance  as to be unworthy of mention, when it is remembered that the caravan  was in uneasy motion all the time, and that none but a person of great  natural stateliness and acquired grace could have forborne to stagger.
    'Now, child?' cried Mrs Jarley, coming to a halt as Nell turned towards  her.
    'We are very much obliged to you, ma'am,' said Nell, 'and thankfully  accept your offer.
'    'And you'll never be sorry for it,' returned Mrs Jarley.
  'I'm pretty  sure of that.
  So as that's all settled, let us have a bit of supper.
'    In the meanwhile, the caravan blundered on as if it too had been  drinking strong beer and was drowsy, and came at last upon the paved  streets of a town which were clear of passengers, and quiet, for it was  by this time near midnight, and the townspeople were all abed.
  As it  was too late an hour to repair to the exhibition room, they turned  aside into a piece of waste ground that lay just within the old  town-gate, and drew up there for the night, near to another caravan,  which, notwithstanding that it bore on the lawful panel the great name  of Jarley, and was employed besides in conveying from place to place  the wax-work which was its country's pride, was designated by a  grovelling stamp-office as a 'Common Stage Waggon,' and numbered  too--seven thousand odd hundred--as though its precious freight were  mere flour or coals!    This ill-used machine being empty (for it had deposited its burden at  the place of exhibition, and lingered here until its services were  again required) was assigned to the old man as his sleeping-place for  the night; and within its wooden walls, Nell made him up the best bed  she could, from the materials at hand.
  For herself, she was to sleep  in Mrs Jarley's own travelling-carriage, as a signal mark of that  lady's favour and confidence.
    She had taken leave of her grandfather and was returning to the other  waggon, when she was tempted by the coolness of the night to linger for  a little while in the air.
  The moon was shining down upon the old  gateway of the town, leaving the low archway very black and dark; and  with a mingled sensation of curiosity and fear, she slowly approached  the gate, and stood still to look up at it, wondering to see how dark,  and grim, and old, and cold, it looked.
    There was an empty niche from which some old statue had fallen or been  carried away hundreds of years ago, and she was thinking what strange  people it must have looked down upon when it stood there, and how many  hard struggles might have taken place, and how many murders might have  been done, upon that silent spot, when there suddenly emerged from the  black shade of the arch, a man.
  The instant he appeared, she  recognised him--Who could have failed to recognise, in that instant,  the ugly misshapen Quilp!    The street beyond was so narrow, and the shadow of the houses on one  side of the way so deep, that he seemed to have risen out of the earth.
  But there he was.
  The child withdrew into a dark corner, and saw him  pass close to her.
  He had a stick in his hand, and, when he had got  clear of the shadow of the gateway, he leant upon it, looked  back--directly, as it seemed, towards where she stood--and beckoned.
    To her?  oh no, thank God, not to her; for as she stood, in an  extremity of fear, hesitating whether to scream for help, or come from  her hiding-place and fly, before he should draw nearer, there issued  slowly forth from the arch another figure--that of a boy--who carried  on his back a trunk.
    'Faster, sirrah!' cried Quilp, looking up at the old gateway, and  showing in the moonlight like some monstrous image that had come down  from its niche and was casting a backward glance at its old house,  'faster!'    'It's a dreadful heavy load, Sir,' the boy pleaded.
  'I've come on very  fast, considering.
'    '_You_ have come fast, considering!' retorted Quilp; 'you creep, you dog,  you crawl, you measure distance like a worm.
  There are the chimes now,  half-past twelve.
'    He stopped to listen, and then turning upon the boy with a suddenness  and ferocity that made him start, asked at what hour that London coach  passed the corner of the road.
  The boy replied, at one.
    'Come on then,' said Quilp, 'or I shall be too late.
  Faster--do you  hear me?  Faster.
'    The boy made all the speed he could, and Quilp led onward, constantly  turning back to threaten him, and urge him to greater haste.
  Nell did  not dare to move until they were out of sight and hearing, and then  hurried to where she had left her grandfather, feeling as if the very  passing of the dwarf so near him must have filled him with alarm and  terror.
  But he was sleeping soundly, and she softly withdrew.
    As she was making her way to her own bed, she determined to say nothing  of this adventure, as upon whatever errand the dwarf had come (and she  feared it must have been in search of them) it was clear by his inquiry  about the London coach that he was on his way homeward, and as he had  passed through that place, it was but reasonable to suppose that they  were safer from his inquiries there, than they could be elsewhere.
  These reflections did not remove her own alarm, for she had been too  much terrified to be easily composed, and felt as if she were hemmed in  by a legion of Quilps, and the very air itself were filled with them.
    The delight of the Nobility and Gentry and the patronised of Royalty  had, by some process of self-abridgment known only to herself, got into  her travelling bed, where she was snoring peacefully, while the large  bonnet, carefully disposed upon the drum, was revealing its glories by  the light of a dim lamp that swung from the roof.
  The child's bed was  already made upon the floor, and it was a great comfort to her to hear  the steps removed as soon as she had entered, and to know that all easy  communication between persons outside and the brass knocker was by this  means effectually prevented.
  Certain guttural sounds, too, which from  time to time ascended through the floor of the caravan, and a rustling  of straw in the same direction, apprised her that the driver was  couched upon the ground beneath, and gave her an additional feeling of  security.
    Notwithstanding these protections, she could get none but broken sleep  by fits and starts all night, for fear of Quilp, who throughout her  uneasy dreams was somehow connected with the wax-work, or was wax-work  himself, or was Mrs Jarley and wax-work too, or was himself, Mrs  Jarley, wax-work, and a barrel organ all in one, and yet not exactly  any of them either.
  At length, towards break of day, that deep sleep  came upon her which succeeds to weariness and over-watching, and which  has no consciousness but one of overpowering and irresistible enjoyment.
              Sleep hung upon the eyelids of the child so long, that, when she awoke,  Mrs Jarley was already decorated with her large bonnet, and actively  engaged in preparing breakfast.
  She received Nell's apology for being  so late with perfect good humour, and said that she should not have  roused her if she had slept on until noon.
    'Because it does you good,' said the lady of the caravan, 'when you're  tired, to sleep as long as ever you can, and get the fatigue quite off;  and that's another blessing of your time of life--you can sleep so very  sound.
'    'Have you had a bad night, ma'am?' asked Nell.
    'I seldom have anything else, child,' replied Mrs Jarley, with the air  of a martyr.
  'I sometimes wonder how I bear it.
'    Remembering the snores which had proceeded from that cleft in the  caravan in which the proprietress of the wax-work passed the night,  Nell rather thought she must have been dreaming of lying awake.
  However, she expressed herself very sorry to hear such a dismal account  of her state of health, and shortly afterwards sat down with her  grandfather and Mrs Jarley to breakfast.
  The meal finished, Nell  assisted to wash the cups and saucers, and put them in their proper  places, and these household duties performed, Mrs Jarley arrayed  herself in an exceedingly bright shawl for the purpose of making a  progress through the streets of the town.
    'The wan will come on to bring the boxes,' said Mrs Jarley, and you had  better come in it, child.
  I am obliged to walk, very much against my  will; but the people expect it of me, and public characters can't be  their own masters and mistresses in such matters as these.
  How do I  look, child?'    Nell returned a satisfactory reply, and Mrs Jarley, after sticking a  great many pins into various parts of her figure, and making several  abortive attempts to obtain a full view of her own back, was at last  satisfied with her appearance, and went forth majestically.
    The caravan followed at no great distance.
  As it went jolting through  the streets, Nell peeped from the window, curious to see in what kind  of place they were, and yet fearful of encountering at every turn the  dreaded face of Quilp.
  It was a pretty large town, with an open square  which they were crawling slowly across, and in the middle of which was  the Town-Hall, with a clock-tower and a weather-cock.
  There were  houses of stone, houses of red brick, houses of yellow brick, houses of  lath and plaster; and houses of wood, many of them very old, with  withered faces carved upon the beams, and staring down into the street.
  These had very little winking windows, and low-arched doors, and, in  some of the narrower ways, quite overhung the pavement.
  The streets  were very clean, very sunny, very empty, and very dull.
  A few idle men  lounged about the two inns, and the empty market-place, and the  tradesmen's doors, and some old people were dozing in chairs outside an  alms-house wall; but scarcely any passengers who seemed bent on going  anywhere, or to have any object in view, went by; and if perchance some  straggler did, his footsteps echoed on the hot bright pavement for  minutes afterwards.
  Nothing seemed to be going on but the clocks, and  they had such drowzy faces, such heavy lazy hands, and such cracked  voices that they surely must have been too slow.
  The very dogs were  all asleep, and the flies, drunk with moist sugar in the grocer's shop,  forgot their wings and briskness, and baked to death in dusty corners  of the window.
    Rumbling along with most unwonted noise, the caravan stopped at last at  the place of exhibition, where Nell dismounted amidst an admiring group  of children, who evidently supposed her to be an important item of the  curiosities, and were fully impressed with the belief that her  grandfather was a cunning device in wax.
  The chests were taken out  with all convenient despatch, and taken in to be unlocked by Mrs  Jarley, who, attended by George and another man in velveteen shorts and  a drab hat ornamented with turnpike tickets, were waiting to dispose  their contents (consisting of red festoons and other ornamental devices  in upholstery work) to the best advantage in the decoration of the room.
    They all got to work without loss of time, and very busy they were.
  As  the stupendous collection were yet concealed by cloths, lest the  envious dust should injure their complexions, Nell bestirred herself to  assist in the embellishment of the room, in which her grandfather also  was of great service.
  The two men being well used to it, did a great  deal in a short time; and Mrs Jarley served out the tin tacks from a  linen pocket like a toll-collector's which she wore for the purpose,  and encouraged her assistants to renewed exertion.
    While they were thus employed, a tallish gentleman with a hook nose and  black hair, dressed in a military surtout very short and tight in the  sleeves, and which had once been frogged and braided all over, but was  now sadly shorn of its garniture and quite threadbare--dressed too in  ancient grey pantaloons fitting tight to the leg, and a pair of pumps  in the winter of their existence--looked in at the door and smiled  affably.
  Mrs Jarley's back being then towards him, the military  gentleman shook his forefinger as a sign that her myrmidons were not to  apprise her of his presence, and stealing up close behind her, tapped  her on the neck, and cried playfully 'Boh!'    'What, Mr Slum!' cried the lady of the wax-work.
  'Lot! who'd have  thought of seeing you here!'    ''Pon my soul and honour,' said Mr Slum, 'that's a good remark.
  'Pon  my soul and honour that's a wise remark.
  Who would have thought it!  George, my faithful feller, how are you?'    George received this advance with a surly indifference, observing that  he was well enough for the matter of that, and hammering lustily all  the time.
    'I came here,' said the military gentleman turning to Mrs Jarley--''pon  my soul and honour I hardly know what I came here for.
  It would  puzzle me to tell you, it would by Gad.
  I wanted a little inspiration,  a little freshening up, a little change of ideas, and-- 'Pon my soul  and honour,' said the military gentleman, checking himself and looking  round the room, 'what a devilish classical thing this is! by Gad, it's  quite Minervian.
'    'It'll look well enough when it comes to be finished,' observed Mrs  Jarley.
    'Well enough!' said Mr Slum.
  'Will you believe me when I say it's the  delight of my life to have dabbled in poetry, when I think I've  exercised my pen upon this charming theme?  By the way--any orders?  Is  there any little thing I can do for you?'    'It comes so very expensive, sir,' replied Mrs Jarley, 'and I really  don't think it does much good.
'    'Hush!  No, no!' returned Mr Slum, elevating his hand.
  'No fibs.
  I'll  not hear it.
  Don't say it don't do good.
  Don't say it.
  I know  better!'    'I don't think it does,' said Mrs Jarley.
    'Ha, ha!' cried Mr Slum, 'you're giving way, you're coming down.
  Ask  the perfumers, ask the blacking-makers, ask the hatters, ask the old  lottery-office-keepers--ask any man among 'em what my poetry has done  for him, and mark my words, he blesses the name of Slum.
  If he's an  honest man, he raises his eyes to heaven, and blesses the name of  Slum--mark that!  You are acquainted with Westminster Abbey, Mrs  Jarley?'    'Yes, surely.
'    'Then upon my soul and honour, ma'am, you'll find in a certain angle of  that dreary pile, called Poets' Corner, a few smaller names than Slum,'  retorted that gentleman, tapping himself expressively on the forehead  to imply that there was some slight quantity of brain behind it.
  'I've  got a little trifle here, now,' said Mr Slum, taking off his hat which  was full of scraps of paper, 'a little trifle here, thrown off in the  heat of the moment, which I should say was exactly the thing you wanted  to set this place on fire with.
  It's an acrostic--the name at this  moment is Warren, and the idea's a convertible one, and a positive  inspiration for Jarley.
  Have the acrostic.
'    'I suppose it's very dear,' said Mrs Jarley.
    'Five shillings,' returned Mr Slum, using his pencil as a toothpick.
  'Cheaper than any prose.
'    'I couldn't give more than three,' said Mrs Jarley.
    '--And six,' retorted Slum.
  'Come.
  Three-and-six.
'    Mrs Jarley was not proof against the poet's insinuating manner, and Mr  Slum entered the order in a small note-book as a three-and-sixpenny  one.
  Mr Slum then withdrew to alter the acrostic, after taking a most  affectionate leave of his patroness, and promising to return, as soon  as he possibly could, with a fair copy for the printer.
    As his presence had not interfered with or interrupted the  preparations, they were now far advanced, and were completed shortly  after his departure.
  When the festoons were all put up as tastily as  they might be, the stupendous collection was uncovered, and there were  displayed, on a raised platform some two feet from the floor, running  round the room and parted from the rude public by a crimson rope breast  high, divers sprightly effigies of celebrated characters, singly and in  groups, clad in glittering dresses of various climes and times, and  standing more or less unsteadily upon their legs, with their eyes very  wide open, and their nostrils very much inflated, and the muscles of  their legs and arms very strongly developed, and all their countenances  expressing great surprise.
  All the gentlemen were very pigeon-breasted  and very blue about the beards; and all the ladies were miraculous  figures; and all the ladies and all the gentlemen were looking  intensely nowhere, and staring with extraordinary earnestness at  nothing.
    When Nell had exhausted her first raptures at this glorious sight, Mrs  Jarley ordered the room to be cleared of all but herself and the child,  and, sitting herself down in an arm-chair in the centre, formally  invested Nell with a willow wand, long used by herself for pointing out  the characters, and was at great pains to instruct her in her duty.
    'That,' said Mrs Jarley in her exhibition tone, as Nell touched a  figure at the beginning of the platform, 'is an unfortunate Maid of  Honour in the Time of Queen Elizabeth, who died from pricking her  finger in consequence of working upon a Sunday.
  Observe the blood  which is trickling from her finger; also the gold-eyed needle of the  period, with which she is at work.
'    All this, Nell repeated twice or thrice: pointing to the finger and the  needle at the right times: and then passed on to the next.
    'That, ladies and gentlemen,' said Mrs Jarley, 'is Jasper Packlemerton  of atrocious memory, who courted and married fourteen wives, and  destroyed them all, by tickling the soles of their feet when they were  sleeping in the consciousness of innocence and virtue.
  On being  brought to the scaffold and asked if he was sorry for what he had done,  he replied yes, he was sorry for having let 'em off so easy, and hoped  all Christian husbands would pardon him the offence.
  Let this be a  warning to all young ladies to be particular in the character of the  gentlemen of their choice.
  Observe that his fingers are curled as if  in the act of tickling, and that his face is represented with a wink,  as he appeared when committing his barbarous murders.
'    When Nell knew all about Mr Packlemerton, and could say it without  faltering, Mrs Jarley passed on to the fat man, and then to the thin  man, the tall man, the short man, the old lady who died of dancing at a  hundred and thirty-two, the wild boy of the woods, the woman who  poisoned fourteen families with pickled walnuts, and other historical  characters and interesting but misguided individuals.
  And so well did  Nell profit by her instructions, and so apt was she to remember them,  that by the time they had been shut up together for a couple of hours,  she was in full possession of the history of the whole establishment,  and perfectly competent to the enlightenment of visitors.
    Mrs Jarley was not slow to express her admiration at this happy result,  and carried her young friend and pupil to inspect the remaining  arrangements within doors, by virtue of which the passage had been  already converted into a grove of green-baize hung with the inscription  she had already seen (Mr Slum's productions), and a highly ornamented  table placed at the upper end for Mrs Jarley herself, at which she was  to preside and take the money, in company with his Majesty King George  the Third, Mr Grimaldi as clown, Mary Queen of Scots, an anonymous  gentleman of the Quaker persuasion, and Mr Pitt holding in his hand a  correct model of the bill for the imposition of the window duty.
  The  preparations without doors had not been neglected either; a nun of  great personal attractions was telling her beads on the little portico  over the door; and a brigand with the blackest possible head of hair,  and the clearest possible complexion, was at that moment going round  the town in a cart, consulting the miniature of a lady.
    It now only remained that Mr Slum's compositions should be judiciously  distributed; that the pathetic effusions should find their way to all  private houses and tradespeople; and that the parody commencing 'If I  know'd a donkey,' should be confined to the taverns, and circulated  only among the lawyers' clerks and choice spirits of the place.
  When  this had been done, and Mrs Jarley had waited upon the boarding-schools  in person, with a handbill composed expressly for them, in which it was  distinctly proved that wax-work refined the mind, cultivated the taste,  and enlarged the sphere of the human understanding, that indefatigable  lady sat down to dinner, and drank out of the suspicious bottle to a  flourishing campaign.
              Unquestionably Mrs Jarley had an inventive genius.
  In the midst of the  various devices for attracting visitors to the exhibition, little Nell  was not forgotten.
  The light cart in which the Brigand usually made  his perambulations being gaily dressed with flags and streamers, and  the Brigand placed therein, contemplating the miniature of his beloved  as usual, Nell was accommodated with a seat beside him, decorated with  artificial flowers, and in this state and ceremony rode slowly through  the town every morning, dispersing handbills from a basket, to the  sound of drum and trumpet.
  The beauty of the child, coupled with her  gentle and timid bearing, produced quite a sensation in the little  country place.
  The Brigand, heretofore a source of exclusive interest  in the streets, became a mere secondary consideration, and to be  important only as a part of the show of which she was the chief  attraction.
  Grown-up folks began to be interested in the bright-eyed  girl, and some score of little boys fell desperately in love, and  constantly left enclosures of nuts and apples, directed in small-text,  at the wax-work door.
    This desirable impression was not lost on Mrs Jarley, who, lest Nell  should become too cheap, soon sent the Brigand out alone again, and  kept her in the exhibition room, where she described the figures every  half-hour to the great satisfaction of admiring audiences.
  And these  audiences were of a very superior description, including a great many  young ladies' boarding-schools, whose favour Mrs Jarley had been at  great pains to conciliate, by altering the face and costume of Mr  Grimaldi as clown to represent Mr Lindley Murray as he appeared when  engaged in the composition of his English Grammar, and turning a  murderess of great renown into Mrs Hannah More--both of which  likenesses were admitted by Miss Monflathers, who was at the head of  the head Boarding and Day Establishment in the town, and who  condescended to take a Private View with eight chosen young ladies, to  be quite startling from their extreme correctness.
  Mr Pitt in a  nightcap and bedgown, and without his boots, represented the poet  Cowper with perfect exactness; and Mary Queen of Scots in a dark wig,  white shirt-collar, and male attire, was such a complete image of Lord  Byron that the young ladies quite screamed when they saw it.
  Miss  Monflathers, however, rebuked this enthusiasm, and took occasion to  reprove Mrs Jarley for not keeping her collection more select:  observing that His Lordship had held certain opinions quite  incompatible with wax-work honours, and adding something about a Dean  and Chapter, which Mrs Jarley did not understand.
    Although her duties were sufficiently laborious, Nell found in the lady  of the caravan a very kind and considerate person, who had not only a  peculiar relish for being comfortable herself, but for making everybody  about her comfortable also; which latter taste, it may be remarked, is,  even in persons who live in much finer places than caravans, a far more  rare and uncommon one than the first, and is not by any means its  necessary consequence.
  As her popularity procured her various little  fees from the visitors on which her patroness never demanded any toll,  and as her grandfather too was well-treated and useful, she had no  cause of anxiety in connexion with the wax-work, beyond that which  sprung from her recollection of Quilp, and her fears that he might  return and one day suddenly encounter them.
    Quilp indeed was a perpetual night-mare to the child, who was  constantly haunted by a vision of his ugly face and stunted figure.
  She slept, for their better security, in the room where the wax-work  figures were, and she never retired to this place at night but she  tortured herself--she could not help it--with imagining a resemblance,  in some one or other of their death-like faces, to the dwarf, and this  fancy would sometimes so gain upon her that she would almost believe he  had removed the figure and stood within the clothes.
  Then there were  so many of them with their great glassy eyes--and, as they stood one  behind the other all about her bed, they looked so like living  creatures, and yet so unlike in their grim stillness and silence, that  she had a kind of terror of them for their own sakes, and would often  lie watching their dusky figures until she was obliged to rise and  light a candle, or go and sit at the open window and feel a  companionship in the bright stars.
  At these times, she would recall  the old house and the window at which she used to sit alone; and then  she would think of poor Kit and all his kindness, until the tears came  into her eyes, and she would weep and smile together.
    Often and anxiously at this silent hour, her thoughts reverted to her  grandfather, and she would wonder how much he remembered of their  former life, and whether he was ever really mindful of the change in  their condition and of their late helplessness and destitution.
  When  they were wandering about, she seldom thought of this, but now she  could not help considering what would become of them if he fell sick,  or her own strength were to fail her.
  He was very patient and willing,  happy to execute any little task, and glad to be of use; but he was in  the same listless state, with no prospect of improvement--a mere  child--a poor, thoughtless, vacant creature--a harmless fond old man,  susceptible of tender love and regard for her, and of pleasant and  painful impressions, but alive to nothing more.
  It made her very sad  to know that this was so--so sad to see it that sometimes when he sat  idly by, smiling and nodding to her when she looked round, or when he  caressed some little child and carried it to and fro, as he was fond of  doing by the hour together, perplexed by its simple questions, yet  patient under his own infirmity, and seeming almost conscious of it  too, and humbled even before the mind of an infant--so sad it made her  to see him thus, that she would burst into tears, and, withdrawing into  some secret place, fall down upon her knees and pray that he might be  restored.
    But, the bitterness of her grief was not in beholding him in this  condition, when he was at least content and tranquil, nor in her  solitary meditations on his altered state, though these were trials for  a young heart.
  Cause for deeper and heavier sorrow was yet to come.
    One evening, a holiday night with them, Nell and her grandfather went  out to walk.
  They had been rather closely confined for some days, and  the weather being warm, they strolled a long distance.
  Clear of the  town, they took a footpath which struck through some pleasant fields,  judging that it would terminate in the road they quitted and enable  them to return that way.
  It made, however, a much wider circuit than  they had supposed, and thus they were tempted onward until sunset, when  they reached the track of which they were in search, and stopped to  rest.
    It had been gradually getting overcast, and now the sky was dark and  lowering, save where the glory of the departing sun piled up masses of  gold and burning fire, decaying embers of which gleamed here and there  through the black veil, and shone redly down upon the earth.
  The wind  began to moan in hollow murmurs, as the sun went down carrying glad day  elsewhere; and a train of dull clouds coming up against it, menaced  thunder and lightning.
  Large drops of rain soon began to fall, and, as  the storm clouds came sailing onward, others supplied the void they  left behind and spread over all the sky.
  Then was heard the low  rumbling of distant thunder, then the lightning quivered, and then the  darkness of an hour seemed to have gathered in an instant.
    Fearful of taking shelter beneath a tree or hedge, the old man and the  child hurried along the high road, hoping to find some house in which  they could seek a refuge from the storm, which had now burst forth in  earnest, and every moment increased in violence.
  Drenched with the  pelting rain, confused by the deafening thunder, and bewildered by the  glare of the forked lightning, they would have passed a solitary house  without being aware of its vicinity, had not a man, who was standing at  the door, called lustily to them to enter.
    'Your ears ought to be better than other folks' at any rate, if you  make so little of the chance of being struck blind,' he said,  retreating from the door and shading his eyes with his hands as the  jagged lightning came again.
  'What were you going past for, eh?' he  added, as he closed the door and led the way along a passage to a room  behind.
    'We didn't see the house, sir, till we heard you calling,' Nell replied.
    'No wonder,' said the man, 'with this lightning in one's eyes,  by-the-by.
  You had better stand by the fire here, and dry yourselves a  bit.
  You can call for what you like if you want anything.
  If you  don't want anything, you are not obliged to give an order.
  Don't be  afraid of that.
  This is a public-house, that's all.
  The Valiant  Soldier is pretty well known hereabouts.
'    'Is this house called the Valiant Soldier, Sir?' asked Nell.
    'I thought everybody knew that,' replied the landlord.
  'Where have you  come from, if you don't know the Valiant Soldier as well as the church  catechism?  This is the Valiant Soldier, by James Groves--Jem  Groves--honest Jem Groves, as is a man of unblemished moral character,  and has a good dry skittle-ground.
  If any man has got anything to say  again Jem Groves, let him say it TO Jem Groves, and Jem Groves can  accommodate him with a customer on any terms from four pound a side to  forty.
    With these words, the speaker tapped himself on the waistcoat to  intimate that he was the Jem Groves so highly eulogized; sparred  scientifically at a counterfeit Jem Groves, who was sparring at society  in general from a black frame over the chimney-piece; and, applying a  half-emptied glass of spirits and water to his lips, drank Jem Groves's  health.
    The night being warm, there was a large screen drawn across the room,  for a barrier against the heat of the fire.
  It seemed as if somebody  on the other side of this screen had been insinuating doubts of Mr  Groves's prowess, and had thereby given rise to these egotistical  expressions, for Mr Groves wound up his defiance by giving a loud knock  upon it with his knuckles and pausing for a reply from the other side.
    'There an't many men,' said Mr Groves, no answer being returned, 'who  would ventur' to cross Jem Groves under his own roof.
  There's only one  man, I know, that has nerve enough for that, and that man's not a  hundred mile from here neither.
  But he's worth a dozen men, and I let  him say of me whatever he likes in consequence--he knows that.
'    In return for this complimentary address, a very gruff hoarse voice  bade Mr Groves 'hold his noise and light a candle.
'  And the same voice  remarked that the same gentleman 'needn't waste his breath in brag, for  most people knew pretty well what sort of stuff he was made of.
'    'Nell, they're--they're playing cards,' whispered the old man, suddenly  interested.
  'Don't you hear them?'    'Look sharp with that candle,' said the voice; 'it's as much as I can  do to see the pips on the cards as it is; and get this shutter closed  as quick as you can, will you?  Your beer will be the worse for  to-night's thunder I expect.
--Game!  Seven-and-sixpence to me, old  Isaac.
  Hand over.
'    'Do you hear, Nell, do you hear them?' whispered the old man again,  with increased earnestness, as the money chinked upon the table.
    'I haven't seen such a storm as this,' said a sharp cracked voice of  most disagreeable quality, when a tremendous peal of thunder had died  away, 'since the night when old Luke Withers won thirteen times running  on the red.
  We all said he had the Devil's luck and his own, and as it  was the kind of night for the Devil to be out and busy, I suppose he  was looking over his shoulder, if anybody could have seen him.
'    'Ah!' returned the gruff voice; 'for all old Luke's winning through  thick and thin of late years, I remember the time when he was the  unluckiest and unfortunatest of men.
  He never took a dice-box in his  hand, or held a card, but he was plucked, pigeoned, and cleaned out  completely.
'    'Do you hear what he says?' whispered the old man.
  'Do you hear that,  Nell?'    The child saw with astonishment and alarm that his whole appearance had  undergone a complete change.
  His face was flushed and eager, his eyes  were strained, his teeth set, his breath came short and thick, and the  hand he laid upon her arm trembled so violently that she shook beneath  its grasp.
    'Bear witness,' he muttered, looking upward, 'that I always said it;  that I knew it, dreamed of it, felt it was the truth, and that it must  be so!  What money have we, Nell?  Come!  I saw you with money  yesterday.
  What money have we?  Give it to me.
'    'No, no, let me keep it, grandfather,' said the frightened child.
  'Let  us go away from here.
  Do not mind the rain.
  Pray let us go.
'    'Give it to me, I say,' returned the old man fiercely.
  'Hush, hush,  don't cry, Nell.
  If I spoke sharply, dear, I didn't mean it.
  It's for  thy good.
  I have wronged thee, Nell, but I will right thee yet, I will  indeed.
  Where is the money?'    'Do not take it,' said the child.
  'Pray do not take it, dear.
  For  both our sakes let me keep it, or let me throw it away--better let me  throw it away, than you take it now.
  Let us go; do let us go.
'    'Give me the money,' returned the old man, 'I must have it.
  There--there--that's my dear Nell.
  I'll right thee one day, child,  I'll right thee, never fear!'    She took from her pocket a little purse.
  He seized it with the same  rapid impatience which had characterised his speech, and hastily made  his way to the other side of the screen.
  It was impossible to restrain  him, and the trembling child followed close behind.
    The landlord had placed a light upon the table, and was engaged in  drawing the curtain of the window.
  The speakers whom they had heard  were two men, who had a pack of cards and some silver money between  them, while upon the screen itself the games they had played were  scored in chalk.
  The man with the rough voice was a burly fellow of  middle age, with large black whiskers, broad cheeks, a coarse wide  mouth, and bull neck, which was pretty freely displayed as his shirt  collar was only confined by a loose red neckerchief.
  He wore his hat,  which was of a brownish-white, and had beside him a thick knotted  stick.
  The other man, whom his companion had called Isaac, was of a  more slender figure--stooping, and high in the shoulders--with a very  ill-favoured face, and a most sinister and villainous squint.
    'Now old gentleman,' said Isaac, looking round.
  'Do you know either of  us?  This side of the screen is private, sir.
'    'No offence, I hope,' returned the old man.
    'But by G--, sir, there is offence,' said the other, interrupting him,  'when you intrude yourself upon a couple of gentlemen who are  particularly engaged.
'    'I had no intention to offend,' said the old man, looking anxiously at  the cards.
  'I thought that--'    'But you had no right to think, sir,' retorted the other.
  'What the  devil has a man at your time of life to do with thinking?'    'Now bully boy,' said the stout man, raising his eyes from his cards  for the first time, 'can't you let him speak?'    The landlord, who had apparently resolved to remain neutral until he  knew which side of the question the stout man would espouse, chimed in  at this place with 'Ah, to be sure, can't you let him speak, Isaac  List?'    'Can't I let him speak,' sneered Isaac in reply, mimicking as nearly as  he could, in his shrill voice, the tones of the landlord.
  'Yes, I can  let him speak, Jemmy Groves.
'    'Well then, do it, will you?' said the landlord.
    Mr List's squint assumed a portentous character, which seemed to  threaten a prolongation of this controversy, when his companion, who  had been looking sharply at the old man, put a timely stop to it.
    'Who knows,' said he, with a cunning look, 'but the gentleman may have  civilly meant to ask if he might have the honour to take a hand with  us!'    'I did mean it,' cried the old man.
  'That is what I mean.
  That is  what I want now!'    'I thought so,' returned the same man.
  'Then who knows but the  gentleman, anticipating our objection to play for love, civilly desired  to play for money?'    The old man replied by shaking the little purse in his eager hand, and  then throwing it down upon the table, and gathering up the cards as a  miser would clutch at gold.
    'Oh!  That indeed,' said Isaac; 'if that's what the gentleman meant, I  beg the gentleman's pardon.
  Is this the gentleman's little purse?  A  very pretty little purse.
  Rather a light purse,' added Isaac, throwing  it into the air and catching it dexterously, 'but enough to amuse a  gentleman for half an hour or so.
'    'We'll make a four-handed game of it, and take in Groves,' said the  stout man.
  'Come, Jemmy.
'    The landlord, who conducted himself like one who was well used to such  little parties, approached the table and took his seat.
  The child, in  a perfect agony, drew her grandfather aside, and implored him, even  then, to come away.
    'Come; and we may be so happy,' said the child.
    'We WILL be happy,' replied the old man hastily.
  'Let me go, Nell.
  The means of happiness are on the cards and the dice.
  We must rise  from little winnings to great.
  There's little to be won here; but  great will come in time.
  I shall but win back my own, and it's all for  thee, my darling.
'    'God help us!' cried the child.
  'Oh! what hard fortune brought us  here?'    'Hush!' rejoined the old man laying his hand upon her mouth, 'Fortune  will not bear chiding.
  We must not reproach her, or she shuns us; I  have found that out.
'    'Now, mister,' said the stout man.
  'If you're not coming yourself,  give us the cards, will you?'    'I am coming,' cried the old man.
  'Sit thee down, Nell, sit thee down  and look on.
  Be of good heart, it's all for thee--all--every penny.
  I don't tell them, no, no, or else they wouldn't play, dreading the  chance that such a cause must give me.
  Look at them.
  See what they  are and what thou art.
  Who doubts that we must win!'    'The gentleman has thought better of it, and isn't coming,' said Isaac,  making as though he would rise from the table.
  'I'm sorry the  gentleman's daunted--nothing venture, nothing have--but the gentleman  knows best.
'    'Why I am ready.
  You have all been slow but me,' said the old man.
  'I  wonder who is more anxious to begin than I.
'    As he spoke he drew a chair to the table; and the other three closing  round it at the same time, the game commenced.
    The child sat by, and watched its progress with a troubled mind.
  Regardless of the run of luck, and mindful only of the desperate  passion which had its hold upon her grandfather, losses and gains were  to her alike.
  Exulting in some brief triumph, or cast down by a  defeat, there he sat so wild and restless, so feverishly and intensely  anxious, so terribly eager, so ravenous for the paltry stakes, that she  could have almost better borne to see him dead.
  And yet she was the  innocent cause of all this torture, and he, gambling with such a savage  thirst for gain as the most insatiable gambler never felt, had not one  selfish thought!    On the contrary, the other three--knaves and gamesters by their  trade--while intent upon their game, were yet as cool and quiet as if  every virtue had been centered in their breasts.
  Sometimes one would  look up to smile to another, or to snuff the feeble candle, or to  glance at the lightning as it shot through the open window and  fluttering curtain, or to listen to some louder peal of thunder than  the rest, with a kind of momentary impatience, as if it put him out;  but there they sat, with a calm indifference to everything but their  cards, perfect philosophers in appearance, and with no greater show of  passion or excitement than if they had been made of stone.
    The storm had raged for full three hours; the lightning had grown  fainter and less frequent; the thunder, from seeming to roll and break  above their heads, had gradually died away into a deep hoarse distance;  and still the game went on, and still the anxious child was quite  forgotten.
              At length the play came to an end, and Mr Isaac List rose the only  winner.
  Mat and the landlord bore their losses with professional  fortitude.
  Isaac pocketed his gains with the air of a man who had  quite made up his mind to win, all along, and was neither surprised nor  pleased.
    Nell's little purse was exhausted; but although it lay empty by his  side, and the other players had now risen from the table, the old man  sat poring over the cards, dealing them as they had been dealt before,  and turning up the different hands to see what each man would have held  if they had still been playing.
  He was quite absorbed in this  occupation, when the child drew near and laid her hand upon his  shoulder, telling him it was near midnight.
    'See the curse of poverty, Nell,' he said, pointing to the packs he had  spread out upon the table.
  'If I could have gone on a little longer,  only a little longer, the luck would have turned on my side.
  Yes, it's  as plain as the marks upon the cards.
  See here--and there--and here  again.
'    'Put them away,' urged the child.
  'Try to forget them.
'    'Try to forget them!' he rejoined, raising his haggard face to hers,  and regarding her with an incredulous stare.
  'To forget them!  How are  we ever to grow rich if I forget them?'    The child could only shake her head.
    'No, no, Nell,' said the old man, patting her cheek; 'they must not be  forgotten.
  We must make amends for this as soon as we can.
  Patience--patience, and we'll right thee yet, I promise thee.
  Lose  to-day, win to-morrow.
  And nothing can be won without anxiety and  care--nothing.
  Come, I am ready.
'    'Do you know what the time is?' said Mr Groves, who was smoking with  his friends.
  'Past twelve o'clock--'    '--And a rainy night,' added the stout man.
    'The Valiant Soldier, by James Groves.
  Good beds.
  Cheap entertainment  for man and beast,' said Mr Groves, quoting his sign-board.
  'Half-past  twelve o'clock.
'    'It's very late,' said the uneasy child.
  'I wish we had gone before.
  What will they think of us!  It will be two o'clock by the time we get  back.
  What would it cost, sir, if we stopped here?'    'Two good beds, one-and-sixpence; supper and beer one shilling; total  two shillings and sixpence,' replied the Valiant Soldier.
    Now, Nell had still the piece of gold sewn in her dress; and when she  came to consider the lateness of the hour, and the somnolent habits of  Mrs Jarley, and to imagine the state of consternation in which they  would certainly throw that good lady by knocking her up in the middle  of the night--and when she reflected, on the other hand, that if they  remained where they were, and rose early in the morning, they might get  back before she awoke, and could plead the violence of the storm by  which they had been overtaken, as a good apology for their absence--she  decided, after a great deal of hesitation, to remain.
  She therefore  took her grandfather aside, and telling him that she had still enough  left to defray the cost of their lodging, proposed that they should  stay there for the night.
    'If I had had but that money before--If I had only known of it a few  minutes ago!' muttered the old man.
    'We will decide to stop here if you please,' said Nell, turning hastily  to the landlord.
    'I think that's prudent,' returned Mr Groves.
  'You shall have your  suppers directly.
'    Accordingly, when Mr Groves had smoked his pipe out, knocked out the  ashes, and placed it carefully in a corner of the fire-place, with the  bowl downwards, he brought in the bread and cheese, and beer, with many  high encomiums upon their excellence, and bade his guests fall to, and  make themselves at home.
  Nell and her grandfather ate sparingly, for  both were occupied with their own reflections; the other gentlemen, for  whose constitutions beer was too weak and tame a liquid, consoled  themselves with spirits and tobacco.
    As they would leave the house very early in the morning, the child was  anxious to pay for their entertainment before they retired to bed.
  But  as she felt the necessity of concealing her little hoard from her  grandfather, and had to change the piece of gold, she took it secretly  from its place of concealment, and embraced an opportunity of following  the landlord when he went out of the room, and tendered it to him in  the little bar.
    'Will you give me the change here, if you please?' said the child.
    Mr James Groves was evidently surprised, and looked at the money, and  rang it, and looked at the child, and at the money again, as though he  had a mind to inquire how she came by it.
  The coin being genuine,  however, and changed at his house, he probably felt, like a wise  landlord, that it was no business of his.
  At any rate, he counted out  the change, and gave it her.
  The child was returning to the room where  they had passed the evening, when she fancied she saw a figure just  gliding in at the door.
  There was nothing but a long dark passage  between this door and the place where she had changed the money, and,  being very certain that no person had passed in or out while she stood  there, the thought struck her that she had been watched.
    But by whom?  When she re-entered the room, she found its inmates  exactly as she had left them.
  The stout fellow lay upon two chairs,  resting his head on his hand, and the squinting man reposed in a  similar attitude on the opposite side of the table.
  Between them sat  her grandfather, looking intently at the winner with a kind of hungry  admiration, and hanging upon his words as if he were some superior  being.
  She was puzzled for a moment, and looked round to see if any  else were there.
  No.
  Then she asked her grandfather in a whisper  whether anybody had left the room while she was absent.
  'No,' he said,  'nobody.
'    It must have been her fancy then; and yet it was strange, that, without  anything in her previous thoughts to lead to it, she should have  imagined this figure so very distinctly.
  She was still wondering and  thinking of it, when a girl came to light her to bed.
    The old man took leave of the company at the same time, and they went  up stairs together.
  It was a great, rambling house, with dull  corridors and wide staircases which the flaring candles seemed to make  more gloomy.
  She left her grandfather in his chamber, and followed her  guide to another, which was at the end of a passage, and approached by  some half-dozen crazy steps.
  This was prepared for her.
  The girl  lingered a little while to talk, and tell her grievances.
  She had not  a good place, she said; the wages were low, and the work was hard.
  She  was going to leave it in a fortnight; the child couldn't recommend her  to another, she supposed?  Instead she was afraid another would be  difficult to get after living there, for the house had a very  indifferent character; there was far too much card-playing, and such  like.
  She was very much mistaken if some of the people who came there  oftenest were quite as honest as they might be, but she wouldn't have  it known that she had said so, for the world.
  Then there were some  rambling allusions to a rejected sweetheart, who had threatened to go a  soldiering--a final promise of knocking at the door early in the  morning--and 'Good night.
'    The child did not feel comfortable when she was left alone.
  She could  not help thinking of the figure stealing through the passage down  stairs; and what the girl had said did not tend to reassure her.
  The  men were very ill-looking.
  They might get their living by robbing and  murdering travellers.
  Who could tell?    Reasoning herself out of these fears, or losing sight of them for a  little while, there came the anxiety to which the adventures of the  night gave rise.
  Here was the old passion awakened again in her  grandfather's breast, and to what further distraction it might tempt  him Heaven only knew.
  What fears their absence might have occasioned  already!  Persons might be seeking for them even then.
  Would they be  forgiven in the morning, or turned adrift again!  Oh!  why had they  stopped in that strange place?  It would have been better, under any  circumstances, to have gone on!    At last, sleep gradually stole upon her--a broken, fitful sleep,  troubled by dreams of falling from high towers, and waking with a start  and in great terror.
  A deeper slumber followed this--and then--What!  That figure in the room.
    A figure was there.
  Yes, she had drawn up the blind to admit the light  when it should be dawn, and there, between the foot of the bed and the  dark casement, it crouched and slunk along, groping its way with  noiseless hands, and stealing round the bed.
  She had no voice to cry  for help, no power to move, but lay still, watching it.
    On it came--on, silently and stealthily, to the bed's head.
  The breath  so near her pillow, that she shrunk back into it, lest those wandering  hands should light upon her face.
  Back again it stole to the  window--then turned its head towards her.
    The dark form was a mere blot upon the lighter darkness of the room,  but she saw the turning of the head, and felt and knew how the eyes  looked and the ears listened.
  There it remained, motionless as she.
  At length, still keeping the face towards her, it busied its hands in  something, and she heard the chink of money.
    Then, on it came again, silent and stealthy as before, and replacing  the garments it had taken from the bedside, dropped upon its hands and  knees, and crawled away.
  How slowly it seemed to move, now that she  could hear but not see it, creeping along the floor!  It reached the  door at last, and stood upon its feet.
  The steps creaked beneath its  noiseless tread, and it was gone.
    The first impulse of the child was to fly from the terror of being by  herself in that room--to have somebody by--not to be alone--and then  her power of speech would be restored.
  With no consciousness of having  moved, she gained the door.
    There was the dreadful shadow, pausing at the bottom of the steps.
    She could not pass it; she might have done so, perhaps, in the darkness  without being seized, but her blood curdled at the thought.
  The figure  stood quite still, and so did she; not boldly, but of necessity; for  going back into the room was hardly less terrible than going on.
    The rain beat fast and furiously without, and ran down in plashing  streams from the thatched roof.
  Some summer insect, with no escape  into the air, flew blindly to and fro, beating its body against the  walls and ceiling, and filling the silent place with murmurs.
  The  figure moved again.
  The child involuntarily did the same.
  Once in her  grandfather's room, she would be safe.
    It crept along the passage until it came to the very door she longed so  ardently to reach.
  The child, in the agony of being so near, had  almost darted forward with the design of bursting into the room and  closing it behind her, when the figure stopped again.
    The idea flashed suddenly upon her--what if it entered there, and had a  design upon the old man's life!  She turned faint and sick.
  It did.
  It went in.
  There was a light inside.
  The figure was now within the  chamber, and she, still dumb--quite dumb, and almost senseless--stood  looking on.
    The door was partly open.
  Not knowing what she meant to do, but  meaning to preserve him or be killed herself, she staggered forward and  looked in.
 What sight was that which met her view!    The bed had not been lain on, but was smooth and empty.
  And at a table  sat the old man himself; the only living creature there; his white face  pinched and sharpened by the greediness which made his eyes unnaturally  bright--counting the money of which his hands had robbed her.
              With steps more faltering and unsteady than those with which she had  approached the room, the child withdrew from the door, and groped her  way back to her own chamber.
  The terror she had lately felt was  nothing compared with that which now oppressed her.
  No strange robber,  no treacherous host conniving at the plunder of his guests, or stealing  to their beds to kill them in their sleep, no nightly prowler, however  terrible and cruel, could have awakened in her bosom half the dread  which the recognition of her silent visitor inspired.
  The grey-headed  old man gliding like a ghost into her room and acting the thief while  he supposed her fast asleep, then bearing off his prize and hanging  over it with the ghastly exultation she had witnessed, was  worse--immeasurably worse, and far more dreadful, for the moment, to  reflect upon--than anything her wildest fancy could have suggested.
  If he should return--there was no lock or bolt upon the door, and if,  distrustful of having left some money yet behind, he should come back  to seek for more--a vague awe and horror surrounded the idea of his  slinking in again with stealthy tread, and turning his face toward the  empty bed, while she shrank down close at his feet to avoid his touch,  which was almost insupportable.
  She sat and listened.
  Hark!  A  footstep on the stairs, and now the door was slowly opening.
  It was  but imagination, yet imagination had all the terrors of reality; nay,  it was worse, for the reality would have come and gone, and there an  end, but in imagination it was always coming, and never went away.
    The feeling which beset the child was one of dim uncertain horror.
  She  had no fear of the dear old grandfather, in whose love for her this  disease of the brain had been engendered; but the man she had seen that  night, wrapt in the game of chance, lurking in her room, and counting  the money by the glimmering light, seemed like another creature in his  shape, a monstrous distortion of his image, a something to recoil from,  and be the more afraid of, because it bore a likeness to him, and kept  close about her, as he did.
  She could scarcely connect her own  affectionate companion, save by his loss, with this old man, so like  yet so unlike him.
  She had wept to see him dull and quiet.
  How much  greater cause she had for weeping now!    The child sat watching and thinking of these things, until the phantom  in her mind so increased in gloom and terror, that she felt it would be  a relief to hear the old man's voice, or, if he were asleep, even to  see him, and banish some of the fears that clustered round his image.
  She stole down the stairs and passage again.
  The door was still ajar  as she had left it, and the candle burning as before.
    She had her own candle in her hand, prepared to say, if he were waking,  that she was uneasy and could not rest, and had come to see if his were  still alight.
  Looking into the room, she saw him lying calmly on his  bed, and so took courage to enter.
    Fast asleep.
  No passion in the face, no avarice, no anxiety, no wild  desire; all gentle, tranquil, and at peace.
  This was not the gambler,  or the shadow in her room; this was not even the worn and jaded man  whose face had so often met her own in the grey morning light; this was  her dear old friend, her harmless fellow-traveller, her good, kind  grandfather.
    She had no fear as she looked upon his slumbering features, but she had  a deep and weighty sorrow, and it found its relief in tears.
    'God bless him!' said the child, stooping softly to kiss his placid  cheek.
  'I see too well now, that they would indeed part us if they  found us out, and shut him up from the light of the sun and sky.
  He  has only me to help him.
  God bless us both!'    Lighting her candle, she retreated as silently as she had come, and,  gaining her own room once more, sat up during the remainder of that  long, long, miserable night.
    At last the day turned her waning candle pale, and she fell asleep.
  She was quickly roused by the girl who had shown her up to bed; and, as  soon as she was dressed, prepared to go down to her grandfather.
  But  first she searched her pocket and found that her money was all  gone--not a sixpence remained.
    The old man was ready, and in a few seconds they were on their road.
  The child thought he rather avoided her eye, and appeared to expect  that she would tell him of her loss.
  She felt she must do that, or he  might suspect the truth.
    'Grandfather,' she said in a tremulous voice, after they had walked  about a mile in silence, 'do you think they are honest people at the  house yonder?'    'Why?' returned the old man trembling.
  'Do I think them honest--yes,  they played honestly.
'    'I'll tell you why I ask,' rejoined Nell.
  'I lost some money last  night--out of my bedroom, I am sure.
  Unless it was taken by somebody  in jest--only in jest, dear grandfather, which would make me laugh  heartily if I could but know it--'    'Who would take money in jest?' returned the old man in a hurried  manner.
  'Those who take money, take it to keep.
  Don't talk of jest.
'    'Then it was stolen out of my room, dear,' said the child, whose last  hope was destroyed by the manner of this reply.
    'But is there no more, Nell?' said the old man; 'no more anywhere?  Was  it all taken--every farthing of it--was there nothing left?'    'Nothing,' replied the child.
    'We must get more,' said the old man, 'we must earn it, Nell, hoard it  up, scrape it together, come by it somehow.
  Never mind this loss.
  Tell nobody of it, and perhaps we may regain it.
  Don't ask how;--we  may regain it, and a great deal more;--but tell nobody, or trouble may  come of it.
  And so they took it out of thy room, when thou wert  asleep!' he added in a compassionate tone, very different from the  secret, cunning way in which he had spoken until now.
  'Poor Nell, poor  little Nell!'    The child hung down her head and wept.
  The sympathising tone in which  he spoke, was quite sincere; she was sure of that.
  It was not the  lightest part of her sorrow to know that this was done for her.
    'Not a word about it to any one but me,' said the old man, 'no, not  even to me,' he added hastily, 'for it can do no good.
  All the losses  that ever were, are not worth tears from thy eyes, darling.
  Why should  they be, when we will win them back?'    'Let them go,' said the child looking up.
  'Let them go, once and for  ever, and I would never shed another tear if every penny had been a  thousand pounds.
'    'Well, well,' returned the old man, checking himself as some impetuous  answer rose to his lips, 'she knows no better.
  I ought to be thankful  of it.
'    'But listen to me,' said the child earnestly, 'will you listen to me?'    'Aye, aye, I'll listen,' returned the old man, still without looking at  her; 'a pretty voice.
  It has always a sweet sound to me.
  It always  had when it was her mother's, poor child.
'    'Let me persuade you, then--oh, do let me persuade you,' said the  child, 'to think no more of gains or losses, and to try no fortune but  the fortune we pursue together.
'    'We pursue this aim together,' retorted her grandfather, still looking  away and seeming to confer with himself.
  'Whose image sanctifies the  game?'    'Have we been worse off,' resumed the child, 'since you forgot these  cares, and we have been travelling on together?  Have we not been much  better and happier without a home to shelter us, than ever we were in  that unhappy house, when they were on your mind?'    'She speaks the truth,' murmured the old man in the same tone as  before.
  'It must not turn me, but it is the truth; no doubt it is.
'    'Only remember what we have been since that bright morning when we  turned our backs upon it for the last time,' said Nell, 'only remember  what we have been since we have been free of all those miseries--what  peaceful days and quiet nights we have had--what pleasant times we have  known--what happiness we have enjoyed.
  If we have been tired or  hungry, we have been soon refreshed, and slept the sounder for it.
  Think what beautiful things we have seen, and how contented we have  felt.
  And why was this blessed change?'    He stopped her with a motion of his hand, and bade her talk to him no  more just then, for he was busy.
  After a time he kissed her cheek,  still motioning her to silence, and walked on, looking far before him,  and sometimes stopping and gazing with a puckered brow upon the ground,  as if he were painfully trying to collect his disordered thoughts.
  Once she saw tears in his eyes.
  When he had gone on thus for some  time, he took her hand in his as he was accustomed to do, with nothing  of the violence or animation of his late manner; and so, by degrees so  fine that the child could not trace them, he settled down into his  usual quiet way, and suffered her to lead him where she would.
    When they presented themselves in the midst of the stupendous  collection, they found, as Nell had anticipated, that Mrs Jarley was  not yet out of bed, and that, although she had suffered some uneasiness  on their account overnight, and had indeed sat up for them until past  eleven o'clock, she had retired in the persuasion, that, being  overtaken by storm at some distance from home, they had sought the  nearest shelter, and would not return before morning.
  Nell immediately  applied herself with great assiduity to the decoration and preparation  of the room, and had the satisfaction of completing her task, and  dressing herself neatly, before the beloved of the Royal Family came  down to breakfast.
    'We haven't had,' said Mrs Jarley when the meal was over, 'more than  eight of Miss Monflathers's young ladies all the time we've been here,  and there's twenty-six of 'em, as I was told by the cook when I asked  her a question or two and put her on the free-list.
  We must try 'em  with a parcel of new bills, and you shall take it, my dear, and see  what effect that has upon 'em.
'    The proposed expedition being one of paramount importance, Mrs Jarley  adjusted Nell's bonnet with her own hands, and declaring that she  certainly did look very pretty, and reflected credit on the  establishment, dismissed her with many commendations, and certain  needful directions as to the turnings on the right which she was to  take, and the turnings on the left which she was to avoid.
  Thus  instructed, Nell had no difficulty in finding out Miss Monflathers's  Boarding and Day Establishment, which was a large house, with a high  wall, and a large garden-gate with a large brass plate, and a small  grating through which Miss Monflathers's parlour-maid inspected all  visitors before admitting them; for nothing in the shape of a man--no,  not even a milkman--was suffered, without special license, to pass that  gate.
  Even the tax-gatherer, who was stout, and wore spectacles and a  broad-brimmed hat, had the taxes handed through the grating.
  More  obdurate than gate of adamant or brass, this gate of Miss Monflathers's  frowned on all mankind.
  The very butcher respected it as a gate of  mystery, and left off whistling when he rang the bell.
    As Nell approached the awful door, it turned slowly upon its hinges  with a creaking noise, and, forth from the solemn grove beyond, came a  long file of young ladies, two and two, all with open books in their  hands, and some with parasols likewise.
  And last of the goodly  procession came Miss Monflathers, bearing herself a parasol of lilac  silk, and supported by two smiling teachers, each mortally envious of  the other, and devoted unto Miss Monflathers.
    Confused by the looks and whispers of the girls, Nell stood with  downcast eyes and suffered the procession to pass on, until Miss  Monflathers, bringing up the rear, approached her, when she curtseyed  and presented her little packet; on receipt whereof Miss Monflathers  commanded that the line should halt.
    'You're the wax-work child, are you not?' said Miss Monflathers.
    'Yes, ma'am,' replied Nell, colouring deeply, for the young ladies had  collected about her, and she was the centre on which all eyes were  fixed.
    'And don't you think you must be a very wicked little child,' said Miss  Monflathers, who was of rather uncertain temper, and lost no  opportunity of impressing moral truths upon the tender minds of the  young ladies, 'to be a wax-work child at all?'    Poor Nell had never viewed her position in this light, and not knowing  what to say, remained silent, blushing more deeply than before.
    'Don't you know,' said Miss Monflathers, 'that it's very naughty and  unfeminine, and a perversion of the properties wisely and benignantly  transmitted to us, with expansive powers to be roused from their  dormant state through the medium of cultivation?'    The two teachers murmured their respectful approval of this  home-thrust, and looked at Nell as though they would have said that  there indeed Miss Monflathers had hit her very hard.
  Then they smiled  and glanced at Miss Monflathers, and then, their eyes meeting, they  exchanged looks which plainly said that each considered herself smiler  in ordinary to Miss Monflathers, and regarded the other as having no  right to smile, and that her so doing was an act of presumption and  impertinence.
    'Don't you feel how naughty it is of you,' resumed Miss Monflathers,  'to be a wax-work child, when you might have the proud consciousness of  assisting, to the extent of your infant powers, the manufactures of  your country; of improving your mind by the constant contemplation of  the steam-engine; and of earning a comfortable and independent  subsistence of from two-and-ninepence to three shillings per week?  Don't you know that the harder you are at work, the happier you are?'    '"How doth the little--"' murmured one of the teachers, in quotation  from Doctor Watts.
    'Eh?' said Miss Monflathers, turning smartly round.
  'Who said that?'    Of course the teacher who had not said it, indicated the rival who had,  whom Miss Monflathers frowningly requested to hold her peace; by that  means throwing the informing teacher into raptures of joy.
    'The little busy bee,' said Miss Monflathers, drawing herself up, 'is  applicable only to genteel children.
      "In books, or work, or healthful play"    is quite right as far as they are concerned; and the work means  painting on velvet, fancy needle-work, or embroidery.
  In such cases as  these,' pointing to Nell, with her parasol, 'and in the case of all  poor people's children, we should read it thus:        "In work, work, work.
  In work alway    Let my first years be past,    That I may give for ev'ry day    Some good account at last.
"'      A deep hum of applause rose not only from the two teachers, but from  all the pupils, who were equally astonished to hear Miss Monflathers  improvising after this brilliant style; for although she had been long  known as a politician, she had never appeared before as an original  poet.
  Just then somebody happened to discover that Nell was crying,  and all eyes were again turned towards her.
    There were indeed tears in her eyes, and drawing out her handkerchief  to brush them away, she happened to let it fall.
  Before she could  stoop to pick it up, one young lady of about fifteen or sixteen, who  had been standing a little apart from the others, as though she had no  recognised place among them, sprang forward and put it in her hand.
  She was gliding timidly away again, when she was arrested by the  governess.
    'It was Miss Edwards who did that, I KNOW,' said Miss Monflathers  predictively.
  'Now I am sure that was Miss Edwards.
'    It was Miss Edwards, and everybody said it was Miss Edwards, and Miss  Edwards herself admitted that it was.
    'Is it not,' said Miss Monflathers, putting down her parasol to take a  severer view of the offender, 'a most remarkable thing, Miss Edwards,  that you have an attachment to the lower classes which always draws you  to their sides; or, rather, is it not a most extraordinary thing that  all I say and do will not wean you from propensities which your  original station in life have unhappily rendered habitual to you, you  extremely vulgar-minded girl?'    'I really intended no harm, ma'am,' said a sweet voice.
  'It was a  momentary impulse, indeed.
'    'An impulse!' repeated Miss Monflathers scornfully.
  'I wonder that you  presume to speak of impulses to me'--both the teachers assented--'I am  astonished'--both the teachers were astonished--'I suppose it is an  impulse which induces you to take the part of every grovelling and  debased person that comes in your way'--both the teachers supposed so  too.
    'But I would have you know, Miss Edwards,' resumed the governess in a  tone of increased severity, 'that you cannot be permitted--if it be  only for the sake of preserving a proper example and decorum in this  establishment--that you cannot be permitted, and that you shall not be  permitted, to fly in the face of your superiors in this exceedingly  gross manner.
  If you have no reason to feel a becoming pride before  wax-work children, there are young ladies here who have, and you must  either defer to those young ladies or leave the establishment, Miss  Edwards.
'    This young lady, being motherless and poor, was apprenticed at the  school--taught for nothing--teaching others what she learnt, for  nothing--boarded for nothing--lodged for nothing--and set down and  rated as something immeasurably less than nothing, by all the dwellers  in the house.
  The servant-maids felt her inferiority, for they were  better treated; free to come and go, and regarded in their stations  with much more respect.
  The teachers were infinitely superior, for  they had paid to go to school in their time, and were paid now.
  The  pupils cared little for a companion who had no grand stories to tell  about home; no friends to come with post-horses, and be received in all  humility, with cake and wine, by the governess; no deferential servant  to attend and bear her home for the holidays; nothing genteel to talk  about, and nothing to display.
  But why was Miss Monflathers always  vexed and irritated with the poor apprentice--how did that come to pass?    Why, the gayest feather in Miss Monflathers's cap, and the brightest  glory of Miss Monflathers's school, was a baronet's daughter--the real  live daughter of a real live baronet--who, by some extraordinary  reversal of the Laws of Nature, was not only plain in features but dull  in intellect, while the poor apprentice had both a ready wit, and a  handsome face and figure.
  It seems incredible.
  Here was Miss Edwards,  who only paid a small premium which had been spent long ago, every day  outshining and excelling the baronet's daughter, who learned all the  extras (or was taught them all) and whose half-yearly bill came to  double that of any other young lady's in the school, making no account  of the honour and reputation of her pupilage.
  Therefore, and because  she was a dependent, Miss Monflathers had a great dislike to Miss  Edwards, and was spiteful to her, and aggravated by her, and, when she  had compassion on little Nell, verbally fell upon and maltreated her as  we have already seen.
    'You will not take the air to-day, Miss Edwards,' said Miss  Monflathers.
  'Have the goodness to retire to your own room, and not to  leave it without permission.
'    The poor girl was moving hastily away, when she was suddenly, in  nautical phrase, 'brought to' by a subdued shriek from Miss Monflathers.
    'She has passed me without any salute!' cried the governess, raising  her eyes to the sky.
  'She has actually passed me without the slightest  acknowledgment of my presence!'    The young lady turned and curtsied.
  Nell could see that she raised her  dark eyes to the face of her superior, and that their expression, and  that of her whole attitude for the instant, was one of mute but most  touching appeal against this ungenerous usage.
  Miss Monflathers only  tossed her head in reply, and the great gate closed upon a bursting  heart.
    'As for you, you wicked child,' said Miss Monflathers, turning to Nell,  'tell your mistress that if she presumes to take the liberty of sending  to me any more, I will write to the legislative authorities and have  her put in the stocks, or compelled to do penance in a white sheet; and  you may depend upon it that you shall certainly experience the  treadmill if you dare to come here again.
  Now ladies, on.
'    The procession filed off, two and two, with the books and parasols, and  Miss Monflathers, calling the Baronet's daughter to walk with her and  smooth her ruffled feelings, discarded the two teachers--who by this  time had exchanged their smiles for looks of sympathy--and left them  to bring up the rear, and hate each other a little more for being  obliged to walk together.
              Mrs Jarley's wrath on first learning that she had been threatened with  the indignity of Stocks and Penance, passed all description.
  The  genuine and only Jarley exposed to public scorn, jeered by children,  and flouted by beadles!  The delight of the Nobility and Gentry shorn  of a bonnet which a Lady Mayoress might have sighed to wear, and  arrayed in a white sheet as a spectacle of mortification and humility!  And Miss Monflathers, the audacious creature who presumed, even in the  dimmest and remotest distance of her imagination, to conjure up the  degrading picture, 'I am a'most inclined,' said Mrs Jarley, bursting  with the fulness of her anger and the weakness of her means of revenge,  'to turn atheist when I think of it!'    But instead of adopting this course of retaliation, Mrs Jarley, on  second thoughts, brought out the suspicious bottle, and ordering  glasses to be set forth upon her favourite drum, and sinking into a  chair behind it, called her satellites about her, and to them several  times recounted, word for word, the affronts she had received.
  This  done, she begged them in a kind of deep despair to drink; then laughed,  then cried, then took a little sip herself, then laughed and cried  again, and took a little more; and so, by degrees, the worthy lady went  on, increasing in smiles and decreasing in tears, until at last she  could not laugh enough at Miss Monflathers, who, from being an object  of dire vexation, became one of sheer ridicule and absurdity.
    'For which of us is best off, I wonder,' quoth Mrs Jarley, 'she or me!  It's only talking, when all is said and done, and if she talks of me in  the stocks, why I can talk of her in the stocks, which is a good deal  funnier if we come to that.
  Lord, what does it matter, after all!'    Having arrived at this comfortable frame of mind (to which she had been  greatly assisted by certain short interjectional remarks of the  philosophical George), Mrs Jarley consoled Nell with many kind words,  and requested as a personal favour that whenever she thought of Miss  Monflathers, she would do nothing else but laugh at her, all the days  of her life.
    So ended Mrs Jarley's wrath, which subsided long before the going down  of the sun.
  Nell's anxieties, however, were of a deeper kind, and the  checks they imposed upon her cheerfulness were not so easily removed.
    That evening, as she had dreaded, her grandfather stole away, and did  not come back until the night was far spent.
  Worn out as she was, and  fatigued in mind and body, she sat up alone, counting the minutes,  until he returned--penniless, broken-spirited, and wretched, but still  hotly bent upon his infatuation.
    'Get me money,' he said wildly, as they parted for the night.
  'I must  have money, Nell.
  It shall be paid thee back with gallant interest one  day, but all the money that comes into thy hands, must be mine--not for  myself, but to use for thee.
  Remember, Nell, to use for thee!'    What could the child do with the knowledge she had, but give him every  penny that came into her hands, lest he should be tempted on to rob  their benefactress?  If she told the truth (so thought the child) he  would be treated as a madman; if she did not supply him with money, he  would supply himself; supplying him, she fed the fire that burnt him  up, and put him perhaps beyond recovery.
  Distracted by these thoughts,  borne down by the weight of the sorrow which she dared not tell,  tortured by a crowd of apprehensions whenever the old man was absent,  and dreading alike his stay and his return, the colour forsook her  cheek, her eye grew dim, and her heart was oppressed and heavy.
  All  her old sorrows had come back upon her, augmented by new fears and  doubts; by day they were ever present to her mind; by night they  hovered round her pillow, and haunted her in dreams.
    It was natural that, in the midst of her affliction, she should often  revert to that sweet young lady of whom she had only caught a hasty  glance, but whose sympathy, expressed in one slight brief action, dwelt  in her memory like the kindnesses of years.
  She would often think, if  she had such a friend as that to whom to tell her griefs, how much  lighter her heart would be--that if she were but free to hear that  voice, she would be happier.
  Then she would wish that she were  something better, that she were not quite so poor and humble, that she  dared address her without fearing a repulse; and then feel that there  was an immeasurable distance between them, and have no hope that the  young lady thought of her any more.
    It was now holiday-time at the schools, and the young ladies had gone  home, and Miss Monflathers was reported to be flourishing in London,  and damaging the hearts of middle-aged gentlemen, but nobody said  anything about Miss Edwards, whether she had gone home, or whether she  had any home to go to, whether she was still at the school, or anything  about her.
  But one evening, as Nell was returning from a lonely walk,  she happened to pass the inn where the stage-coaches stopped, just as  one drove up, and there was the beautiful girl she so well remembered,  pressing forward to embrace a young child whom they were helping down  from the roof.
    Well, this was her sister, her little sister, much younger than Nell,  whom she had not seen (so the story went afterwards) for five years,  and to bring whom to that place on a short visit, she had been saving  her poor means all that time.
  Nell felt as if her heart would break  when she saw them meet.
  They went a little apart from the knot of  people who had congregated about the coach, and fell upon each other's  neck, and sobbed, and wept with joy.
  Their plain and simple dress, the  distance which the child had come alone, their agitation and delight,  and the tears they shed, would have told their history by themselves.
    They became a little more composed in a short time, and went away, not  so much hand in hand as clinging to each other.
  'Are you sure you're  happy, sister?' said the child as they passed where Nell was standing.
  'Quite happy now,' she answered.
  'But always?' said the child.
  'Ah,  sister, why do you turn away your face?'    Nell could not help following at a little distance.
  They went to the  house of an old nurse, where the elder sister had engaged a bed-room  for the child.
  'I shall come to you early every morning,' she said,  'and we can be together all the day.
'    'Why not at night-time too? Dear sister, would they be angry with you  for that?'    Why were the eyes of little Nell wet, that night, with tears like those  of the two sisters?  Why did she bear a grateful heart because they had  met, and feel it pain to think that they would shortly part?  Let us  not believe that any selfish reference--unconscious though it might  have been--to her own trials awoke this sympathy, but thank God that  the innocent joys of others can strongly move us, and that we, even in  our fallen nature, have one source of pure emotion which must be prized  in Heaven!    By morning's cheerful glow, but oftener still by evening's gentle  light, the child, with a respect for the short and happy intercourse of  these two sisters which forbade her to approach and say a thankful  word, although she yearned to do so, followed them at a distance in  their walks and rambles, stopping when they stopped, sitting on the  grass when they sat down, rising when they went on, and feeling it a  companionship and delight to be so near them.
  Their evening walk was  by a river's side.
  Here, every night, the child was too, unseen by  them, unthought of, unregarded; but feeling as if they were her  friends, as if they had confidences and trusts together, as if her load  were lightened and less hard to bear; as if they mingled their sorrows,  and found mutual consolation.
  It was a weak fancy perhaps, the  childish fancy of a young and lonely creature; but night after night,  and still the sisters loitered in the same place, and still the child  followed with a mild and softened heart.
    She was much startled, on returning home one night, to find that Mrs  Jarley had commanded an announcement to be prepared, to the effect that  the stupendous collection would only remain in its present quarters one  day longer; in fulfilment of which threat (for all announcements  connected with public amusements are well known to be irrevocable and  most exact), the stupendous collection shut up next day.
    'Are we going from this place directly, ma'am?' said Nell.
    'Look here, child,' returned Mrs Jarley.
  'That'll inform you.
' And so  saying Mrs Jarley produced another announcement, wherein it was stated,  that, in consequence of numerous inquiries at the wax-work door, and in  consequence of crowds having been disappointed in obtaining admission,  the Exhibition would be continued for one week longer, and would  re-open next day.
    'For now that the schools are gone, and the regular sight-seers  exhausted,' said Mrs Jarley, 'we come to the General Public, and they  want stimulating.
'    Upon the following day at noon, Mrs Jarley established herself behind  the highly-ornamented table, attended by the distinguished effigies  before mentioned, and ordered the doors to be thrown open for the  readmission of a discerning and enlightened public.
  But the first  day's operations were by no means of a successful character, inasmuch  as the general public, though they manifested a lively interest in Mrs  Jarley personally, and such of her waxen satellites as were to be seen  for nothing, were not affected by any impulses moving them to the  payment of sixpence a head.
  Thus, notwithstanding that a great many  people continued to stare at the entry and the figures therein  displayed; and remained there with great perseverance, by the hour at a  time, to hear the barrel-organ played and to read the bills; and  notwithstanding that they were kind enough to recommend their friends  to patronise the exhibition in the like manner, until the door-way was  regularly blockaded by half the population of the town, who, when they  went off duty, were relieved by the other half; it was not found that  the treasury was any the richer, or that the prospects of the  establishment were at all encouraging.
    In this depressed state of the classical market, Mrs Jarley made  extraordinary efforts to stimulate the popular taste, and whet the  popular curiosity.
  Certain machinery in the body of the nun on the  leads over the door was cleaned up and put in motion, so that the  figure shook its head paralytically all day long, to the great  admiration of a drunken, but very Protestant, barber over the way, who  looked upon the said paralytic motion as typical of the degrading  effect wrought upon the human mind by the ceremonies of the Romish  Church and discoursed upon that theme with great eloquence and  morality.
  The two carters constantly passed in and out of the  exhibition-room, under various disguises, protesting aloud that the  sight was better worth the money than anything they had beheld in all  their lives, and urging the bystanders, with tears in their eyes, not  to neglect such a brilliant gratification.
  Mrs Jarley sat in the  pay-place, chinking silver moneys from noon till night, and solemnly  calling upon the crowd to take notice that the price of admission was  only sixpence, and that the departure of the whole collection, on a  short tour among the Crowned Heads of Europe, was positively fixed for  that day week.
    'So be in time, be in time, be in time,' said Mrs Jarley at the close  of every such address.
  'Remember that this is Jarley's stupendous  collection of upwards of One Hundred Figures, and that it is the only  collection in the world; all others being imposters and deceptions.
  Be  in time, be in time, be in time!'              As the course of this tale requires that we should become acquainted,  somewhere hereabouts, with a few particulars connected with the  domestic economy of Mr Sampson Brass, and as a more convenient place  than the present is not likely to occur for that purpose, the historian  takes the friendly reader by the hand, and springing with him into the  air, and cleaving the same at a greater rate than ever Don Cleophas  Leandro Perez Zambullo and his familiar travelled through that pleasant  region in company, alights with him upon the pavement of Bevis Marks.
    The intrepid aeronauts alight before a small dark house, once the  residence of Mr Sampson Brass.
    In the parlour window of this little habitation, which is so close upon  the footway that the passenger who takes the wall brushes the dim glass  with his coat sleeve--much to its improvement, for it is very dirty--in  this parlour window in the days of its occupation by Sampson Brass,  there hung, all awry and slack, and discoloured by the sun, a curtain  of faded green, so threadbare from long service as by no means to  intercept the view of the little dark room, but rather to afford a  favourable medium through which to observe it accurately.
  There was  not much to look at.
  A rickety table, with spare bundles of papers,  yellow and ragged from long carriage in the pocket, ostentatiously  displayed upon its top; a couple of stools set face to face on opposite  sides of this crazy piece of furniture; a treacherous old chair by the  fire-place, whose withered arms had hugged full many a client and  helped to squeeze him dry; a second-hand wig box, used as a depository  for blank writs and declarations and other small forms of law, once the  sole contents of the head which belonged to the wig which belonged to  the box, as they were now of the box itself; two or three common books  of practice; a jar of ink, a pounce box, a stunted hearth-broom, a  carpet trodden to shreds but still clinging with the tightness of  desperation to its tacks--these, with the yellow wainscot of the walls,  the smoke-discoloured ceiling, the dust and cobwebs, were among the  most prominent decorations of the office of Mr Sampson Brass.
    But this was mere still-life, of no greater importance than the plate,  'BRASS, Solicitor,' upon the door, and the bill, 'First floor to let to  a single gentleman,' which was tied to the knocker.
  The office  commonly held two examples of animated nature, more to the purpose of  this history, and in whom it has a stronger interest and more  particular concern.
    Of these, one was Mr Brass himself, who has already appeared in these  pages.
  The other was his clerk, assistant, housekeeper, secretary,  confidential plotter, adviser, intriguer, and bill of cost increaser,  Miss Brass--a kind of amazon at common law, of whom it may be desirable  to offer a brief description.
    Miss Sally Brass, then, was a lady of thirty-five or thereabouts, of a  gaunt and bony figure, and a resolute bearing, which if it repressed  the softer emotions of love, and kept admirers at a distance, certainly  inspired a feeling akin to awe in the breasts of those male strangers  who had the happiness to approach her.
  In face she bore a striking  resemblance to her brother, Sampson--so exact, indeed, was the likeness  between them, that had it consorted with Miss Brass's maiden modesty  and gentle womanhood to have assumed her brother's clothes in a frolic  and sat down beside him, it would have been difficult for the oldest  friend of the family to determine which was Sampson and which Sally,  especially as the lady carried upon her upper lip certain reddish  demonstrations, which, if the imagination had been assisted by her  attire, might have been mistaken for a beard.
  These were, however, in  all probability, nothing more than eyelashes in a wrong place, as the  eyes of Miss Brass were quite free from any such natural  impertinencies.
  In complexion Miss Brass was sallow--rather a dirty  sallow, so to speak--but this hue was agreeably relieved by the healthy  glow which mantled in the extreme tip of her laughing nose.
  Her voice  was exceedingly impressive--deep and rich in quality, and, once heard,  not easily forgotten.
  Her usual dress was a green gown, in colour not  unlike the curtain of the office window, made tight to the figure, and  terminating at the throat, where it was fastened behind by a peculiarly  large and massive button.
  Feeling, no doubt, that simplicity and  plainness are the soul of elegance, Miss Brass wore no collar or  kerchief except upon her head, which was invariably ornamented with a  brown gauze scarf, like the wing of the fabled vampire, and which,  twisted into any form that happened to suggest itself, formed an easy  and graceful head-dress.
    Such was Miss Brass in person.
  In mind, she was of a strong and  vigorous turn, having from her earliest youth devoted herself with  uncommon ardour to the study of law; not wasting her speculations upon  its eagle flights, which are rare, but tracing it attentively through  all the slippery and eel-like crawlings in which it commonly pursues  its way.
  Nor had she, like many persons of great intellect, confined  herself to theory, or stopped short where practical usefulness begins;  inasmuch as she could ingross, fair-copy, fill up printed forms with  perfect accuracy, and, in short, transact any ordinary duty of the  office down to pouncing a skin of parchment or mending a pen.
  It is  difficult to understand how, possessed of these combined attractions,  she should remain Miss Brass; but whether she had steeled her heart  against mankind, or whether those who might have wooed and won her,  were deterred by fears that, being learned in the law, she might have  too near her fingers' ends those particular statutes which regulate  what are familiarly termed actions for breach, certain it is that she  was still in a state of celibacy, and still in daily occupation of her  old stool opposite to that of her brother Sampson.
  And equally certain  it is, by the way, that between these two stools a great many people  had come to the ground.
    One morning Mr Sampson Brass sat upon his stool copying some legal  process, and viciously digging his pen deep into the paper, as if he  were writing upon the very heart of the party against whom it was  directed; and Miss Sally Brass sat upon her stool making a new pen  preparatory to drawing out a little bill, which was her favourite  occupation; and so they sat in silence for a long time, until Miss  Brass broke silence.
    'Have you nearly done, Sammy?' said Miss Brass; for in her mild and  feminine lips, Sampson became Sammy, and all things were softened down.
    'No,' returned her brother.
  'It would have been all done though, if  you had helped at the right time.
'    'Oh yes, indeed,' cried Miss Sally; 'you want my help, don't you?--YOU,  too, that are going to keep a clerk!'    'Am I going to keep a clerk for my own pleasure, or because of my own  wish, you provoking rascal!' said Mr Brass, putting his pen in his  mouth, and grinning spitefully at his sister.
  'What do you taunt me  about going to keep a clerk for?'    It may be observed in this place, lest the fact of Mr Brass calling a  lady a rascal, should occasion any wonderment or surprise, that he was  so habituated to having her near him in a man's capacity, that he had  gradually accustomed himself to talk to her as though she were really a  man.
  And this feeling was so perfectly reciprocal, that not only did  Mr Brass often call Miss Brass a rascal, or even put an adjective  before the rascal, but Miss Brass looked upon it as quite a matter of  course, and was as little moved as any other lady would be by being  called an angel.
    'What do you taunt me, after three hours' talk last night, with going  to keep a clerk for?' repeated Mr Brass, grinning again with the pen in  his mouth, like some nobleman's or gentleman's crest.
  'Is it my fault?'    'All I know is,' said Miss Sally, smiling drily, for she delighted in  nothing so much as irritating her brother, 'that if every one of your  clients is to force us to keep a clerk, whether we want to or not, you  had better leave off business, strike yourself off the roll, and get  taken in execution, as soon as you can.
'    'Have we got any other client like him?' said Brass.
  'Have we got  another client like him now--will you answer me that?'    'Do you mean in the face!' said his sister.
    'Do I mean in the face!' sneered Sampson Brass, reaching over to take  up the bill-book, and fluttering its leaves rapidly.
  'Look  here--Daniel Quilp, Esquire--Daniel Quilp, Esquire--Daniel Quilp,  Esquire--all through.
  Whether should I take a clerk that he  recommends, and says, "this is the man for you," or lose all this, eh?'    Miss Sally deigned to make no reply, but smiled again, and went on with  her work.
    'But I know what it is,' resumed Brass after a short silence.
  'You're  afraid you won't have as long a finger in the business as you've been  used to have.
  Do you think I don't see through that?'    'The business wouldn't go on very long, I expect, without me,' returned  his sister composedly.
  'Don't you be a fool and provoke me, Sammy, but  mind what you're doing, and do it.
'    Sampson Brass, who was at heart in great fear of his sister, sulkily  bent over his writing again, and listened as she said:    'If I determined that the clerk ought not to come, of course he  wouldn't be allowed to come.
  You know that well enough, so don't talk  nonsense.
'    Mr Brass received this observation with increased meekness, merely  remarking, under his breath, that he didn't like that kind of joking,  and that Miss Sally would be 'a much better fellow' if she forbore to  aggravate him.
  To this compliment Miss Sally replied, that she had a  relish for the amusement, and had no intention to forego its  gratification.
  Mr Brass not caring, as it seemed, to pursue the  subject any further, they both plied their pens at a great pace, and  there the discussion ended.
    While they were thus employed, the window was suddenly darkened, as by  some person standing close against it.
  As Mr Brass and Miss Sally  looked up to ascertain the cause, the top sash was nimbly lowered from  without, and Quilp thrust in his head.
    'Hallo!' he said, standing on tip-toe on the window-sill, and looking  down into the room.
  'Is there anybody at home?  Is there any of the  Devil's ware here?  Is Brass at a premium, eh?'    'Ha, ha, ha!' laughed the lawyer in an affected ecstasy.
  'Oh, very  good, Sir!  Oh, very good indeed!  Quite eccentric!  Dear me, what  humour he has!'    'Is that my Sally?' croaked the dwarf, ogling the fair Miss Brass.
  'Is  it Justice with the bandage off her eyes, and without the sword and  scales?  Is it the Strong Arm of the Law?  Is it the Virgin of Bevis?'    'What an amazing flow of spirits!' cried Brass.
  'Upon my word, it's  quite extraordinary!'    'Open the door,' said Quilp, 'I've got him here.
  Such a clerk for you,  Brass, such a prize, such an ace of trumps.
  Be quick and open the  door, or if there's another lawyer near and he should happen to look  out of window, he'll snap him up before your eyes, he will.
'    It is probable that the loss of the phoenix of clerks, even to a rival  practitioner, would not have broken Mr Brass's heart; but, pretending  great alacrity, he rose from his seat, and going to the door, returned,  introducing his client, who led by the hand no less a person than Mr  Richard Swiveller.
    'There she is,' said Quilp, stopping short at the door, and wrinkling  up his eyebrows as he looked towards Miss Sally; 'there is the woman I  ought to have married--there is the beautiful Sarah--there is the  female who has all the charms of her sex and none of their weaknesses.
  Oh Sally, Sally!'    To this amorous address Miss Brass briefly responded 'Bother!'    'Hard-hearted as the metal from which she takes her name,' said Quilp.
  'Why don't she change it--melt down the brass, and take another name?'    'Hold your nonsense, Mr Quilp, do,' returned Miss Sally, with a grim  smile.
  'I wonder you're not ashamed of yourself before a strange young  man.
'    'The strange young man,' said Quilp, handing Dick Swiveller forward,  'is too susceptible himself not to understand me well.
  This is Mr  Swiveller, my intimate friend--a gentleman of good family and great  expectations, but who, having rather involved himself by youthful  indiscretion, is content for a time to fill the humble station of a  clerk--humble, but here most enviable.
  What a delicious atmosphere!'    If Mr Quilp spoke figuratively, and meant to imply that the air  breathed by Miss Sally Brass was sweetened and rarefied by that dainty  creature, he had doubtless good reason for what he said.
  But if he  spoke of the delights of the atmosphere of Mr Brass's office in a  literal sense, he had certainly a peculiar taste, as it was of a close  and earthy kind, and, besides being frequently impregnated with strong  whiffs of the second-hand wearing apparel exposed for sale in Duke's  Place and Houndsditch, had a decided flavour of rats and mice, and a  taint of mouldiness.
  Perhaps some doubts of its pure delight presented  themselves to Mr Swiveller, as he gave vent to one or two short abrupt  sniffs, and looked incredulously at the grinning dwarf.
    'Mr Swiveller,' said Quilp, 'being pretty well accustomed to the  agricultural pursuits of sowing wild oats, Miss Sally, prudently  considers that half a loaf is better than no bread.
  To be out of  harm's way he prudently thinks is something too, and therefore he  accepts your brother's offer.
  Brass, Mr Swiveller is yours.
'    'I am very glad, Sir,' said Mr Brass, 'very glad indeed.
  Mr Swiveller,  Sir, is fortunate enough to have your friendship.
  You may be very  proud, Sir, to have the friendship of Mr Quilp.
'    Dick murmured something about never wanting a friend or a bottle to  give him, and also gasped forth his favourite allusion to the wing of  friendship and its never moulting a feather; but his faculties appeared  to be absorbed in the contemplation of Miss Sally Brass, at whom he  stared with blank and rueful looks, which delighted the watchful dwarf  beyond measure.
  As to the divine Miss Sally herself, she rubbed her  hands as men of business do, and took a few turns up and down the  office with her pen behind her ear.
    'I suppose,' said the dwarf, turning briskly to his legal friend, 'that  Mr Swiveller enters upon his duties at once?  It's Monday morning.
'    'At once, if you please, Sir, by all means,' returned Brass.
    'Miss Sally will teach him law, the delightful study of the law,' said  Quilp; 'she'll be his guide, his friend, his companion, his Blackstone,  his Coke upon Littleton, his Young Lawyer's Best Companion.
'    'He is exceedingly eloquent,' said Brass, like a man abstracted, and  looking at the roofs of the opposite houses, with his hands in his  pockets; 'he has an extraordinary flow of language.
  Beautiful, really.
'    'With Miss Sally,' Quilp went on, 'and the beautiful fictions of the  law, his days will pass like minutes.
  Those charming creations of the  poet, John Doe and Richard Roe, when they first dawn upon him, will  open a new world for the enlargement of his mind and the improvement of  his heart.
'    'Oh, beautiful, beautiful!  Beau-ti-ful indeed!' cried Brass.
  'It's a  treat to hear him!'    'Where will Mr Swiveller sit?' said Quilp, looking round.
    'Why, we'll buy another stool, sir,' returned Brass.
  'We hadn't any  thoughts of having a gentleman with us, sir, until you were kind enough  to suggest it, and our accommodation's not extensive.
  We'll look about  for a second-hand stool, sir.
  In the meantime, if Mr Swiveller will  take my seat, and try his hand at a fair copy of this ejectment, as I  shall be out pretty well all the morning--'    'Walk with me,' said Quilp.
  'I have a word or two to say to you on  points of business.
  Can you spare the time?'    'Can I spare the time to walk with you, sir?  You're joking, sir,  you're joking with me,' replied the lawyer, putting on his hat.
  'I'm  ready, sir, quite ready.
  My time must be fully occupied indeed, sir,  not to leave me time to walk with you.
  It's not everybody, sir, who  has an opportunity of improving himself by the conversation of Mr  Quilp.
'    The dwarf glanced sarcastically at his brazen friend, and, with a short  dry cough, turned upon his heel to bid adieu to Miss Sally.
  After a  very gallant parting on his side, and a very cool and gentlemanly sort  of one on hers, he nodded to Dick Swiveller, and withdrew with the  attorney.
    Dick stood at the desk in a state of utter stupefaction, staring with  all his might at the beauteous Sally, as if she had been some curious  animal whose like had never lived.
  When the dwarf got into the street,  he mounted again upon the window-sill, and looked into the office for a  moment with a grinning face, as a man might peep into a cage.
  Dick  glanced upward at him, but without any token of recognition; and long  after he had disappeared, still stood gazing upon Miss Sally Brass,  seeing or thinking of nothing else, and rooted to the spot.
    Miss Brass being by this time deep in the bill of costs, took no notice  whatever of Dick, but went scratching on, with a noisy pen, scoring  down the figures with evident delight, and working like a steam-engine.
  There stood Dick, gazing now at the green gown, now at the brown  head-dress, now at the face, and now at the rapid pen, in a state of  stupid perplexity, wondering how he got into the company of that  strange monster, and whether it was a dream and he would ever wake.
  At  last he heaved a deep sigh, and began slowly pulling off his coat.
    Mr Swiveller pulled off his coat, and folded it up with great  elaboration, staring at Miss Sally all the time; then put on a blue  jacket with a double row of gilt buttons, which he had originally  ordered for aquatic expeditions, but had brought with him that morning  for office purposes; and, still keeping his eye upon her, suffered  himself to drop down silently upon Mr Brass's stool.
  Then he underwent  a relapse, and becoming powerless again, rested his chin upon his hand,  and opened his eyes so wide, that it appeared quite out of the question  that he could ever close them any more.
    When he had looked so long that he could see nothing, Dick took his  eyes off the fair object of his amazement, turned over the leaves of  the draft he was to copy, dipped his pen into the inkstand, and at  last, and by slow approaches, began to write.
  But he had not written  half-a-dozen words when, reaching over to the inkstand to take a fresh  dip, he happened to raise his eyes.
  There was the intolerable brown  head-dress--there was the green gown--there, in short, was Miss Sally  Brass, arrayed in all her charms, and more tremendous than ever.
    This happened so often, that Mr Swiveller by degrees began to feel  strange influences creeping over him--horrible desires to annihilate  this Sally Brass--mysterious promptings to knock her head-dress off and  try how she looked without it.
  There was a very large ruler on the  table; a large, black, shining ruler.
  Mr Swiveller took it up and  began to rub his nose with it.
    From rubbing his nose with the ruler, to poising it in his hand and  giving it an occasional flourish after the tomahawk manner, the  transition was easy and natural.
  In some of these flourishes it went  close to Miss Sally's head; the ragged edges of the head-dress  fluttered with the wind it raised; advance it but an inch, and that  great brown knot was on the ground: yet still the unconscious maiden  worked away, and never raised her eyes.
    Well, this was a great relief.
  It was a good thing to write doggedly  and obstinately until he was desperate, and then snatch up the ruler  and whirl it about the brown head-dress with the consciousness that he  could have it off if he liked.
  It was a good thing to draw it back,  and rub his nose very hard with it, if he thought Miss Sally was going  to look up, and to recompense himself with more hardy flourishes when  he found she was still absorbed.
  By these means Mr Swiveller calmed  the agitation of his feelings, until his applications to the ruler  became less fierce and frequent, and he could even write as many as  half-a-dozen consecutive lines without having recourse to it--which was  a great victory.
              In course of time, that is to say, after a couple of hours or so, of  diligent application, Miss Brass arrived at the conclusion of her task,  and recorded the fact by wiping her pen upon the green gown, and taking  a pinch of snuff from a little round tin box which she carried in her  pocket.
  Having disposed of this temperate refreshment, she arose from  her stool, tied her papers into a formal packet with red tape, and  taking them under her arm, marched out of the office.
    Mr Swiveller had scarcely sprung off his seat and commenced the  performance of a maniac hornpipe, when he was interrupted, in the  fulness of his joy at being again alone, by the opening of the door,  and the reappearance of Miss Sally's head.
    'I am going out,' said Miss Brass.
    'Very good, ma'am,' returned Dick.
  'And don't hurry yourself on my  account to come back, ma'am,' he added inwardly.
    'If anybody comes on office business, take their messages, and say that  the gentleman who attends to that matter isn't in at present, will  you?' said Miss Brass.
    'I will, ma'am,' replied Dick.
    'I shan't be very long,' said Miss Brass, retiring.
    'I'm sorry to hear it, ma'am,' rejoined Dick when she had shut the  door.
  'I hope you may be unexpectedly detained, ma'am.
  If you could  manage to be run over, ma'am, but not seriously, so much the better.
'    Uttering these expressions of good-will with extreme gravity, Mr  Swiveller sat down in the client's chair and pondered; then took a few  turns up and down the room and fell into the chair again.
    'So I'm Brass's clerk, am I?' said Dick.
  'Brass's clerk, eh?  And the  clerk of Brass's sister--clerk to a female Dragon.
  Very good, very  good!  What shall I be next?  Shall I be a convict in a felt hat and a  grey suit, trotting about a dockyard with my number neatly embroidered  on my uniform, and the order of the garter on my leg, restrained from  chafing my ankle by a twisted belcher handkerchief?  Shall I be that?  Will that do, or is it too genteel?  Whatever you please, have it your  own way, of course.
'    As he was entirely alone, it may be presumed that, in these remarks, Mr  Swiveller addressed himself to his fate or destiny, whom, as we learn  by the precedents, it is the custom of heroes to taunt in a very bitter  and ironical manner when they find themselves in situations of an  unpleasant nature.
  This is the more probable from the circumstance of  Mr Swiveller directing his observations to the ceiling, which these  bodily personages are usually supposed to inhabit--except in theatrical  cases, when they live in the heart of the great chandelier.
    'Quilp offers me this place, which he says he can insure me,' resumed  Dick after a thoughtful silence, and telling off the circumstances of  his position, one by one, upon his fingers; 'Fred, who, I could have  taken my affidavit, would not have heard of such a thing, backs Quilp  to my astonishment, and urges me to take it also--staggerer, number  one!  My aunt in the country stops the supplies, and writes an  affectionate note to say that she has made a new will, and left me out  of it--staggerer, number two.
  No money; no credit; no support from  Fred, who seems to turn steady all at once; notice to quit the old  lodgings--staggerers, three, four, five, and six!  Under an  accumulation of staggerers, no man can be considered a free agent.
  No  man knocks himself down; if his destiny knocks him down, his destiny  must pick him up again.
  Then I'm very glad that mine has brought all  this upon itself, and I shall be as careless as I can, and make myself  quite at home to spite it.
  So go on my buck,' said Mr Swiveller,  taking his leave of the ceiling with a significant nod, 'and let us see  which of us will be tired first!'    Dismissing the subject of his downfall with these reflections, which  were no doubt very profound, and are indeed not altogether unknown in  certain systems of moral philosophy, Mr Swiveller shook off his  despondency and assumed the cheerful ease of an irresponsible clerk.
    As a means towards his composure and self-possession, he entered into a  more minute examination of the office than he had yet had time to make;  looked into the wig-box, the books, and ink-bottle; untied and  inspected all the papers; carved a few devices on the table with a  sharp blade of Mr Brass's penknife; and wrote his name on the inside of  the wooden coal-scuttle.
  Having, as it were, taken formal possession  of his clerkship in virtue of these proceedings, he opened the window  and leaned negligently out of it until a beer-boy happened to pass,  whom he commanded to set down his tray and to serve him with a pint of  mild porter, which he drank upon the spot and promptly paid for, with  the view of breaking ground for a system of future credit and opening a  correspondence tending thereto, without loss of time.
  Then, three or  four little boys dropped in, on legal errands from three or four  attorneys of the Brass grade: whom Mr Swiveller received and dismissed  with about as professional a manner, and as correct and comprehensive  an understanding of their business, as would have been shown by a clown  in a pantomime under similar circumstances.
  These things done and  over, he got upon his stool again and tried his hand at drawing  caricatures of Miss Brass with a pen and ink, whistling very cheerfully  all the time.
    He was occupied in this diversion when a coach stopped near the door,  and presently afterwards there was a loud double-knock.
  As this was no  business of Mr Swiveller's, the person not ringing the office bell, he  pursued his diversion with perfect composure, notwithstanding that he  rather thought there was nobody else in the house.
    In this, however, he was mistaken; for, after the knock had been  repeated with increased impatience, the door was opened, and somebody  with a very heavy tread went up the stairs and into the room above.
  Mr  Swiveller was wondering whether this might be another Miss Brass, twin  sister to the Dragon, when there came a rapping of knuckles at the  office door.
    'Come in!' said Dick.
  'Don't stand upon ceremony.
  The business will  get rather complicated if I've many more customers.
  Come in!'    'Oh, please,' said a little voice very low down in the doorway, 'will  you come and show the lodgings?'    Dick leant over the table, and descried a small slipshod girl in a  dirty coarse apron and bib, which left nothing of her visible but her  face and feet.
  She might as well have been dressed in a violin-case.
    'Why, who are you?' said Dick.
    To which the only reply was, 'Oh, please will you come and show the  lodgings?'    There never was such an old-fashioned child in her looks and manner.
  She must have been at work from her cradle.
  She seemed as much afraid  of Dick, as Dick was amazed at her.
    'I hav'n't got anything to do with the lodgings,' said Dick.
  'Tell 'em  to call again.
'    'Oh, but please will you come and show the lodgings,' returned the  girl; 'It's eighteen shillings a week and us finding plate and linen.
  Boots and clothes is extra, and fires in winter-time is eightpence a  day.
'    'Why don't you show 'em yourself?  You seem to know all about 'em,'  said Dick.
    'Miss Sally said I wasn't to, because people wouldn't believe the  attendance was good if they saw how small I was first.
'    'Well, but they'll see how small you are afterwards, won't they?' said  Dick.
    'Ah!  But then they'll have taken 'em for a fortnight certain,' replied  the child with a shrewd look; 'and people don't like moving when  they're once settled.
'    'This is a queer sort of thing,' muttered Dick, rising.
  'What do you  mean to say you are--the cook?'    'Yes, I do plain cooking;' replied the child.
  'I'm housemaid too; I do  all the work of the house.
'    'I suppose Brass and the Dragon and I do the dirtiest part of it,'  thought Dick.
  And he might have thought much more, being in a doubtful  and hesitating mood, but that the girl again urged her request, and  certain mysterious bumping sounds on the passage and staircase seemed  to give note of the applicant's impatience.
  Richard Swiveller,  therefore, sticking a pen behind each ear, and carrying another in his  mouth as a token of his great importance and devotion to business,  hurried out to meet and treat with the single gentleman.
    He was a little surprised to perceive that the bumping sounds were  occasioned by the progress up-stairs of the single gentleman's trunk,  which, being nearly twice as wide as the staircase, and exceedingly  heavy withal, it was no easy matter for the united exertions of the  single gentleman and the coachman to convey up the steep ascent.
  But  there they were, crushing each other, and pushing and pulling with all  their might, and getting the trunk tight and fast in all kinds of  impossible angles, and to pass them was out of the question; for which  sufficient reason, Mr Swiveller followed slowly behind, entering a new  protest on every stair against the house of Mr Sampson Brass being thus  taken by storm.
    To these remonstrances, the single gentleman answered not a word, but  when the trunk was at last got into the bed-room, sat down upon it and  wiped his bald head and face with his handkerchief.
  He was very warm,  and well he might be; for, not to mention the exertion of getting the  trunk up stairs, he was closely muffled in winter garments, though the  thermometer had stood all day at eighty-one in the shade.
    'I believe, sir,' said Richard Swiveller, taking his pen out of his  mouth, 'that you desire to look at these apartments.
  They are very  charming apartments, sir.
  They command an uninterrupted view of--of  over the way, and they are within one minute's walk of--of the corner  of the street.
  There is exceedingly mild porter, sir, in the immediate  vicinity, and the contingent advantages are extraordinary.
'    'What's the rent?' said the single gentleman.
    'One pound per week,' replied Dick, improving on the terms.
    'I'll take 'em.
'    'The boots and clothes are extras,' said Dick; 'and the fires in winter  time are--'    'Are all agreed to,' answered the single gentleman.
    'Two weeks certain,' said Dick, 'are the--'    'Two weeks!' cried the single gentleman gruffly, eyeing him from top to  toe.
  'Two years.
  I shall live here for two years.
  Here.
  Ten pounds  down.
  The bargain's made.
'    'Why you see,' said Dick, 'my name is not Brass, and--'    'Who said it was?  My name's not Brass.
  What then?'    'The name of the master of the house is,' said Dick.
    'I'm glad of it,' returned the single gentleman; 'it's a good name for  a lawyer.
  Coachman, you may go.
  So may you, Sir.
'    Mr Swiveller was so much confounded by the single gentleman riding  roughshod over him at this rate, that he stood looking at him almost as  hard as he had looked at Miss Sally.
  The single gentleman, however,  was not in the slightest degree affected by this circumstance, but  proceeded with perfect composure to unwind the shawl which was tied  round his neck, and then to pull off his boots.
  Freed of these  encumbrances, he went on to divest himself of his other clothing, which  he folded up, piece by piece, and ranged in order on the trunk.
  Then,  he pulled down the window-blinds, drew the curtains, wound up his  watch, and, quite leisurely and methodically, got into bed.
    'Take down the bill,' were his parting words, as he looked out from  between the curtains; 'and let nobody call me till I ring the bell.
'    With that the curtains closed, and he seemed to snore immediately.
    'This is a most remarkable and supernatural sort of house!' said Mr  Swiveller, as he walked into the office with the bill in his hand.
  'She-dragons in the business, conducting themselves like professional  gentlemen; plain cooks of three feet high appearing mysteriously from  under ground; strangers walking in and going to bed without leave or  licence in the middle of the day!  If he should be one of the  miraculous fellows that turn up now and then, and has gone to sleep for  two years, I shall be in a pleasant situation.
  It's my destiny,  however, and I hope Brass may like it.
  I shall be sorry if he don't.
  But it's no business of mine--I have nothing whatever to do with it!'              Mr Brass on returning home received the report of his clerk with much  complacency and satisfaction, and was particular in inquiring after the  ten-pound note, which, proving on examination to be a good and lawful  note of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, increased his  good-humour considerably.
  Indeed he so overflowed with liberality and  condescension, that, in the fulness of his heart, he invited Mr  Swiveller to partake of a bowl of punch with him at that remote and  indefinite period which is currently denominated 'one of these days,'  and paid him many handsome compliments on the uncommon aptitude for  business which his conduct on the first day of his devotion to it had  so plainly evinced.
    It was a maxim with Mr Brass that the habit of paying compliments kept  a man's tongue oiled without any expense; and, as that useful member  ought never to grow rusty or creak in turning on its hinges in the case  of a practitioner of the law, in whom it should be always glib and  easy, he lost few opportunities of improving himself by the utterance  of handsome speeches and eulogistic expressions.
  And this had passed  into such a habit with him, that, if he could not be correctly said to  have his tongue at his fingers' ends, he might certainly be said to  have it anywhere but in his face: which being, as we have already seen,  of a harsh and repulsive character, was not oiled so easily, but  frowned above all the smooth speeches--one of nature's beacons, warning  off those who navigated the shoals and breakers of the World, or of  that dangerous strait the Law, and admonishing them to seek less  treacherous harbours and try their fortune elsewhere.
    While Mr Brass by turns overwhelmed his clerk with compliments and  inspected the ten-pound note, Miss Sally showed little emotion and that  of no pleasurable kind, for as the tendency of her legal practice had  been to fix her thoughts on small gains and gripings, and to whet and  sharpen her natural wisdom, she was not a little disappointed that the  single gentleman had obtained the lodgings at such an easy rate,  arguing that when he was seen to have set his mind upon them, he should  have been at the least charged double or treble the usual terms, and  that, in exact proportion as he pressed forward, Mr Swiveller should  have hung back.
  But neither the good opinion of Mr Brass, nor the  dissatisfaction of Miss Sally, wrought any impression upon that young  gentleman, who, throwing the responsibility of this and all other acts  and deeds thereafter to be done by him, upon his unlucky destiny, was  quite resigned and comfortable: fully prepared for the worst, and  philosophically indifferent to the best.
      'Good morning, Mr Richard,' said Brass, on the second day of Mr  Swiveller's clerkship.
  'Sally found you a second-hand stool, Sir,  yesterday evening, in Whitechapel.
  She's a rare fellow at a bargain, I  can tell you, Mr Richard.
  You'll find that a first-rate stool, Sir,  take my word for it.
'    'It's rather a crazy one to look at,' said Dick.
    'You'll find it a most amazing stool to sit down upon, you may depend,'  returned Mr Brass.
  'It was bought in the open street just opposite the  hospital, and as it has been standing there a month of two, it has got  rather dusty and a little brown from being in the sun, that's all.
'    'I hope it hasn't got any fevers or anything of that sort in it,' said  Dick, sitting himself down discontentedly, between Mr Sampson and the  chaste Sally.
  'One of the legs is longer than the others.
'    'Then we get a bit of timber in, Sir,' retorted Brass.
  'Ha, ha, ha!  We get a bit of timber in, Sir, and that's another advantage of my  sister's going to market for us.
  Miss Brass, Mr Richard is the--'    'Will you keep quiet?' interrupted the fair subject of these remarks,  looking up from her papers.
  'How am I to work if you keep on  chattering?'    'What an uncertain chap you are!' returned the lawyer.
  'Sometimes  you're all for a chat.
  At another time you're all for work.
  A man  never knows what humour he'll find you in.
'    'I'm in a working humour now,' said Sally, 'so don't disturb me, if you  please.
  And don't take him,' Miss Sally pointed with the feather of  her pen to Richard, 'off his business.
  He won't do more than he can  help, I dare say.
'    Mr Brass had evidently a strong inclination to make an angry reply, but  was deterred by prudent or timid considerations, as he only muttered  something about aggravation and a vagabond; not associating the terms  with any individual, but mentioning them as connected with some  abstract ideas which happened to occur to him.
  They went on writing  for a long time in silence after this--in such a dull silence that Mr  Swiveller (who required excitement) had several times fallen asleep,  and written divers strange words in an unknown character with his eyes  shut, when Miss Sally at length broke in upon the monotony of the  office by pulling out the little tin box, taking a noisy pinch of  snuff, and then expressing her opinion that Mr Richard Swiveller had  'done it.
'    'Done what, ma'am?' said Richard.
    'Do you know,' returned Miss Brass, 'that the lodger isn't up yet--  that nothing has been seen or heard of him since he went to bed  yesterday afternoon?'    'Well, ma'am,' said Dick, 'I suppose he may sleep his ten pound out, in  peace and quietness, if he likes.
'    'Ah!  I begin to think he'll never wake,' observed Miss Sally.
    'It's a very remarkable circumstance,' said Brass, laying down his pen;  'really, very remarkable.
  Mr Richard, you'll remember, if this  gentleman should be found to have hung himself to the bed-post, or any  unpleasant accident of that kind should happen--you'll remember, Mr  Richard, that this ten pound note was given to you in part payment of  two years' rent?  You'll bear that in mind, Mr Richard; you had better  make a note of it, sir, in case you should ever be called upon to give  evidence.
'    Mr Swiveller took a large sheet of foolscap, and with a countenance of  profound gravity, began to make a very small note in one corner.
    'We can never be too cautious,' said Mr Brass.
  'There is a deal of  wickedness going about the world, a deal of wickedness.
  Did the  gentleman happen to say, Sir--but never mind that at present, sir;  finish that little memorandum first.
'    Dick did so, and handed it to Mr Brass, who had dismounted from his  stool, and was walking up and down the office.
    'Oh, this is the memorandum, is it?' said Brass, running his eye over  the document.
  'Very good.
  Now, Mr Richard, did the gentleman say  anything else?'    'No.
'    'Are you sure, Mr Richard,' said Brass, solemnly, 'that the gentleman  said nothing else?'    'Devil a word, Sir,' replied Dick.
    'Think again, Sir,' said Brass; 'it's my duty, Sir, in the position in  which I stand, and as an honourable member of the legal profession--the  first profession in this country, Sir, or in any other country, or in  any of the planets that shine above us at night and are supposed to be  inhabited--it's my duty, Sir, as an honourable member of that  profession, not to put to you a leading question in a matter of this  delicacy and importance.
  Did the gentleman, Sir, who took the first  floor of you yesterday afternoon, and who brought with him a box of  property--a box of property--say anything more than is set down in this  memorandum?'    'Come, don't be a fool,' said Miss Sally.
    Dick looked at her, and then at Brass, and then at Miss Sally again,  and still said 'No.
'    'Pooh, pooh!  Deuce take it, Mr Richard, how dull you are!' cried  Brass, relaxing into a smile.
  'Did he say anything about his  property?--there!'    'That's the way to put it,' said Miss Sally, nodding to her brother.
    'Did he say, for instance,' added Brass, in a kind of comfortable, cozy  tone--'I don't assert that he did say so, mind; I only ask you, to  refresh your memory--did he say, for instance, that he was a stranger  in London--that it was not his humour or within his ability to give any  references--that he felt we had a right to require them--and that, in  case anything should happen to him, at any time, he particularly  desired that whatever property he had upon the premises should be  considered mine, as some slight recompense for the trouble and  annoyance I should sustain--and were you, in short,' added Brass, still  more comfortably and cozily than before, 'were you induced to accept  him on my behalf, as a tenant, upon those conditions?'    'Certainly not,' replied Dick.
    'Why then, Mr Richard,' said Brass, darting at him a supercilious and  reproachful look, 'it's my opinion that you've mistaken your calling,  and will never make a lawyer.
'    'Not if you live a thousand years,' added Miss Sally.
  Whereupon the  brother and sister took each a noisy pinch of snuff from the little tin  box, and fell into a gloomy thoughtfulness.
    Nothing further passed up to Mr Swiveller's dinner-time, which was at  three o'clock, and seemed about three weeks in coming.
  At the first  stroke of the hour, the new clerk disappeared.
  At the last stroke of  five, he reappeared, and the office, as if by magic, became fragrant  with the smell of gin and water and lemon-peel.
    'Mr Richard,' said Brass, 'this man's not up yet.
  Nothing will wake  him, sir.
  What's to be done?'    'I should let him have his sleep out,' returned Dick.
    'Sleep out!' cried Brass; 'why he has been asleep now, six-and-twenty  hours.
  We have been moving chests of drawers over his head, we have  knocked double knocks at the street-door, we have made the servant-girl  fall down stairs several times (she's a light weight, and it don't hurt  her much,) but nothing wakes him.
'    'Perhaps a ladder,' suggested Dick, 'and getting in at the first-floor  window--'    'But then there's a door between; besides, the neighbours would be up  in arms,' said Brass.
    'What do you say to getting on the roof of the house through the  trap-door, and dropping down the chimney?' suggested Dick.
    'That would be an excellent plan,' said Brass, 'if anybody would be--'  and here he looked very hard at Mr Swiveller--'would be kind, and  friendly, and generous enough, to undertake it.
  I dare say it would  not be anything like as disagreeable as one supposes.
'    Dick had made the suggestion, thinking that the duty might possibly  fall within Miss Sally's department.
  As he said nothing further, and  declined taking the hint, Mr Brass was fain to propose that they should  go up stairs together, and make a last effort to awaken the sleeper by  some less violent means, which, if they failed on this last trial, must  positively be succeeded by stronger measures.
  Mr Swiveller, assenting,  armed himself with his stool and the large ruler, and repaired with his  employer to the scene of action, where Miss Brass was already ringing a  hand-bell with all her might, and yet without producing the smallest  effect upon their mysterious lodger.
    'There are his boots, Mr Richard!' said Brass.
    'Very obstinate-looking articles they are too,' quoth Richard  Swiveller.
  And truly, they were as sturdy and bluff a pair of boots as  one would wish to see; as firmly planted on the ground as if their  owner's legs and feet had been in them; and seeming, with their broad  soles and blunt toes, to hold possession of their place by main force.
    'I can't see anything but the curtain of the bed,' said Brass, applying  his eye to the keyhole of the door.
  'Is he a strong man, Mr Richard?'    'Very,' answered Dick.
    'It would be an extremely unpleasant circumstance if he was to bounce  out suddenly,' said Brass.
  'Keep the stairs clear.
  I should be more  than a match for him, of course, but I'm the master of the house, and  the laws of hospitality must be respected.
--Hallo there!  Hallo, hallo!'    While Mr Brass, with his eye curiously twisted into the keyhole,  uttered these sounds as a means of attracting the lodger's attention,  and while Miss Brass plied the hand-bell, Mr Swiveller put his stool  close against the wall by the side of the door, and mounting on the top  and standing bolt upright, so that if the lodger did make a rush, he  would most probably pass him in its onward fury, began a violent  battery with the ruler upon the upper panels of the door.
  Captivated  with his own ingenuity, and confident in the strength of his position,  which he had taken up after the method of those hardy individuals who  open the pit and gallery doors of theatres on crowded nights, Mr  Swiveller rained down such a shower of blows, that the noise of the  bell was drowned; and the small servant, who lingered on the stairs  below, ready to fly at a moment's notice, was obliged to hold her ears  lest she should be rendered deaf for life.
    Suddenly the door was unlocked on the inside, and flung violently open.
  The small servant flew to the coal-cellar; Miss Sally dived into her  own bed-room; Mr Brass, who was not remarkable for personal courage,  ran into the next street, and finding that nobody followed him, armed  with a poker or other offensive weapon, put his hands in his pockets,  walked very slowly all at once, and whistled.
    Meanwhile, Mr Swiveller, on the top of the stool, drew himself into as  flat a shape as possible against the wall, and looked, not  unconcernedly, down upon the single gentleman, who appeared at the door  growling and cursing in a very awful manner, and, with the boots in his  hand, seemed to have an intention of hurling them down stairs on  speculation.
  This idea, however, he abandoned.
  He was turning into  his room again, still growling vengefully, when his eyes met those of  the watchful Richard.
    'Have YOU been making that horrible noise?' said the single gentleman.
    'I have been helping, sir,' returned Dick, keeping his eye upon him,  and waving the ruler gently in his right hand, as an indication of what  the single gentleman had to expect if he attempted any violence.
    'How dare you then,' said the lodger, 'Eh?'    To this, Dick made no other reply than by inquiring whether the lodger  held it to be consistent with the conduct and character of a gentleman  to go to sleep for six-and-twenty hours at a stretch, and whether the  peace of an amiable and virtuous family was to weigh as nothing in the  balance.
    'Is my peace nothing?' said the single gentleman.
    'Is their peace nothing, sir?' returned Dick.
  'I don't wish to hold  out any threats, sir--indeed the law does not allow of threats, for to  threaten is an indictable offence--but if ever you do that again, take  care you're not sat upon by the coroner and buried in a cross road  before you wake.
  We have been distracted with fears that you were  dead, Sir,' said Dick, gently sliding to the ground, 'and the short and  the long of it is, that we cannot allow single gentlemen to come into  this establishment and sleep like double gentlemen without paying extra  for it.
'    'Indeed!' cried the lodger.
    'Yes, Sir, indeed,' returned Dick, yielding to his destiny and saying  whatever came uppermost; 'an equal quantity of slumber was never got  out of one bed and bedstead, and if you're going to sleep in that way,  you must pay for a double-bedded room.
'    Instead of being thrown into a greater passion by these remarks, the  lodger lapsed into a broad grin and looked at Mr Swiveller with  twinkling eyes.
  He was a brown-faced sun-burnt man, and appeared  browner and more sun-burnt from having a white nightcap on.
  As it was  clear that he was a choleric fellow in some respects, Mr Swiveller was  relieved to find him in such good humour, and, to encourage him in it,  smiled himself.
    The lodger, in the testiness of being so rudely roused, had pushed his  nightcap very much on one side of his bald head.
  This gave him a  rakish eccentric air which, now that he had leisure to observe it,  charmed Mr Swiveller exceedingly; therefore, by way of propitiation, he  expressed his hope that the gentleman was going to get up, and further  that he would never do so any more.
    'Come here, you impudent rascal!' was the lodger's answer as he  re-entered his room.
    Mr Swiveller followed him in, leaving the stool outside, but reserving  the ruler in case of a surprise.
  He rather congratulated himself on  his prudence when the single gentleman, without notice or explanation  of any kind, double-locked the door.
    'Can you drink anything?' was his next inquiry.
    Mr Swiveller replied that he had very recently been assuaging the pangs  of thirst, but that he was still open to 'a modest quencher,' if the  materials were at hand.
  Without another word spoken on either side,  the lodger took from his great trunk, a kind of temple, shining as of  polished silver, and placed it carefully on the table.
    Greatly interested in his proceedings, Mr Swiveller observed him  closely.
  Into one little chamber of this temple, he dropped an egg;  into another some coffee; into a third a compact piece of raw steak  from a neat tin case; into a fourth, he poured some water.
  Then, with  the aid of a phosphorus-box and some matches, he procured a light and  applied it to a spirit-lamp which had a place of its own below the  temple; then, he shut down the lids of all the little chambers; then he  opened them; and then, by some wonderful and unseen agency, the steak  was done, the egg was boiled, the coffee was accurately prepared, and  his breakfast was ready.
    'Hot water--' said the lodger, handing it to Mr Swiveller with as much  coolness as if he had a kitchen fire before him--'extraordinary  rum--sugar--and a travelling glass.
  Mix for yourself.
  And make haste.
'    Dick complied, his eyes wandering all the time from the temple on the  table, which seemed to do everything, to the great trunk which seemed  to hold everything.
  The lodger took his breakfast like a man who was  used to work these miracles, and thought nothing of them.
    'The man of the house is a lawyer, is he not?' said the lodger.
    Dick nodded.
  The rum was amazing.
    'The woman of the house--what's she?'    'A dragon,' said Dick.
    The single gentleman, perhaps because he had met with such things in  his travels, or perhaps because he WAS a single gentleman, evinced no  surprise, but merely inquired 'Wife or sister?'--'Sister,' said  Dick.
--'So much the better,' said the single gentleman, 'he can get rid  of her when he likes.
'    'I want to do as I like, young man,' he added after a short silence;  'to go to bed when I like, get up when I like, come in when I like, go  out when I like--to be asked no questions and be surrounded by no  spies.
  In this last respect, servants are the devil.
  There's only one  here.
'    'And a very little one,' said Dick.
    'And a very little one,' repeated the lodger.
  'Well, the place will  suit me, will it?'    'Yes,' said Dick.
    'Sharks, I suppose?' said the lodger.
    Dick nodded assent, and drained his glass.
    'Let them know my humour,' said the single gentleman, rising.
  'If they  disturb me, they lose a good tenant.
  If they know me to be that, they  know enough.
  If they try to know more, it's a notice to quit.
  It's  better to understand these things at once.
  Good day.
'    'I beg your pardon,' said Dick, halting in his passage to the door,  which the lodger prepared to open.
  'When he who adores thee has left  but the name--'    'What do you mean?'    '--But the name,' said Dick--'has left but the name--in case of letters  or parcels--'    'I never have any,' returned the lodger.
    'Or in the case anybody should call.
'    'Nobody ever calls on me.
'    'If any mistake should arise from not having the name, don't say it was  my fault, Sir,' added Dick, still lingering.
--'Oh blame not the bard--'    'I'll blame nobody,' said the lodger, with such irascibility that in a  moment Dick found himself on the staircase, and the locked door between  them.
    Mr Brass and Miss Sally were lurking hard by, having been, indeed, only  routed from the keyhole by Mr Swiveller's abrupt exit.
  As their utmost  exertions had not enabled them to overhear a word of the interview,  however, in consequence of a quarrel for precedence, which, though  limited of necessity to pushes and pinches and such quiet pantomime,  had lasted the whole time, they hurried him down to the office to hear  his account of the conversation.
    This Mr Swiveller gave them--faithfully as regarded the wishes and  character of the single gentleman, and poetically as concerned the  great trunk, of which he gave a description more remarkable for  brilliancy of imagination than a strict adherence to truth; declaring,  with many strong asseverations, that it contained a specimen of every  kind of rich food and wine, known in these times, and in particular  that it was of a self-acting kind and served up whatever was required,  as he supposed by clock-work.
 He also gave them to understand that the  cooking apparatus roasted a fine piece of sirloin of beef, weighing  about six pounds avoir-dupoise, in two minutes and a quarter, as he had  himself witnessed, and proved by his sense of taste; and further, that,  however the effect was produced, he had distinctly seen water boil and  bubble up when the single gentleman winked; from which facts he (Mr  Swiveller) was led to infer that the lodger was some great conjuror or  chemist, or both, whose residence under that roof could not fail at  some future days to shed a great credit and distinction on the name of  Brass, and add a new interest to the history of Bevis Marks.
    There was one point which Mr Swiveller deemed it unnecessary to enlarge  upon, and that was the fact of the modest quencher, which, by reason of  its intrinsic strength and its coming close upon the heels of the  temperate beverage he had discussed at dinner, awakened a slight degree  of fever, and rendered necessary two or three other modest quenchers at  the public-house in the course of the evening.
              As the single gentleman after some weeks' occupation of his lodgings,  still declined to correspond, by word or gesture, either with Mr Brass  or his sister Sally, but invariably chose Richard Swiveller as his  channel of communication; and as he proved himself in all respects a  highly desirable inmate, paying for everything beforehand, giving very  little trouble, making no noise, and keeping early hours; Mr Richard  imperceptibly rose to an important position in the family, as one who  had influence over this mysterious lodger, and could negotiate with  him, for good or evil, when nobody else durst approach his person.
    If the truth must be told, even Mr Swiveller's approaches to the single  gentleman were of a very distant kind, and met with small  encouragement; but, as he never returned from a monosyllabic conference  with the unknown, without quoting such expressions as 'Swiveller, I  know I can rely upon you,'--'I have no hesitation in saying, Swiveller,  that I entertain a regard for you,'--'Swiveller, you are my friend, and  will stand by me I am sure,' with many other short speeches of the same  familiar and confiding kind, purporting to have been addressed by the  single gentleman to himself, and to form the staple of their ordinary  discourse, neither Mr Brass nor Miss Sally for a moment questioned the  extent of his influence, but accorded to him their fullest and most  unqualified belief.
    But quite apart from, and independent of, this source of popularity, Mr  Swiveller had another, which promised to be equally enduring, and to  lighten his position considerably.
    He found favour in the eyes of Miss Sally Brass.
  Let not the light  scorners of female fascination erect their ears to listen to a new tale  of love which shall serve them for a jest; for Miss Brass, however  accurately formed to be beloved, was not of the loving kind.
  That  amiable virgin, having clung to the skirts of the Law from her earliest  youth; having sustained herself by their aid, as it were, in her first  running alone, and maintained a firm grasp upon them ever since; had  passed her life in a kind of legal childhood.
  She had been remarkable,  when a tender prattler for an uncommon talent in counterfeiting the  walk and manner of a bailiff: in which character she had learned to tap  her little playfellows on the shoulder, and to carry them off to  imaginary sponging-houses, with a correctness of imitation which was  the surprise and delight of all who witnessed her performances, and  which was only to be exceeded by her exquisite manner of putting an  execution into her doll's house, and taking an exact inventory of the  chairs and tables.
  These artless sports had naturally soothed and  cheered the decline of her widowed father: a most exemplary gentleman  (called 'old Foxey' by his friends from his extreme sagacity,) who  encouraged them to the utmost, and whose chief regret, on finding that  he drew near to Houndsditch churchyard, was, that his daughter could  not take out an attorney's certificate and hold a place upon the roll.
  Filled with this affectionate and touching sorrow, he had solemnly  confided her to his son Sampson as an invaluable auxiliary; and from  the old gentleman's decease to the period of which we treat, Miss Sally  Brass had been the prop and pillar of his business.
    It is obvious that, having devoted herself from infancy to this one  pursuit and study, Miss Brass could know but little of the world,  otherwise than in connection with the law; and that from a lady gifted  with such high tastes, proficiency in those gentler and softer arts in  which women usually excel, was scarcely to be looked for.
  Miss Sally's  accomplishments were all of a masculine and strictly legal kind.
  They  began with the practice of an attorney and they ended with it.
  She was  in a state of lawful innocence, so to speak.
  The law had been her  nurse.
  And, as bandy-legs or such physical deformities in children are  held to be the consequence of bad nursing, so, if in a mind so  beautiful any moral twist or handiness could be found, Miss Sally  Brass's nurse was alone to blame.
    It was upon this lady, then, that Mr Swiveller burst in full freshness as  something new and hitherto undreamed of, lighting up the office with  scraps of song and merriment, conjuring with inkstands and boxes of  wafers, catching three oranges in one hand, balancing stools upon his  chin and penknives on his nose, and constantly performing a hundred  other feats with equal ingenuity; for with such unbendings did Richard,  in Mr Brass's absence, relieve the tedium of his confinement.
  These  social qualities, which Miss Sally first discovered by accident,  gradually made such an impression upon her, that she would entreat Mr  Swiveller to relax as though she were not by, which Mr Swiveller,  nothing loth, would readily consent to do.
  By these means a friendship  sprung up between them.
  Mr Swiveller gradually came to look upon her  as her brother Sampson did, and as he would have looked upon any other  clerk.
  He imparted to her the mystery of going the odd man or plain  Newmarket for fruit, ginger-beer, baked potatoes, or even a modest  quencher, of which Miss Brass did not scruple to partake.
  He would  often persuade her to undertake his share of writing in addition to her  own; nay, he would sometimes reward her with a hearty slap on the back,  and protest that she was a devilish good fellow, a jolly dog, and so  forth; all of which compliments Miss Sally would receive in entire good  part and with perfect satisfaction.
    One circumstance troubled Mr Swiveller's mind very much, and that was  that the small servant always remained somewhere in the bowels of the  earth under Bevis Marks, and never came to the surface unless the  single gentleman rang his bell, when she would answer it and  immediately disappear again.
  She never went out, or came into the  office, or had a clean face, or took off the coarse apron, or looked  out of any one of the windows, or stood at the street-door for a breath  of air, or had any rest or enjoyment whatever.
  Nobody ever came to see  her, nobody spoke of her, nobody cared about her.
  Mr Brass had said  once, that he believed she was a 'love-child' (which means anything but  a child of love), and that was all the information Richard Swiveller  could obtain.
    'It's of no use asking the dragon,' thought Dick one day, as he sat  contemplating the features of Miss Sally Brass.
  'I suspect if I asked  any questions on that head, our alliance would be at an end.
  I wonder  whether she is a dragon by-the-bye, or something in the mermaid way.
  She has rather a scaly appearance.
  But mermaids are fond of looking at  themselves in the glass, which she can't be.
  And they have a habit of  combing their hair, which she hasn't.
  No, she's a dragon.
'    'Where are you going, old fellow?' said Dick aloud, as Miss Sally wiped  her pen as usual on the green dress, and uprose from her seat.
    'To dinner,' answered the dragon.
    'To dinner!' thought Dick, 'that's another circumstance.
  I don't  believe that small servant ever has anything to eat.
'    'Sammy won't be home,' said Miss Brass.
  'Stop till I come back.
  I  sha'n't be long.
'    Dick nodded, and followed Miss Brass--with his eyes to the door, and  with his ears to a little back parlour, where she and her brother took  their meals.
    'Now,' said Dick, walking up and down with his hands in his pockets,  'I'd give something--if I had it--to know how they use that child, and  where they keep her.
  My mother must have been a very inquisitive  woman; I have no doubt I'm marked with a note of interrogation  somewhere.
  My feelings I smother, but thou hast been the cause of this  anguish, my--upon my word,' said Mr Swiveller, checking himself and  falling thoughtfully into the client's chair, 'I should like to know  how they use her!'    After running on, in this way, for some time, Mr Swiveller softly  opened the office door, with the intention of darting across the street  for a glass of the mild porter.
  At that moment he caught a parting  glimpse of the brown head-dress of Miss Brass flitting down the kitchen  stairs.
  'And by Jove!' thought Dick, 'she's going to feed the small  servant.
  Now or never!'    First peeping over the handrail and allowing the head-dress to  disappear in the darkness below, he groped his way down, and arrived at  the door of a back kitchen immediately after Miss Brass had entered the  same, bearing in her hand a cold leg of mutton.
  It was a very dark  miserable place, very low and very damp: the walls disfigured by a  thousand rents and blotches.
  The water was trickling out of a leaky  butt, and a most wretched cat was lapping up the drops with the sickly  eagerness of starvation.
  The grate, which was a wide one, was wound  and screwed up tight, so as to hold no more than a little thin sandwich  of fire.
  Everything was locked up; the coal-cellar, the candle-box,  the salt-box, the meat-safe, were all padlocked.
  There was nothing  that a beetle could have lunched upon.
  The pinched and meagre aspect  of the place would have killed a chameleon.
  He would have known, at  the first mouthful, that the air was not eatable, and must have given up  the ghost in despair.
 The small servant stood with humility in presence  of Miss Sally, and hung her head.
    'Are you there?' said Miss Sally.
    'Yes, ma'am,' was the answer in a weak voice.
    'Go further away from the leg of mutton, or you'll be picking it, I  know,' said Miss Sally.
    The girl withdrew into a corner, while Miss Brass took a key from her  pocket, and opening the safe, brought from it a dreary waste of cold  potatoes, looking as eatable as Stonehenge.
  This she placed before the  small servant, ordering her to sit down before it, and then, taking up  a great carving-knife, made a mighty show of sharpening it upon the  carving-fork.
    'Do you see this?' said Miss Brass, slicing off about two square inches  of cold mutton, after all this preparation, and holding it out on the  point of the fork.
    The small servant looked hard enough at it with her hungry eyes to see  every shred of it, small as it was, and answered, 'yes.
'    'Then don't you ever go and say,' retorted Miss Sally, 'that you hadn't  meat here.
  There, eat it up.
'    This was soon done.
  'Now, do you want any more?' said Miss Sally.
    The hungry creature answered with a faint 'No.
'  They were evidently  going through an established form.
    'You've been helped once to meat,' said Miss Brass, summing up the  facts; 'you have had as much as you can eat, you're asked if you want  any more, and you answer, 'no!' Then don't you ever go and say you were  allowanced, mind that.
'    With those words, Miss Sally put the meat away and locked the safe, and  then drawing near to the small servant, overlooked her while she  finished the potatoes.
    It was plain that some extraordinary grudge was working in Miss Brass's  gentle breast, and that it was that which impelled her, without the  smallest present cause, to rap the child with the blade of the knife,  now on her hand, now on her head, and now on her back, as if she found  it quite impossible to stand so close to her without administering a  few slight knocks.
  But Mr Swiveller was not a little surprised to see  his fellow-clerk, after walking slowly backwards towards the door, as  if she were trying to withdraw herself from the room but could not  accomplish it, dart suddenly forward, and falling on the small servant  give her some hard blows with her clenched hand.
  The victim cried, but  in a subdued manner as if she feared to raise her voice, and Miss  Sally, comforting herself with a pinch of snuff, ascended the stairs,  just as Richard had safely reached the office.
              The single gentleman among his other peculiarities--and he had a very  plentiful stock, of which he every day furnished some new  specimen--took a most extraordinary and remarkable interest in the  exhibition of Punch.
  If the sound of a Punch's voice, at ever so  remote a distance, reached Bevis Marks, the single gentleman, though in  bed and asleep, would start up, and, hurrying on his clothes, make for  the spot with all speed, and presently return at the head of a long  procession of idlers, having in the midst the theatre and its  proprietors.
  Straightway, the stage would be set up in front of Mr  Brass's house; the single gentleman would establish himself at the  first floor window; and the entertainment would proceed, with all its  exciting accompaniments of fife and drum and shout, to the excessive  consternation of all sober votaries of business in that silent  thoroughfare.
  It might have been expected that when the play was done,  both players and audience would have dispersed; but the epilogue was as  bad as the play, for no sooner was the Devil dead, than the manager of  the puppets and his partner were summoned by the single gentleman to  his chamber, where they were regaled with strong waters from his  private store, and where they held with him long conversations, the  purport of which no human being could fathom.
  But the secret of these  discussions was of little importance.
  It was sufficient to know that  while they were proceeding, the concourse without still lingered round  the house; that boys beat upon the drum with their fists, and imitated  Punch with their tender voices; that the office-window was rendered  opaque by flattened noses, and the key-hole of the street-door luminous  with eyes; that every time the single gentleman or either of his guests  was seen at the upper window, or so much as the end of one of their  noses was visible, there was a great shout of execration from the  excluded mob, who remained howling and yelling, and refusing  consolation, until the exhibitors were delivered up to them to be  attended elsewhere.
  It was sufficient, in short, to know that Bevis  Marks was revolutionised by these popular movements, and that peace and  quietness fled from its precincts.
    Nobody was rendered more indignant by these proceedings than Mr Sampson  Brass, who, as he could by no means afford to lose so profitable an  inmate, deemed it prudent to pocket his lodger's affront along with his  cash, and to annoy the audiences who clustered round his door by such  imperfect means of retaliation as were open to him, and which were  confined to the trickling down of foul water on their heads from unseen  watering pots, pelting them with fragments of tile and mortar from the  roof of the house, and bribing the drivers of hackney cabriolets to  come suddenly round the corner and dash in among them precipitately.
  It may, at first sight, be matter of surprise to the thoughtless few  that Mr Brass, being a professional gentleman, should not have legally  indicted some party or parties, active in the promotion of the  nuisance, but they will be good enough to remember, that as Doctors  seldom take their own prescriptions, and Divines do not always practise  what they preach, so lawyers are shy of meddling with the Law on their  own account: knowing it to be an edged tool of uncertain application,  very expensive in the working, and rather remarkable for its properties  of close shaving, than for its always shaving the right person.
    'Come,' said Mr Brass one afternoon, 'this is two days without a Punch.
  I'm in hopes he has run through 'em all, at last.
'    'Why are you in hopes?' returned Miss Sally.
  'What harm do they do?'    'Here's a pretty sort of a fellow!' cried Brass, laying down his pen in  despair.
  'Now here's an aggravating animal!'    'Well, what harm do they do?' retorted Sally.
    'What harm!' cried Brass.
  'Is it no harm to have a constant hallooing  and hooting under one's very nose, distracting one from business, and  making one grind one's teeth with vexation?  Is it no harm to be  blinded and choked up, and have the king's highway stopped with a set  of screamers and roarers whose throats must be made of--of--'    'Brass,' suggested Mr Swiveller.
    'Ah! of brass,' said the lawyer, glancing at his clerk, to assure  himself that he had suggested the word in good faith and without any  sinister intention.
  'Is that no harm?'    The lawyer stopped short in his invective, and listening for a moment,  and recognising the well-known voice, rested his head upon his hand,  raised his eyes to the ceiling, and muttered faintly, 'There's another!'    Up went the single gentleman's window directly.
    'There's another,' repeated Brass; 'and if I could get a break and four  blood horses to cut into the Marks when the crowd is at its thickest,  I'd give eighteen-pence and never grudge it!'    The distant squeak was heard again.
  The single gentleman's door burst  open.
  He ran violently down the stairs, out into the street, and so  past the window, without any hat, towards the quarter whence the sound  proceeded--bent, no doubt, upon securing the strangers' services  directly.
    'I wish I only knew who his friends were,' muttered Sampson, filling  his pocket with papers; 'if they'd just get up a pretty little  Commission de lunatico at the Gray's Inn Coffee House and give me the  job, I'd be content to have the lodgings empty for one while, at all  events.
'    With which words, and knocking his hat over his eyes as if for the  purpose of shutting out even a glimpse of the dreadful visitation, Mr  Brass rushed from the house and hurried away.
    As Mr Swiveller was decidedly favourable to these performances, upon  the ground that looking at a Punch, or indeed looking at anything out  of window, was better than working; and as he had been, for this  reason, at some pains to awaken in his fellow clerk a sense of their  beauties and manifold deserts; both he and Miss Sally rose as with one  accord and took up their positions at the window: upon the sill  whereof, as in a post of honour, sundry young ladies and gentlemen who  were employed in the dry nurture of babies, and who made a point of  being present, with their young charges, on such occasions, had already  established themselves as comfortably as the circumstances would allow.
    The glass being dim, Mr Swiveller, agreeably to a friendly custom which  he had established between them, hitched off the brown head-dress from  Miss Sally's head, and dusted it carefully therewith.
  By the time he  had handed it back, and its beautiful wearer had put it on again (which  she did with perfect composure and indifference), the lodger returned  with the show and showmen at his heels, and a strong addition to the  body of spectators.
  The exhibitor disappeared with all speed behind  the drapery; and his partner, stationing himself by the side of the  Theatre, surveyed the audience with a remarkable expression of  melancholy, which became more remarkable still when he breathed a  hornpipe tune into that sweet musical instrument which is popularly  termed a mouth-organ, without at all changing the mournful expression  of the upper part of his face, though his mouth and chin were, of  necessity, in lively spasms.
    The drama proceeded to its close, and held the spectators enchained in  the customary manner.
  The sensation which kindles in large assemblies,  when they are relieved from a state of breathless suspense and are  again free to speak and move, was yet rife, when the lodger, as usual,  summoned the men up stairs.
    'Both of you,' he called from the window; for only the actual  exhibitor--a little fat man--prepared to obey the summons.
  'I want to  talk to you.
  Come both of you!'    'Come, Tommy,' said the little man.
    'I an't a talker,' replied the other.
  'Tell him so.
  What should I go  and talk for?'    'Don't you see the gentleman's got a bottle and glass up there?'  returned the little man.
    'And couldn't you have said so at first?' retorted the other with  sudden alacrity.
  'Now, what are you waiting for?  Are you going to  keep the gentleman expecting us all day?  haven't you no manners?'    With this remonstrance, the melancholy man, who was no other than Mr  Thomas Codlin, pushed past his friend and brother in the craft, Mr  Harris, otherwise Short or Trotters, and hurried before him to the  single gentleman's apartment.
    'Now, my men,' said the single gentleman; 'you have done very well.
  What will you take?  Tell that little man behind, to shut the door.
'    'Shut the door, can't you?' said Mr Codlin, turning gruffly to his  friend.
  'You might have knowed that the gentleman wanted the door  shut, without being told, I think.
'    Mr Short obeyed, observing under his breath that his friend seemed  unusually 'cranky,' and expressing a hope that there was no dairy in  the neighbourhood, or his temper would certainly spoil its contents.
    The gentleman pointed to a couple of chairs, and intimated by an  emphatic nod of his head that he expected them to be seated.
  Messrs  Codlin and Short, after looking at each other with considerable doubt  and indecision, at length sat down--each on the extreme edge of the  chair pointed out to him--and held their hats very tight, while the  single gentleman filled a couple of glasses from a bottle on the table  beside him, and presented them in due form.
    'You're pretty well browned by the sun, both of you,' said their  entertainer.
  'Have you been travelling?'    Mr Short replied in the affirmative with a nod and a smile.
  Mr Codlin  added a corroborative nod and a short groan, as if he still felt the  weight of the Temple on his shoulders.
    'To fairs, markets, races, and so forth, I suppose?' pursued the single  gentleman.
    'Yes, sir,' returned Short, 'pretty nigh all over the West of England.
'    'I have talked to men of your craft from North, East, and South,'  returned their host, in rather a hasty manner; 'but I never lighted on  any from the West before.
'    'It's our reg'lar summer circuit is the West, master,' said Short;  'that's where it is.
  We takes the East of London in the spring and  winter, and the West of England in the summer time.
  Many's the hard  day's walking in rain and mud, and with never a penny earned, we've had  down in the West.
'    'Let me fill your glass again.
'    'Much obleeged to you sir, I think I will,' said Mr Codlin, suddenly  thrusting in his own and turning Short's aside.
  'I'm the sufferer,  sir, in all the travelling, and in all the staying at home.
  In town or  country, wet or dry, hot or cold, Tom Codlin suffers.
  But Tom Codlin  isn't to complain for all that.
  Oh, no!  Short may complain, but if  Codlin grumbles by so much as a word--oh dear, down with him, down  with him directly.
  It isn't his place to grumble.
  That's quite out of  the question.
'    'Codlin an't without his usefulness,' observed Short with an arch look,  'but he don't always keep his eyes open.
  He falls asleep sometimes,  you know.
  Remember them last races, Tommy.
'    'Will you never leave off aggravating a man?' said Codlin.
  'It's very  like I was asleep when five-and-tenpence was collected, in one round,  isn't it?  I was attending to my business, and couldn't have my eyes in  twenty places at once, like a peacock, no more than you could.
  If I  an't a match for an old man and a young child, you an't neither, so  don't throw that out against me, for the cap fits your head quite as  correct as it fits mine.
'    'You may as well drop the subject, Tom,' said Short.
  'It isn't  particular agreeable to the gentleman, I dare say.
'    'Then you shouldn't have brought it up,' returned Mr Codlin; 'and I ask  the gentleman's pardon on your account, as a giddy chap that likes to  hear himself talk, and don't much care what he talks about, so that he  does talk.
'    Their entertainer had sat perfectly quiet in the beginning of this  dispute, looking first at one man and then at the other, as if he were  lying in wait for an opportunity of putting some further question, or  reverting to that from which the discourse had strayed.
  But, from the  point where Mr Codlin was charged with sleepiness, he had shown an  increasing interest in the discussion: which now attained a very high  pitch.
    'You are the two men I want,' he said, 'the two men I have been looking  for, and searching after!  Where are that old man and that child you  speak of?'    'Sir?' said Short, hesitating, and looking towards his friend.
    'The old man and his grandchild who travelled with you--where are they?  It will be worth your while to speak out, I assure you; much better  worth your while than you believe.
  They left you, you say--at those  races, as I understand.
  They have been traced to that place, and there  lost sight of.
  Have you no clue, can you suggest no clue, to their  recovery?'    'Did I always say, Thomas,' cried Short, turning with a look of  amazement to his friend, 'that there was sure to be an inquiry after  them two travellers?'    'YOU said!' returned Mr Codlin.
  'Did I always say that that 'ere  blessed child was the most interesting I ever see?  Did I always say I  loved her, and doated on her?  Pretty creetur, I think I hear her now.
  "Codlin's my friend," she says, with a tear of gratitude a trickling  down her little eye; "Codlin's my friend," she says--"not Short.
  Short's very well," she says; "I've no quarrel with Short; he means  kind, I dare say; but Codlin," she says, "has the feelings for my  money, though he mayn't look it.
"'    Repeating these words with great emotion, Mr Codlin rubbed the bridge  of his nose with his coat-sleeve, and shaking his head mournfully from  side to side, left the single gentleman to infer that, from the moment  when he lost sight of his dear young charge, his peace of mind and  happiness had fled.
    'Good Heaven!' said the single gentleman, pacing up and down the room,  'have I found these men at last, only to discover that they can give me  no information or assistance!  It would have been better to have lived  on, in hope, from day to day, and never to have lighted on them, than  to have my expectations scattered thus.
'    'Stay a minute,' said Short.
  'A man of the name of Jerry--you know  Jerry, Thomas?'    'Oh, don't talk to me of Jerrys,' replied Mr Codlin.
  'How can I care a  pinch of snuff for Jerrys, when I think of that 'ere darling child?  "Codlin's my friend," she says, "dear, good, kind Codlin, as is always  a devising pleasures for me!  I don't object to Short," she says, "but  I cotton to Codlin.
" Once,' said that gentleman reflectively, 'she  called me Father Codlin.
  I thought I should have bust!'    'A man of the name of Jerry, sir,' said Short, turning from his selfish  colleague to their new acquaintance, 'wot keeps a company of dancing  dogs, told me, in a accidental sort of way, that he had seen the old  gentleman in connexion with a travelling wax-work, unbeknown to him.
  As they'd given us the slip, and nothing had come of it, and this was  down in the country that he'd been seen, I took no measures about it,  and asked no questions--But I can, if you like.
'    'Is this man in town?' said the impatient single gentleman.
  'Speak  faster.
'    'No he isn't, but he will be to-morrow, for he lodges in our house,'  replied Mr Short rapidly.
    'Then bring him here,' said the single gentleman.
  'Here's a sovereign  a-piece.
  If I can find these people through your means, it is but a  prelude to twenty more.
  Return to me to-morrow, and keep your own  counsel on this subject--though I need hardly tell you that; for you'll  do so for your own sakes.
  Now, give me your address, and leave me.
'    The address was given, the two men departed, the crowd went with them,  and the single gentleman for two mortal hours walked in uncommon  agitation up and down his room, over the wondering heads of Mr  Swiveller and Miss Sally Brass.
              Kit--for it happens at this juncture, not only that we have breathing  time to follow his fortunes, but that the necessities of these  adventures so adapt themselves to our ease and inclination as to call  upon us imperatively to pursue the track we most desire to take--Kit,  while the matters treated of in the last fifteen chapters were yet in  progress, was, as the reader may suppose, gradually familiarising  himself more and more with Mr and Mrs Garland, Mr Abel, the pony, and  Barbara, and gradually coming to consider them one and all as his  particular private friends, and Abel Cottage, Finchley, as his own  proper home.
    Stay--the words are written, and may go, but if they convey any notion  that Kit, in the plentiful board and comfortable lodging of his new  abode, began to think slightingly of the poor fare and furniture of his  old dwelling, they do their office badly and commit injustice.
  Who so  mindful of those he left at home--albeit they were but a mother and two  young babies--as Kit?  What boastful father in the fulness of his heart  ever related such wonders of his infant prodigy, as Kit never wearied  of telling Barbara in the evening time, concerning little Jacob?  Was  there ever such a mother as Kit's mother, on her son's showing; or was  there ever such comfort in poverty as in the poverty of Kit's family,  if any correct judgment might be arrived at, from his own glowing  account!    And let me linger in this place, for an instant, to remark that if ever  household affections and loves are graceful things, they are graceful  in the poor.
  The ties that bind the wealthy and the proud to home may  be forged on earth, but those which link the poor man to his humble  hearth are of the truer metal and bear the stamp of Heaven.
  The man of  high descent may love the halls and lands of his inheritance as part of  himself: as trophies of his birth and power; his associations with them  are associations of pride and wealth and triumph; the poor man's  attachment to the tenements he holds, which strangers have held before,  and may to-morrow occupy again, has a worthier root, struck deep into a  purer soil.
  His household gods are of flesh and blood, with no alloy  of silver, gold, or precious stone; he has no property but in the  affections of his own heart; and when they endear bare floors and  walls, despite of rags and toil and scanty fare, that man has his love  of home from God, and his rude hut becomes a solemn place.
    Oh! if those who rule the destinies of nations would but remember  this--if they would but think how hard it is for the very poor to have  engendered in their hearts, that love of home from which all domestic  virtues spring, when they live in dense and squalid masses where social  decency is lost, or rather never found--if they would but turn aside  from the wide thoroughfares and great houses, and strive to improve the  wretched dwellings in bye-ways where only Poverty may walk--many low  roofs would point more truly to the sky, than the loftiest steeple that  now rears proudly up from the midst of guilt, and crime, and horrible  disease, to mock them by its contrast.
  In hollow voices from  Workhouse, Hospital, and jail, this truth is preached from day to day,  and has been proclaimed for years.
  It is no light matter--no outcry  from the working vulgar--no mere question of the people's health and  comforts that may be whistled down on Wednesday nights.
  In love of  home, the love of country has its rise; and who are the truer patriots  or the better in time of need--those who venerate the land, owning its  wood, and stream, and earth, and all that they produce?  or those who  love their country, boasting not a foot of ground in all its wide  domain!    Kit knew nothing about such questions, but he knew that his old home  was a very poor place, and that his new one was very unlike it, and yet  he was constantly looking back with grateful satisfaction and  affectionate anxiety, and often indited square-folded letters to his  mother, enclosing a shilling or eighteenpence or such other small  remittance, which Mr Abel's liberality enabled him to make.
  Sometimes  being in the neighbourhood, he had leisure to call upon her, and then  great was the joy and pride of Kit's mother, and extremely noisy the  satisfaction of little Jacob and the baby, and cordial the  congratulations of the whole court, who listened with admiring ears to  the accounts of Abel Cottage, and could never be told too much of its  wonders and magnificence.
    Although Kit was in the very highest favour with the old lady and  gentleman, and Mr Abel, and Barbara, it is certain that no member of  the family evinced such a remarkable partiality for him as the  self-willed pony, who, from being the most obstinate and opinionated  pony on the face of the earth, was, in his hands, the meekest and most  tractable of animals.
  It is true that in exact proportion as he became  manageable by Kit he became utterly ungovernable by anybody else (as if  he had determined to keep him in the family at all risks and hazards),  and that, even under the guidance of his favourite, he would sometimes  perform a great variety of strange freaks and capers, to the extreme  discomposure of the old lady's nerves; but as Kit always represented  that this was only his fun, or a way he had of showing his attachment  to his employers, Mrs Garland gradually suffered herself to be  persuaded into the belief, in which she at last became so strongly  confirmed, that if, in one of these ebullitions, he had overturned the  chaise, she would have been quite satisfied that he did it with the  very best intentions.
    Besides becoming in a short time a perfect marvel in all stable  matters, Kit soon made himself a very tolerable gardener, a handy  fellow within doors, and an indispensable attendant on Mr Abel, who  every day gave him some new proof of his confidence and approbation.
  Mr Witherden the notary, too, regarded him with a friendly eye; and  even Mr Chuckster would sometimes condescend to give him a slight nod,  or to honour him with that peculiar form of recognition which is called  'taking a sight,' or to favour him with some other salute combining  pleasantry with patronage.
    One morning Kit drove Mr Abel to the Notary's office, as he sometimes  did, and having set him down at the house, was about to drive off to a  livery stable hard by, when this same Mr Chuckster emerged from the  office door, and cried 'Woa-a-a-a-a-a!'--dwelling upon the note a long  time, for the purpose of striking terror into the pony's heart, and  asserting the supremacy of man over the inferior animals.
    'Pull up, Snobby,' cried Mr Chuckster, addressing himself to Kit.
  'You're wanted inside here.
'    'Has Mr Abel forgotten anything, I wonder?' said Kit as he dismounted.
    'Ask no questions, Snobby,' returned Mr Chuckster, 'but go and see.
  Woa-a-a then, will you?  If that pony was mine, I'd break him.
'    'You must be very gentle with him, if you please,' said Kit, 'or you'll  find him troublesome.
  You'd better not keep on pulling his ears,  please.
  I know he won't like it.
'    To this remonstrance Mr Chuckster deigned no other answer, than  addressing Kit with a lofty and distant air as 'young feller,' and  requesting him to cut and come again with all speed.
  The 'young  feller' complying, Mr Chuckster put his hands in his pockets, and tried  to look as if he were not minding the pony, but happened to be lounging  there by accident.
    Kit scraped his shoes very carefully (for he had not yet lost his  reverence for the bundles of papers and the tin boxes,) and tapped at  the office-door, which was quickly opened by the Notary himself.
    'Oh! come in, Christopher,' said Mr Witherden.
    'Is that the lad?' asked an elderly gentleman, but of a stout, bluff  figure--who was in the room.
    'That's the lad,' said Mr Witherden.
  'He fell in with my client, Mr  Garland, sir, at this very door.
  I have reason to think he is a good  lad, sir, and that you may believe what he says.
  Let me introduce Mr  Abel Garland, sir--his young master; my articled pupil, sir, and most  particular friend:--my most particular friend, sir,' repeated the  Notary, drawing out his silk handkerchief and flourishing it about his  face.
    'Your servant, sir,' said the stranger gentleman.
    'Yours, sir, I'm sure,' replied Mr Abel mildly.
  'You were wishing to  speak to Christopher, sir?'    'Yes, I was.
  Have I your permission?'    'By all means.
'    'My business is no secret; or I should rather say it need be no secret  here,' said the stranger, observing that Mr Abel and the Notary were  preparing to retire.
  'It relates to a dealer in curiosities with whom  he lived, and in whom I am earnestly and warmly interested.
  I have  been a stranger to this country, gentlemen, for very many years, and if  I am deficient in form and ceremony, I hope you will forgive me.
'    'No forgiveness is necessary, sir;--none whatever,' replied the Notary.
  And so said Mr Abel.
    'I have been making inquiries in the neighbourhood in which his old  master lived,' said the stranger, 'and I learn that he was served by  this lad.
  I have found out his mother's house, and have been directed  by her to this place as the nearest in which I should be likely to find  him.
  That's the cause of my presenting myself here this morning.
'    'I am very glad of any cause, sir,' said the Notary, 'which procures me  the honour of this visit.
'    'Sir,' retorted the stranger, 'you speak like a mere man of the world,  and I think you something better.
  Therefore, pray do not sink your  real character in paying unmeaning compliments to me.
'    'Hem!' coughed the Notary.
  'You're a plain speaker, sir.
'    'And a plain dealer,' returned the stranger.
  'It may be my long  absence and inexperience that lead me to the conclusion; but if plain  speakers are scarce in this part of the world, I fancy plain dealers  are still scarcer.
  If my speaking should offend you, sir, my dealing,  I hope, will make amends.
'    Mr Witherden seemed a little disconcerted by the elderly gentleman's  mode of conducting the dialogue; and as for Kit, he looked at him in  open-mouthed astonishment: wondering what kind of language he would  address to him, if he talked in that free and easy way to a Notary.
  It  was with no harshness, however, though with something of constitutional  irritability and haste, that he turned to Kit and said:    'If you think, my lad, that I am pursuing these inquiries with any  other view than that of serving and reclaiming those I am in search of,  you do me a very great wrong, and deceive yourself.
  Don't be deceived,  I beg of you, but rely upon my assurance.
  The fact is, gentlemen,' he  added, turning again to the Notary and his pupil, 'that I am in a very  painful and wholly unexpected position.
  I came to this city with a  darling object at my heart, expecting to find no obstacle or difficulty  in the way of its attainment.
  I find myself suddenly checked and  stopped short, in the execution of my design, by a mystery which I  cannot penetrate.
  Every effort I have made to penetrate it, has only  served to render it darker and more obscure; and I am afraid to stir  openly in the matter, lest those whom I anxiously pursue, should fly  still farther from me.
  I assure you that if you could give me any  assistance, you would not be sorry to do so, if you knew how greatly I  stand in need of it, and what a load it would relieve me from.
'    There was a simplicity in this confidence which occasioned it to find a  quick response in the breast of the good-natured Notary, who replied,  in the same spirit, that the stranger had not mistaken his desire, and  that if he could be of service to him, he would, most readily.
    Kit was then put under examination and closely questioned by the  unknown gentleman, touching his old master and the child, their lonely  way of life, their retired habits, and strict seclusion.
  The nightly  absence of the old man, the solitary existence of the child at those  times, his illness and recovery, Quilp's possession of the house, and  their sudden disappearance, were all the subjects of much questioning  and answer.
  Finally, Kit informed the gentleman that the premises were  now to let, and that a board upon the door referred all inquirers to Mr  Sampson Brass, Solicitor, of Bevis Marks, from whom he might perhaps  learn some further particulars.
    'Not by inquiry,' said the gentleman shaking his head.
  'I live there.
'    'Live at Brass's the attorney's!' cried Mr Witherden in some surprise:  having professional knowledge of the gentleman in question.
    'Aye,' was the reply.
  'I entered on his lodgings t'other day, chiefly  because I had seen this very board.
  It matters little to me where I  live, and I had a desperate hope that some intelligence might be cast  in my way there, which would not reach me elsewhere.
  Yes, I live at  Brass's--more shame for me, I suppose?'    'That's a mere matter of opinion,' said the Notary, shrugging his  shoulders.
  'He is looked upon as rather a doubtful character.
'    'Doubtful?' echoed the other.
  'I am glad to hear there's any doubt  about it.
  I supposed that had been thoroughly settled, long ago.
  But  will you let me speak a word or two with you in private?'    Mr Witherden consenting, they walked into that gentleman's private  closet, and remained there, in close conversation, for some quarter of  an hour, when they returned into the outer office.
  The stranger had  left his hat in Mr Witherden's room, and seemed to have established  himself in this short interval on quite a friendly footing.
    'I'll not detain you any longer now,' he said, putting a crown into  Kit's hand, and looking towards the Notary.
  'You shall hear from me  again.
  Not a word of this, you know, except to your master and  mistress.
'    'Mother, sir, would be glad to know--' said Kit, faltering.
    'Glad to know what?'    'Anything--so that it was no harm--about Miss Nell.
'    'Would she?  Well then, you may tell her if she can keep a secret.
  But  mind, not a word of this to anybody else.
  Don't forget that.
  Be  particular.
'    'I'll take care, sir,' said Kit.
  'Thankee, sir, and good morning.
'    Now, it happened that the gentleman, in his anxiety to impress upon Kit  that he was not to tell anybody what had passed between them, followed  him out to the door to repeat his caution, and it further happened that  at that moment the eyes of Mr Richard Swiveller were turned in that  direction, and beheld his mysterious friend and Kit together.
    It was quite an accident, and the way in which it came about was this.
  Mr Chuckster, being a gentleman of a cultivated taste and refined  spirit, was one of that Lodge of Glorious Apollos whereof Mr Swiveller  was Perpetual Grand.
  Mr Swiveller, passing through the street in the  execution of some Brazen errand, and beholding one of his Glorious  Brotherhood intently gazing on a pony, crossed over to give him that  fraternal greeting with which Perpetual Grands are, by the very  constitution of their office, bound to cheer and encourage their  disciples.
  He had scarcely bestowed upon him his blessing, and  followed it with a general remark touching the present state and  prospects of the weather, when, lifting up his eyes, he beheld the  single gentleman of Bevis Marks in earnest conversation with  Christopher Nubbles.
    'Hallo!' said Dick, 'who is that?'    'He called to see my Governor this morning,' replied Mr Chuckster;  'beyond that, I don't know him from Adam.
'    'At least you know his name?' said Dick.
    To which Mr Chuckster replied, with an elevation of speech becoming a  Glorious Apollo, that he was 'everlastingly blessed' if he did.
    'All I know, my dear feller,' said Mr Chuckster, running his fingers  through his hair, 'is, that he is the cause of my having stood here  twenty minutes, for which I hate him with a mortal and undying hatred,  and would pursue him to the confines of eternity if I could afford the  time.
'    While they were thus discoursing, the subject of their conversation  (who had not appeared to recognise Mr Richard Swiveller) re-entered the  house, and Kit came down the steps and joined them; to whom Mr  Swiveller again propounded his inquiry with no better success.
    'He is a very nice gentleman, Sir,' said Kit, 'and that's all I know  about him.
'    Mr Chuckster waxed wroth at this answer, and without applying the  remark to any particular case, mentioned, as a general truth, that it  was expedient to break the heads of Snobs, and to tweak their noses.
  Without expressing his concurrence in this sentiment, Mr Swiveller  after a few moments of abstraction inquired which way Kit was driving,  and, being informed, declared it was his way, and that he would  trespass on him for a lift.
  Kit would gladly have declined the  proffered honour, but as Mr Swiveller was already established in the  seat beside him, he had no means of doing so, otherwise than by a  forcible ejectment, and therefore, drove briskly off--so briskly  indeed, as to cut short the leave-taking between Mr Chuckster and his  Grand Master, and to occasion the former gentleman some inconvenience  from having his corns squeezed by the impatient pony.
    As Whisker was tired of standing, and Mr Swiveller was kind enough to  stimulate him by shrill whistles, and various sporting cries, they  rattled off at too sharp a pace to admit of much conversation:  especially as the pony, incensed by Mr Swiveller's admonitions, took a  particular fancy for the lamp-posts and cart-wheels, and evinced a  strong desire to run on the pavement and rasp himself against the brick  walls.
  It was not, therefore, until they had arrived at the stable,  and the chaise had been extricated from a very small doorway, into  which the pony dragged it under the impression that he could take it  along with him into his usual stall, that Mr Swiveller found time to  talk.
    'It's hard work,' said Richard.
  'What do you say to some beer?'    Kit at first declined, but presently consented, and they adjourned to  the neighbouring bar together.
    'We'll drink our friend what's-his-name,' said Dick, holding up the  bright frothy pot; '--that was talking to you this morning, you know--I  know him--a good fellow, but eccentric--very--here's what's-his-name!'    Kit pledged him.
    'He lives in my house,' said Dick; 'at least in the house occupied by  the firm in which I'm a sort of a--of a managing partner--a difficult  fellow to get anything out of, but we like him--we like him.
'    'I must be going, sir, if you please,' said Kit, moving away.
    'Don't be in a hurry, Christopher,' replied his patron, 'we'll drink  your mother.
'    'Thank you, sir.
'    'An excellent woman that mother of yours, Christopher,' said Mr  Swiveller.
  'Who ran to catch me when I fell, and kissed the place to  make it well?  My mother.
  A charming woman.
  He's a liberal sort of  fellow.
  We must get him to do something for your mother.
  Does he know  her, Christopher?'    Kit shook his head, and glancing slyly at his questioner, thanked him,  and made off before he could say another word.
    'Humph!' said Mr Swiveller pondering, 'this is queer.
  Nothing but  mysteries in connection with Brass's house.
  I'll keep my own counsel,  however.
  Everybody and anybody has been in my confidence as yet, but  now I think I'll set up in business for myself.
  Queer--very queer!'    After pondering deeply and with a face of exceeding wisdom for some  time, Mr Swiveller drank some more of the beer, and summoning a small  boy who had been watching his proceedings, poured forth the few  remaining drops as a libation on the gravel, and bade him carry the  empty vessel to the bar with his compliments, and above all things to  lead a sober and temperate life, and abstain from all intoxicating and  exciting liquors.
  Having given him this piece of moral advice for his  trouble (which, as he wisely observed, was far better than half-pence)  the Perpetual Grand Master of the Glorious Apollos thrust his hands  into his pockets and sauntered away: still pondering as he went.
              All that day, though he waited for Mr Abel until evening, Kit kept  clear of his mother's house, determined not to anticipate the pleasures  of the morrow, but to let them come in their full rush of delight; for  to-morrow was the great and long looked-for epoch in his  life--to-morrow was the end of his first quarter--the day of receiving,  for the first time, one fourth part of his annual income of Six Pounds  in one vast sum of Thirty Shillings--to-morrow was to be a half-holiday  devoted to a whirl of entertainments, and little Jacob was to know what  oysters meant, and to see a play.
    All manner of incidents combined in favour of the occasion: not only  had Mr and Mrs Garland forewarned him that they intended to make no  deduction for his outfit from the great amount, but to pay it him  unbroken in all its gigantic grandeur; not only had the unknown  gentleman increased the stock by the sum of five shillings, which was a  perfect god-send and in itself a fortune; not only had these things  come to pass which nobody could have calculated upon, or in their  wildest dreams have hoped; but it was Barbara's quarter too--Barbara's  quarter, that very day--and Barbara had a half-holiday as well as Kit,  and Barbara's mother was going to make one of the party, and to take  tea with Kit's mother, and cultivate her acquaintance.
    To be sure Kit looked out of his window very early that morning to see  which way the clouds were flying, and to be sure Barbara would have  been at hers too, if she had not sat up so late over-night, starching  and ironing small pieces of muslin, and crimping them into frills, and  sewing them on to other pieces to form magnificent wholes for next  day's wear.
  But they were both up very early for all that, and had  small appetites for breakfast and less for dinner, and were in a state  of great excitement when Barbara's mother came in, with astonishing  accounts of the fineness of the weather out of doors (but with a very  large umbrella notwithstanding, for people like Barbara's mother seldom  make holiday without one), and when the bell rang for them to go up  stairs and receive their quarter's money in gold and silver.
    Well, wasn't Mr Garland kind when he said 'Christopher, here's your  money, and you have earned it well;' and wasn't Mrs Garland kind when  she said 'Barbara, here's yours, and I'm much pleased with you;' and  didn't Kit sign his name bold to his receipt, and didn't Barbara sign  her name all a trembling to hers; and wasn't it beautiful to see how  Mrs Garland poured out Barbara's mother a glass of wine; and didn't  Barbara's mother speak up when she said 'Here's blessing you, ma'am, as  a good lady, and you, sir, as a good gentleman, and Barbara, my love to  you, and here's towards you, Mr Christopher;' and wasn't she as long  drinking it as if it had been a tumblerful; and didn't she look  genteel, standing there with her gloves on; and wasn't there plenty of  laughing and talking among them as they reviewed all these things upon  the top of the coach, and didn't they pity the people who hadn't got a  holiday!    But Kit's mother, again--wouldn't anybody have supposed she had come of  a good stock and been a lady all her life!  There she was, quite ready  to receive them, with a display of tea-things that might have warmed  the heart of a china-shop; and little Jacob and the baby in such a  state of perfection that their clothes looked as good as new, though  Heaven knows they were old enough!  Didn't she say before they had sat  down five minutes that Barbara's mother was exactly the sort of lady  she expected, and didn't Barbara's mother say that Kit's mother was the  very picture of what she had expected, and didn't Kit's mother  compliment Barbara's mother on Barbara, and didn't Barbara's mother  compliment Kit's mother on Kit, and wasn't Barbara herself quite  fascinated with little Jacob, and did ever a child show off when he was  wanted, as that child did, or make such friends as he made!    'And we are both widows too!' said Barbara's mother.
  'We must have  been made to know each other.
'    'I haven't a doubt about it,' returned Mrs Nubbles.
  'And what a pity  it is we didn't know each other sooner.
'    'But then, you know, it's such a pleasure,' said Barbara's mother, 'to  have it brought about by one's son and daughter, that it's fully made  up for.
  Now, an't it?'    To this, Kit's mother yielded her full assent, and tracing things back  from effects to causes, they naturally reverted to their deceased  husbands, respecting whose lives, deaths, and burials, they compared  notes, and discovered sundry circumstances that tallied with wonderful  exactness; such as Barbara's father having been exactly four years and  ten months older than Kit's father, and one of them having died on a  Wednesday and the other on a Thursday, and both of them having been of  a very fine make and remarkably good-looking, with other extraordinary  coincidences.
  These recollections being of a kind calculated to cast a  shadow on the brightness of the holiday, Kit diverted the conversation  to general topics, and they were soon in great force again, and as  merry as before.
  Among other things, Kit told them about his old  place, and the extraordinary beauty of Nell (of whom he had talked to  Barbara a thousand times already); but the last-named circumstance  failed to interest his hearers to anything like the extent he had  supposed, and even his mother said (looking accidentally at Barbara at  the same time) that there was no doubt Miss Nell was very pretty, but  she was but a child after all, and there were many young women quite as  pretty as she; and Barbara mildly observed that she should think so,  and that she never could help believing Mr Christopher must be under a  mistake--which Kit wondered at very much, not being able to conceive  what reason she had for doubting him.
  Barbara's mother too, observed  that it was very common for young folks to change at about fourteen or  fifteen, and whereas they had been very pretty before, to grow up quite  plain; which truth she illustrated by many forcible examples,  especially one of a young man, who, being a builder with great  prospects, had been particular in his attentions to Barbara, but whom  Barbara would have nothing to say to; which (though everything happened  for the best) she almost thought was a pity.
  Kit said he thought so  too, and so he did honestly, and he wondered what made Barbara so  silent all at once, and why his mother looked at him as if he shouldn't  have said it.
    However, it was high time now to be thinking of the play; for which  great preparation was required, in the way of shawls and bonnets, not  to mention one handkerchief full of oranges and another of apples,  which took some time tying up, in consequence of the fruit having a  tendency to roll out at the corners.
  At length, everything was ready,  and they went off very fast; Kit's mother carrying the baby, who was  dreadfully wide awake, and Kit holding little Jacob in one hand, and  escorting Barbara with the other--a state of things which occasioned  the two mothers, who walked behind, to declare that they looked quite  family folks, and caused Barbara to blush and say, 'Now don't, mother!'  But Kit said she had no call to mind what they said; and indeed she  need not have had, if she had known how very far from Kit's thoughts  any love-making was.
  Poor Barbara!    At last they got to the theatre, which was Astley's: and in some two  minutes after they had reached the yet unopened door, little Jacob was  squeezed flat, and the baby had received divers concussions, and  Barbara's mother's umbrella had been carried several yards off and  passed back to her over the shoulders of the people, and Kit had hit a  man on the head with the handkerchief of apples for 'scrowdging' his  parent with unnecessary violence, and there was a great uproar.
  But,  when they were once past the pay-place and tearing away for very life  with their checks in their hands, and, above all, when they were fairly  in the theatre, and seated in such places that they couldn't have had  better if they had picked them out, and taken them beforehand, all this  was looked upon as quite a capital joke, and an essential part of the  entertainment.
    Dear, dear, what a place it looked, that Astley's; with all the paint,  gilding, and looking-glass; the vague smell of horses suggestive of  coming wonders; the curtain that hid such gorgeous mysteries; the clean  white sawdust down in the circus; the company coming in and taking  their places; the fiddlers looking carelessly up at them while they  tuned their instruments, as if they didn't want the play to begin, and  knew it all beforehand!  What a glow was that, which burst upon them  all, when that long, clear, brilliant row of lights came slowly up; and  what the feverish excitement when the little bell rang and the music  began in good earnest, with strong parts for the drums, and sweet  effects for the triangles!  Well might Barbara's mother say to Kit's  mother that the gallery was the place to see from, and wonder it wasn't  much dearer than the boxes; well might Barbara feel doubtful whether to  laugh or cry, in her flutter of delight.
    Then the play itself! the horses which little Jacob believed from the  first to be alive, and the ladies and gentlemen of whose reality he  could be by no means persuaded, having never seen or heard anything at  all like them--the firing, which made Barbara wink--the forlorn lady,  who made her cry--the tyrant, who made her tremble--the man who sang  the song with the lady's-maid and danced the chorus, who made her  laugh--the pony who reared up on his hind legs when he saw the  murderer, and wouldn't hear of walking on all fours again until he was  taken into custody--the clown who ventured on such familiarities with  the military man in boots--the lady who jumped over the nine-and-twenty  ribbons and came down safe upon the horse's back--everything was  delightful, splendid, and surprising!  Little Jacob applauded till his  hands were sore; Kit cried 'an-kor' at the end of everything, the  three-act piece included; and Barbara's mother beat her umbrella on the  floor, in her ecstasies, until it was nearly worn down to the gingham.
    In the midst of all these fascinations, Barbara's thoughts seemed to  have been still running on what Kit had said at tea-time; for, when  they were coming out of the play, she asked him, with an hysterical  simper, if Miss Nell was as handsome as the lady who jumped over the  ribbons.
    'As handsome as her?' said Kit.
  'Double as handsome.
'    'Oh Christopher! I'm sure she was the beautifullest creature ever was,'  said Barbara.
    'Nonsense!' returned Kit.
  'She was well enough, I don't deny that; but  think how she was dressed and painted, and what a difference that made.
  Why YOU are a good deal better looking than her, Barbara.
'    'Oh Christopher!' said Barbara, looking down.
    'You are, any day,' said Kit, '--and so's your mother.
'    Poor Barbara!    What was all this though--even all this--to the extraordinary  dissipation that ensued, when Kit, walking into an oyster-shop as bold  as if he lived there, and not so much as looking at the counter or the  man behind it, led his party into a box--a private box, fitted up with  red curtains, white table-cloth, and cruet-stand complete--and ordered  a fierce gentleman with whiskers, who acted as waiter and called him,  him Christopher Nubbles, 'sir,' to bring three dozen of his  largest-sized oysters, and to look sharp about it!  Yes, Kit told this  gentleman to look sharp, and he not only said he would look sharp, but  he actually did, and presently came running back with the newest  loaves, and the freshest butter, and the largest oysters, ever seen.
  Then said Kit to this gentleman, 'a pot of beer'--just so--and the  gentleman, instead of replying, 'Sir, did you address that language to  me?' only said, 'Pot o' beer, sir?  Yes, sir,' and went off and fetched  it, and put it on the table in a small decanter-stand, like those which  blind-men's dogs carry about the streets in their mouths, to catch the  half-pence in; and both Kit's mother and Barbara's mother declared as  he turned away that he was one of the slimmest and gracefullest young  men she had ever looked upon.
    Then they fell to work upon the supper in earnest; and there was  Barbara, that foolish Barbara, declaring that she could not eat more  than two, and wanting more pressing than you would believe before she  would eat four: though her mother and Kit's mother made up for it  pretty well, and ate and laughed and enjoyed themselves so thoroughly  that it did Kit good to see them, and made him laugh and eat likewise  from strong sympathy.
  But the greatest miracle of the night was little  Jacob, who ate oysters as if he had been born and bred to the  business--sprinkled the pepper and the vinegar with a discretion beyond  his years--and afterwards built a grotto on the table with the shells.
  There was the baby too, who had never closed an eye all night, but had  sat as good as gold, trying to force a large orange into his mouth, and  gazing intently at the lights in the chandelier--there he was, sitting  up in his mother's lap, staring at the gas without winking, and making  indentations in his soft visage with an oyster-shell, to that degree  that a heart of iron must have loved him!  In short, there never was a  more successful supper; and when Kit ordered in a glass of something  hot to finish with, and proposed Mr and Mrs Garland before sending it  round, there were not six happier people in all the world.
    But all happiness has an end--hence the chief pleasure of its next  beginning--and as it was now growing late, they agreed it was time to  turn their faces homewards.
  So, after going a little out of their way  to see Barbara and Barbara's mother safe to a friend's house where they  were to pass the night, Kit and his mother left them at the door, with  an early appointment for returning to Finchley next morning, and a  great many plans for next quarter's enjoyment.
  Then, Kit took little  Jacob on his back, and giving his arm to his mother, and a kiss to the  baby, they all trudged merrily home together.
              Full of that vague kind of penitence which holidays awaken next  morning, Kit turned out at sunrise, and, with his faith in last night's  enjoyments a little shaken by cool daylight and the return to every-day  duties and occupations, went to meet Barbara and her mother at the  appointed place.
  And being careful not to awaken any of the little  household, who were yet resting from their unusual fatigues, Kit left  his money on the chimney-piece, with an inscription in chalk calling  his mother's attention to the circumstance, and informing her that it  came from her dutiful son; and went his way, with a heart something  heavier than his pockets, but free from any very great oppression  notwithstanding.
    Oh these holidays! why will they leave us some regret?  why cannot we  push them back, only a week or two in our memories, so as to put them  at once at that convenient distance whence they may be regarded either  with a calm indifference or a pleasant effort of recollection! why will  they hang about us, like the flavour of yesterday's wine, suggestive of  headaches and lassitude, and those good intentions for the future,  which, under the earth, form the everlasting pavement of a large  estate, and, upon it, usually endure until dinner-time or thereabouts!    Who will wonder that Barbara had a headache, or that Barbara's mother  was disposed to be cross, or that she slightly underrated Astley's, and  thought the clown was older than they had taken him to be last night?  Kit was not surprised to hear her say so--not he.
  He had already had a  misgiving that the inconstant actors in that dazzling vision had been  doing the same thing the night before last, and would do it again that  night, and the next, and for weeks and months to come, though he would  not be there.
  Such is the difference between yesterday and today.
  We  are all going to the play, or coming home from it.
    However, the Sun himself is weak when he first rises, and gathers  strength and courage as the day gets on.
  By degrees, they began to  recall circumstances more and more pleasant in their nature, until,  what between talking, walking, and laughing, they reached Finchley in  such good heart, that Barbara's mother declared she never felt less  tired or in better spirits.
  And so said Kit.
  Barbara had been silent  all the way, but she said so too.
  Poor little Barbara!  She was very  quiet.
    They were at home in such good time that Kit had rubbed down the pony  and made him as spruce as a race-horse, before Mr Garland came down to  breakfast; which punctual and industrious conduct the old lady, and the  old gentleman, and Mr Abel, highly extolled.
  At his usual hour (or  rather at his usual minute and second, for he was the soul of  punctuality) Mr Abel walked out, to be overtaken by the London coach,  and Kit and the old gentleman went to work in the garden.
    This was not the least pleasant of Kit's employments.
  On a fine day  they were quite a family party; the old lady sitting hard by with her  work-basket on a little table; the old gentleman digging, or pruning,  or clipping about with a large pair of shears, or helping Kit in some  way or other with great assiduity; and Whisker looking on from his  paddock in placid contemplation of them all.
  To-day they were to trim  the grape-vine, so Kit mounted half-way up a short ladder, and began to  snip and hammer away, while the old gentleman, with a great interest in  his proceedings, handed up the nails and shreds of cloth as he wanted  them.
  The old lady and Whisker looked on as usual.
    'Well, Christopher,' said Mr Garland, 'and so you have made a new  friend, eh?'    'I beg your pardon, Sir?' returned Kit, looking down from the ladder.
    'You have made a new friend, I hear from Mr Abel,' said the old  gentleman, 'at the office!'    'Oh!  Yes Sir, yes.
  He behaved very handsome, Sir.
'    'I'm glad to hear it,' returned the old gentlemen with a smile.
  'He is  disposed to behave more handsomely still, though, Christopher.
'    'Indeed, Sir!  It's very kind in him, but I don't want him to, I'm  sure,' said Kit, hammering stoutly at an obdurate nail.
    'He is rather anxious,' pursued the old gentleman, 'to have you in his  own service--take care what you're doing, or you will fall down and  hurt yourself.
'    'To have me in his service, Sir?' cried Kit, who had stopped short in  his work and faced about on the ladder like some dexterous tumbler.
  'Why, Sir, I don't think he can be in earnest when he says that.
'    'Oh!  But he is indeed,' said Mr Garland.
  'And he has told Mr Abel so.
'    'I never heard of such a thing!' muttered Kit, looking ruefully at his  master and mistress.
  'I wonder at him; that I do.
'    'You see, Christopher,' said Mr Garland, 'this is a point of much  importance to you, and you should understand and consider it in that  light.
  This gentleman is able to give you more money than I--not, I  hope, to carry through the various relations of master and servant,  more kindness and confidence, but certainly, Christopher, to give you  more money.
'    'Well,' said Kit, 'after that, Sir--'    'Wait a moment,' interposed Mr Garland.
  'That is not all.
  You were a  very faithful servant to your old employers, as I understand, and  should this gentleman recover them, as it is his purpose to attempt  doing by every means in his power, I have no doubt that you, being in  his service, would meet with your reward.
  Besides,' added the old  gentleman with stronger emphasis, 'besides having the pleasure of being  again brought into communication with those to whom you seem to be very  strongly and disinterestedly attached.
  You must think of all this,  Christopher, and not be rash or hasty in your choice.
'    Kit did suffer one twinge, one momentary pang, in keeping the  resolution he had already formed, when this last argument passed  swiftly into his thoughts, and conjured up the realization of all his  hopes and fancies.
  But it was gone in a minute, and he sturdily  rejoined that the gentleman must look out for somebody else, as he did  think he might have done at first.
    'He has no right to think that I'd be led away to go to him, sir,' said  Kit, turning round again after half a minute's hammering.
  'Does he  think I'm a fool?'    'He may, perhaps, Christopher, if you refuse his offer,' said Mr  Garland gravely.
    'Then let him, sir,' retorted Kit; 'what do I care, sir, what he  thinks?  why should I care for his thinking, sir, when I know that I  should be a fool, and worse than a fool, sir, to leave the kindest  master and mistress that ever was or can be, who took me out of the  streets a very poor and hungry lad indeed--poorer and hungrier perhaps  than even you think for, sir--to go to him or anybody?  If Miss Nell  was to come back, ma'am,' added Kit, turning suddenly to his mistress,  'why that would be another thing, and perhaps if she wanted me, I might  ask you now and then to let me work for her when all was done at home.
  But when she comes back, I see now that she'll be rich as old master  always said she would, and being a rich young lady, what could she want  of me?  No, no,' added Kit, shaking his head sorrowfully, 'she'll never  want me any more, and bless her, I hope she never may, though I should  like to see her too!'    Here Kit drove a nail into the wall, very hard--much harder than was  necessary--and having done so, faced about again.
    'There's the pony, sir,' said Kit--'Whisker, ma'am (and he knows so  well I'm talking about him that he begins to neigh directly,  Sir)--would he let anybody come near him but me, ma'am?  Here's the  garden, sir, and Mr Abel, ma'am.
  Would Mr Abel part with me, Sir, or  is there anybody that could be fonder of the garden, ma'am?  It would  break mother's heart, Sir, and even little Jacob would have sense  enough to cry his eyes out, ma'am, if he thought that Mr Abel could  wish to part with me so soon, after having told me, only the other day,  that he hoped we might be together for years to come--'    There is no telling how long Kit might have stood upon the ladder,  addressing his master and mistress by turns, and generally turning  towards the wrong person, if Barbara had not at that moment come  running up to say that a messenger from the office had brought a note,  which, with an expression of some surprise at Kit's oratorical  appearance, she put into her master's hand.
    'Oh!' said the old gentleman after reading it, 'ask the messenger to  walk this way.
'  Barbara tripping off to do as she was bid, he turned  to Kit and said that they would not pursue the subject any further, and  that Kit could not be more unwilling to part with them, than they would  be to part with Kit; a sentiment which the old lady very generously  echoed.
    'At the same time, Christopher,' added Mr Garland, glancing at the note  in his hand, 'if the gentleman should want to borrow you now and then  for an hour or so, or even a day or so, at a time, we must consent to  lend you, and you must consent to be lent.
--Oh! here is the young  gentleman.
  How do you do, Sir?'    This salutation was addressed to Mr Chuckster, who, with his hat  extremely on one side, and his hair a long way beyond it, came  swaggering up the walk.
    'Hope I see you well sir,' returned that gentleman.
  'Hope I see YOU  well, ma'am.
  Charming box this, sir.
  Delicious country to be sure.
'    'You want to take Kit back with you, I find?' observed Mr Garland.
    'I have got a chariot-cab waiting on purpose,' replied the clerk.
  'A  very spanking grey in that cab, sir, if you're a judge of horse-flesh.
'    Declining to inspect the spanking grey, on the plea that he was but  poorly acquainted with such matters, and would but imperfectly  appreciate his beauties, Mr Garland invited Mr Chuckster to partake of  a slight repast in the way of lunch.
  That gentleman readily  consenting, certain cold viands, flanked with ale and wine, were  speedily prepared for his refreshment.
    At this repast, Mr Chuckster exerted his utmost abilities to enchant  his entertainers, and impress them with a conviction of the mental  superiority of those who dwelt in town; with which view he led the  discourse to the small scandal of the day, in which he was justly  considered by his friends to shine prodigiously.
  Thus, he was in a  condition to relate the exact circumstances of the difference between  the Marquis of Mizzler and Lord Bobby, which it appeared originated in  a disputed bottle of champagne, and not in a pigeon-pie, as erroneously  reported in the newspapers; neither had Lord Bobby said to the Marquis  of Mizzler, 'Mizzler, one of us two tells a lie, and I'm not the man,'  as incorrectly stated by the same authorities; but 'Mizzler, you know  where I'm to be found, and damme, sir, find me if you want me'--which,  of course, entirely changed the aspect of this interesting question,  and placed it in a very different light.
  He also acquainted them with  the precise amount of the income guaranteed by the Duke of Thigsberry  to Violetta Stetta of the Italian Opera, which it appeared was payable  quarterly, and not half-yearly, as the public had been given to  understand, and which was EXclusive, and not INclusive (as had been  monstrously stated,) of jewellery, perfumery, hair-powder for five  footmen, and two daily changes of kid-gloves for a page.
  Having  entreated the old lady and gentleman to set their minds at rest on  these absorbing points, for they might rely on his statement being the  correct one, Mr Chuckster entertained them with theatrical chit-chat  and the court circular; and so wound up a brilliant and fascinating  conversation which he had maintained alone, and without any assistance  whatever, for upwards of three-quarters of an hour.
    'And now that the nag has got his wind again,' said Mr Chuckster rising  in a graceful manner, 'I'm afraid I must cut my stick.
'    Neither Mr nor Mrs Garland offered any opposition to his tearing  himself away (feeling, no doubt, that such a man could ill be spared  from his proper sphere of action), and therefore Mr Chuckster and Kit  were shortly afterwards upon their way to town; Kit being perched upon  the box of the cabriolet beside the driver, and Mr Chuckster seated in  solitary state inside, with one of his boots sticking out at each of  the front windows.
    When they reached the Notary's house, Kit followed into the office, and  was desired by Mr Abel to sit down and wait, for the gentleman who  wanted him had gone out, and perhaps might not return for some time.
  This anticipation was strictly verified, for Kit had had his dinner,  and his tea, and had read all the lighter matter in the Law-List, and  the Post-Office Directory, and had fallen asleep a great many times,  before the gentleman whom he had seen before, came in; which he did at  last in a very great hurry.
    He was closeted with Mr Witherden for some little time, and Mr Abel had  been called in to assist at the conference, before Kit, wondering very  much what he was wanted for, was summoned to attend them.
    'Christopher,' said the gentleman, turning to him directly he entered  the room, 'I have found your old master and young mistress.
'    'No, Sir!  Have you, though?' returned Kit, his eyes sparkling with  delight.
  'Where are they, Sir?  How are they, Sir?  Are they--are they  near here?'    'A long way from here,' returned the gentleman, shaking his head.
  'But  I am going away to-night to bring them back, and I want you to go with  me.
'    'Me, Sir?' cried Kit, full of joy and surprise.
    'The place,' said the strange gentleman, turning thoughtfully to the  Notary, 'indicated by this man of the dogs, is--how far from  here--sixty miles?'    'From sixty to seventy.
'    'Humph!  If we travel post all night, we shall reach there in good time  to-morrow morning.
  Now, the only question is, as they will not know  me, and the child, God bless her, would think that any stranger  pursuing them had a design upon her grandfather's liberty--can I do  better than take this lad, whom they both know and will readily  remember, as an assurance to them of my friendly intentions?'    'Certainly not,' replied the Notary.
  'Take Christopher by all means.
'    'I beg your pardon, Sir,' said Kit, who had listened to this discourse  with a lengthening countenance, 'but if that's the reason, I'm afraid I  should do more harm than good--Miss Nell, Sir, she knows me, and would  trust in me, I am sure; but old master--I don't know why, gentlemen;  nobody does--would not bear me in his sight after he had been ill, and  Miss Nell herself told me that I must not go near him or let him see me  any more.
  I should spoil all that you were doing if I went, I'm  afraid.
  I'd give the world to go, but you had better not take me, Sir.
'    'Another difficulty!' cried the impetuous gentleman.
  'Was ever man so  beset as I?  Is there nobody else that knew them, nobody else in whom  they had any confidence?  Solitary as their lives were, is there no one  person who would serve my purpose?'    'IS there, Christopher?' said the Notary.
    'Not one, Sir,' replied Kit.
--'Yes, though--there's my mother.
'    'Did they know her?' said the single gentleman.
    'Know her, Sir! why, she was always coming backwards and forwards.
  They were as kind to her as they were to me.
  Bless you, Sir, she  expected they'd come back to her house.
'    'Then where the devil is the woman?' said the impatient gentleman,  catching up his hat.
  'Why isn't she here?  Why is that woman always  out of the way when she is most wanted?'    In a word, the single gentleman was bursting out of the office, bent  upon laying violent hands on Kit's mother, forcing her into a  post-chaise, and carrying her off, when this novel kind of abduction  was with some difficulty prevented by the joint efforts of Mr Abel and  the Notary, who restrained him by dint of their remonstrances, and  persuaded him to sound Kit upon the probability of her being able and  willing to undertake such a journey on so short a notice.
    This occasioned some doubts on the part of Kit, and some violent  demonstrations on that of the single gentleman, and a great many  soothing speeches on that of the Notary and Mr Abel.
  The upshot of the  business was, that Kit, after weighing the matter in his mind and  considering it carefully, promised, on behalf of his mother, that she  should be ready within two hours from that time to undertake the  expedition, and engaged to produce her in that place, in all respects  equipped and prepared for the journey, before the specified period had  expired.
    Having given this pledge, which was rather a bold one, and not  particularly easy of redemption, Kit lost no time in sallying forth,  and taking measures for its immediate fulfilment.
              Kit made his way through the crowded streets, dividing the stream of  people, dashing across the busy road-ways, diving into lanes and  alleys, and stopping or turning aside for nothing, until he came in  front of the Old Curiosity Shop, when he came to a stand; partly from  habit and partly from being out of breath.
    It was a gloomy autumn evening, and he thought the old place had never  looked so dismal as in its dreary twilight.
  The windows broken, the  rusty sashes rattling in their frames, the deserted house a dull  barrier dividing the glaring lights and bustle of the street into two  long lines, and standing in the midst, cold, dark, and empty--presented  a cheerless spectacle which mingled harshly with the bright prospects  the boy had been building up for its late inmates, and came like a  disappointment or misfortune.
  Kit would have had a good fire roaring  up the empty chimneys, lights sparkling and shining through the  windows, people moving briskly to and fro, voices in cheerful  conversation, something in unison with the new hopes that were astir.
  He had not expected that the house would wear any different aspect--had  known indeed that it could not--but coming upon it in the midst of  eager thoughts and expectations, it checked the current in its flow,  and darkened it with a mournful shadow.
    Kit, however, fortunately for himself, was not learned enough or  contemplative enough to be troubled with presages of evil afar off,  and, having no mental spectacles to assist his vision in this respect,  saw nothing but the dull house, which jarred uncomfortably upon his  previous thoughts.
  So, almost wishing that he had not passed it,  though hardly knowing why, he hurried on again, making up by his  increased speed for the few moments he had lost.
    'Now, if she should be out,' thought Kit, as he approached the poor  dwelling of his mother, 'and I not able to find her, this impatient  gentleman would be in a pretty taking.
  And sure enough there's no  light, and the door's fast.
  Now, God forgive me for saying so, but if  this is Little Bethel's doing, I wish Little Bethel was--was farther  off,' said Kit checking himself, and knocking at the door.
    A second knock brought no reply from within the house; but caused a  woman over the way to look out and inquire who that was, awanting Mrs  Nubbles.
    'Me,' said Kit.
  'She's at--at Little Bethel, I suppose?'--getting out  the name of the obnoxious conventicle with some reluctance, and laying  a spiteful emphasis upon the words.
    The neighbour nodded assent.
    'Then pray tell me where it is,' said Kit, 'for I have come on a  pressing matter, and must fetch her out, even if she was in the pulpit.
'    It was not very easy to procure a direction to the fold in question, as  none of the neighbours were of the flock that resorted thither, and few  knew anything more of it than the name.
  At last, a gossip of Mrs  Nubbles's, who had accompanied her to chapel on one or two occasions  when a comfortable cup of tea had preceded her devotions, furnished the  needful information, which Kit had no sooner obtained than he started  off again.
    Little Bethel might have been nearer, and might have been in a  straighter road, though in that case the reverend gentleman who  presided over its congregation would have lost his favourite allusion  to the crooked ways by which it was approached, and which enabled him  to liken it to Paradise itself, in contradistinction to the parish  church and the broad thoroughfare leading thereunto.
  Kit found it, at  last, after some trouble, and pausing at the door to take breath that  he might enter with becoming decency, passed into the chapel.
    It was not badly named in one respect, being in truth a particularly  little Bethel--a Bethel of the smallest dimensions--with a small  number of small pews, and a small pulpit, in which a small gentleman  (by trade a Shoemaker, and by calling a Divine) was delivering in a by  no means small voice, a by no means small sermon, judging of its  dimensions by the condition of his audience, which, if their gross  amount were but small, comprised a still smaller number of hearers, as  the majority were slumbering.
    Among these was Kit's mother, who, finding it matter of extreme  difficulty to keep her eyes open after the fatigues of last night, and  feeling their inclination to close strongly backed and seconded by the  arguments of the preacher, had yielded to the drowsiness that  overpowered her, and fallen asleep; though not so soundly but that she  could, from time to time, utter a slight and almost inaudible groan, as  if in recognition of the orator's doctrines.
  The baby in her arms was  as fast asleep as she; and little Jacob, whose youth prevented him from  recognising in this prolonged spiritual nourishment anything half as  interesting as oysters, was alternately very fast asleep and very wide  awake, as his inclination to slumber, or his terror of being personally  alluded to in the discourse, gained the mastery over him.
    'And now I'm here,' thought Kit, gliding into the nearest empty pew  which was opposite his mother's, and on the other side of the little  aisle, 'how am I ever to get at her, or persuade her to come out!  I  might as well be twenty miles off.
  She'll never wake till it's all  over, and there goes the clock again!  If he would but leave off for a  minute, or if they'd only sing!'    But there was little encouragement to believe that either event would  happen for a couple of hours to come.
  The preacher went on telling  them what he meant to convince them of before he had done, and it was  clear that if he only kept to one-half of his promises and forgot the  other, he was good for that time at least.
    In his desperation and restlessness Kit cast his eyes about the chapel,  and happening to let them fall upon a little seat in front of the  clerk's desk, could scarcely believe them when they showed him--Quilp!    He rubbed them twice or thrice, but still they insisted that Quilp was  there, and there indeed he was, sitting with his hands upon his knees,  and his hat between them on a little wooden bracket, with the  accustomed grin on his dirty face, and his eyes fixed upon the ceiling.
  He certainly did not glance at Kit or at his mother, and appeared  utterly unconscious of their presence; still Kit could not help  feeling, directly, that the attention of the sly little fiend was  fastened upon them, and upon nothing else.
    But, astounded as he was by the apparition of the dwarf among the  Little Bethelites, and not free from a misgiving that it was the  forerunner of some trouble or annoyance, he was compelled to subdue his  wonder and to take active measures for the withdrawal of his parent, as  the evening was now creeping on, and the matter grew serious.
  Therefore, the next time little Jacob woke, Kit set himself to attract  his wandering attention, and this not being a very difficult task (one  sneeze effected it), he signed to him to rouse his mother.
    Ill-luck would have it, however, that, just then, the preacher, in a  forcible exposition of one head of his discourse, leaned over upon the  pulpit-desk so that very little more of him than his legs remained  inside; and, while he made vehement gestures with his right hand, and  held on with his left, stared, or seemed to stare, straight into little  Jacob's eyes, threatening him by his strained look and attitude--so it  appeared to the child--that if he so much as moved a muscle, he, the  preacher, would be literally, and not figuratively, 'down upon him'  that instant.
  In this fearful state of things, distracted by the  sudden appearance of Kit, and fascinated by the eyes of the preacher,  the miserable Jacob sat bolt upright, wholly incapable of motion,  strongly disposed to cry but afraid to do so, and returning his  pastor's gaze until his infant eyes seemed starting from their sockets.
    'If I must do it openly, I must,' thought Kit.
  With that he walked  softly out of his pew and into his mother's, and as Mr Swiveller would  have observed if he had been present, 'collared' the baby without  speaking a word.
    'Hush, mother!' whispered Kit.
  'Come along with me, I've got something  to tell you.
'    'Where am I?' said Mrs Nubbles.
    'In this blessed Little Bethel,' returned her son, peevishly.
    'Blessed indeed!' cried Mrs Nubbles, catching at the word.
  'Oh,  Christopher, how have I been edified this night!'    'Yes, yes, I know,' said Kit hastily; 'but come along, mother,  everybody's looking at us.
  Don't make a noise--bring Jacob--that's  right!'    'Stay, Satan, stay!' cried the preacher, as Kit was moving off.
      'This gentleman says you're to stay, Christopher,' whispered his mother.
    'Stay, Satan, stay!' roared the preacher again.
  'Tempt not the woman  that doth incline her ear to thee, but harken to the voice of him that  calleth.
  He hath a lamb from the fold!' cried the preacher, raising  his voice still higher and pointing to the baby.
  'He beareth off a  lamb, a precious lamb!  He goeth about, like a wolf in the night  season, and inveigleth the tender lambs!'    Kit was the best-tempered fellow in the world, but considering this  strong language, and being somewhat excited by the circumstances in  which he was placed, he faced round to the pulpit with the baby in his  arms, and replied aloud, 'No, I don't.
  He's my brother.
'    'He's MY brother!' cried the preacher.
    'He isn't,' said Kit indignantly.
  'How can you say such a thing?  And  don't call me names if you please; what harm have I done?  I shouldn't  have come to take 'em away, unless I was obliged, you may depend upon  that.
  I wanted to do it very quiet, but you wouldn't let me.
  Now, you  have the goodness to abuse Satan and them, as much as you like, Sir,  and to let me alone if you please.
'    So saying, Kit marched out of the chapel, followed by his mother and  little Jacob, and found himself in the open air, with an indistinct  recollection of having seen the people wake up and look surprised, and  of Quilp having remained, throughout the interruption, in his old  attitude, without moving his eyes from the ceiling, or appearing to  take the smallest notice of anything that passed.
    'Oh Kit!' said his mother, with her handkerchief to her eyes, 'what  have you done!  I never can go there again--never!'    'I'm glad of it, mother.
  What was there in the little bit of pleasure  you took last night that made it necessary for you to be low-spirited  and sorrowful tonight?  That's the way you do.
  If you're happy or  merry ever, you come here to say, along with that chap, that you're  sorry for it.
  More shame for you, mother, I was going to say.
'    'Hush, dear!' said Mrs Nubbles; 'you don't mean what you say I know,  but you're talking sinfulness.
'    'Don't mean it?  But I do mean it!' retorted Kit.
  'I don't believe,  mother, that harmless cheerfulness and good humour are thought greater  sins in Heaven than shirt-collars are, and I do believe that those  chaps are just about as right and sensible in putting down the one as  in leaving off the other--that's my belief.
  But I won't say anything  more about it, if you'll promise not to cry, that's all; and you take  the baby that's a lighter weight, and give me little Jacob; and as we  go along (which we must do pretty quick) I'll give you the news I  bring, which will surprise you a little, I can tell you.
  There--that's  right.
  Now you look as if you'd never seen Little Bethel in all your  life, as I hope you never will again; and here's the baby; and little  Jacob, you get atop of my back and catch hold of me tight round the  neck, and whenever a Little Bethel parson calls you a precious lamb or  says your brother's one, you tell him it's the truest things he's said  for a twelvemonth, and that if he'd got a little more of the lamb  himself, and less of the mint-sauce--not being quite so sharp and sour  over it--I should like him all the better.
  That's what you've got to  say to him, Jacob.
'    Talking on in this way, half in jest and half in earnest, and cheering  up his mother, the children, and himself, by the one simple process of  determining to be in a good humour, Kit led them briskly forward; and  on the road home, he related what had passed at the Notary's house, and  the purpose with which he had intruded on the solemnities of Little  Bethel.
    His mother was not a little startled on learning what service was  required of her, and presently fell into a confusion of ideas, of which  the most prominent were that it was a great honour and dignity to ride  in a post-chaise, and that it was a moral impossibility to leave the  children behind.
  But this objection, and a great many others, founded  on certain articles of dress being at the wash, and certain other  articles having no existence in the wardrobe of Mrs Nubbles, were  overcome by Kit, who opposed to each and every of them, the pleasure of  recovering Nell, and the delight it would be to bring her back in  triumph.
    'There's only ten minutes now, mother,' said Kit when they reached  home.
  'There's a bandbox.
  Throw in what you want, and we'll be off  directly.
'    To tell how Kit then hustled into the box all sorts of things which  could, by no remote contingency, be wanted, and how he left out  everything likely to be of the smallest use; how a neighbour was  persuaded to come and stop with the children, and how the children at  first cried dismally, and then laughed heartily on being promised all  kinds of impossible and unheard-of toys; how Kit's mother wouldn't  leave off kissing them, and how Kit couldn't make up his mind to be  vexed with her for doing it; would take more time and room than you and  I can spare.
  So, passing over all such matters, it is sufficient to  say that within a few minutes after the two hours had expired, Kit and  his mother arrived at the Notary's door, where a post-chaise was  already waiting.
    'With four horses I declare!' said Kit, quite aghast at the  preparations.
  'Well you ARE going to do it, mother!  Here she is, Sir.
  Here's my mother.
  She's quite ready, sir.
'    'That's well,' returned the gentleman.
  'Now, don't be in a flutter,  ma'am; you'll be taken great care of.
  Where's the box with the new  clothing and necessaries for them?'    'Here it is,' said the Notary.
  'In with it, Christopher.
'    'All right, Sir,' replied Kit.
  'Quite ready now, sir.
'    'Then come along,' said the single gentleman.
  And thereupon he gave  his arm to Kit's mother, handed her into the carriage as politely as  you please, and took his seat beside her.
    Up went the steps, bang went the door, round whirled the wheels, and  off they rattled, with Kit's mother hanging out at one window waving a  damp pocket-handkerchief and screaming out a great many messages to  little Jacob and the baby, of which nobody heard a word.
    Kit stood in the middle of the road, and looked after them with tears  in his eyes--not brought there by the departure he witnessed, but by  the return to which he looked forward.
  'They went away,' he thought,  'on foot with nobody to speak to them or say a kind word at parting,  and they'll come back, drawn by four horses, with this rich gentleman  for their friend, and all their troubles over!  She'll forget that she  taught me to write--'    Whatever Kit thought about after this, took some time to think of, for  he stood gazing up the lines of shining lamps, long after the chaise  had disappeared, and did not return into the house until the Notary and  Mr Abel, who had themselves lingered outside till the sound of the  wheels was no longer distinguishable, had several times wondered what  could possibly detain him.
              It behoves us to leave Kit for a while, thoughtful and expectant, and  to follow the fortunes of little Nell; resuming the thread of the  narrative at the point where it was left, some chapters back.
    In one of those wanderings in the evening time, when, following the two  sisters at a humble distance, she felt, in her sympathy with them and  her recognition in their trials of something akin to her own loneliness  of spirit, a comfort and consolation which made such moments a time of  deep delight, though the softened pleasure they yielded was of that  kind which lives and dies in tears--in one of those wanderings at the  quiet hour of twilight, when sky, and earth, and air, and rippling  water, and sound of distant bells, claimed kindred with the emotions of  the solitary child, and inspired her with soothing thoughts, but not of  a child's world or its easy joys--in one of those rambles which had now  become her only pleasure or relief from care, light had faded into  darkness and evening deepened into night, and still the young creature  lingered in the gloom; feeling a companionship in Nature so serene and  still, when noise of tongues and glare of garish lights would have been  solitude indeed.
    The sisters had gone home, and she was alone.
  She raised her eyes to  the bright stars, looking down so mildly from the wide worlds of air,  and, gazing on them, found new stars burst upon her view, and more  beyond, and more beyond again, until the whole great expanse sparkled  with shining spheres, rising higher and higher in immeasurable space,  eternal in their numbers as in their changeless and incorruptible  existence.
  She bent over the calm river, and saw them shining in the  same majestic order as when the dove beheld them gleaming through the  swollen waters, upon the mountain tops down far below, and dead  mankind, a million fathoms deep.
    The child sat silently beneath a tree, hushed in her very breath by the  stillness of the night, and all its attendant wonders.
  The time and  place awoke reflection, and she thought with a quiet hope--less hope,  perhaps, than resignation--on the past, and present, and what was yet  before her.
  Between the old man and herself there had come a gradual  separation, harder to bear than any former sorrow.
  Every evening, and  often in the day-time too, he was absent, alone; and although she well  knew where he went, and why--too well from the constant drain upon her  scanty purse and from his haggard looks--he evaded all inquiry,  maintained a strict reserve, and even shunned her presence.
    She sat meditating sorrowfully upon this change, and mingling it, as it  were, with everything about her, when the distant church-clock bell  struck nine.
  Rising at the sound, she retraced her steps, and turned  thoughtfully towards the town.
    She had gained a little wooden bridge, which, thrown across the stream,  led into a meadow in her way, when she came suddenly upon a ruddy  light, and looking forward more attentively, discerned that it  proceeded from what appeared to be an encampment of gipsies, who had  made a fire in one corner at no great distance from the path, and were  sitting or lying round it.
  As she was too poor to have any fear of  them, she did not alter her course (which, indeed, she could not have  done without going a long way round), but quickened her pace a little,  and kept straight on.
    A movement of timid curiosity impelled her, when she approached the  spot, to glance towards the fire.
  There was a form between it and her,  the outline strongly developed against the light, which caused her to  stop abruptly.
  Then, as if she had reasoned with herself and were  assured that it could not be, or had satisfied herself that it was not  that of the person she had supposed, she went on again.
    But at that instant the conversation, whatever it was, which had been  carrying on near this fire was resumed, and the tones of the voice that  spoke--she could not distinguish words--sounded as familiar to her as  her own.
    She turned, and looked back.
  The person had been seated before, but  was now in a standing posture, and leaning forward on a stick on which  he rested both hands.
  The attitude was no less familiar to her than  the tone of voice had been.
  It was her grandfather.
    Her first impulse was to call to him; her next to wonder who his  associates could be, and for what purpose they were together.
  Some  vague apprehension succeeded, and, yielding to the strong inclination  it awakened, she drew nearer to the place; not advancing across the  open field, however, but creeping towards it by the hedge.
    In this way she advanced within a few feet of the fire, and standing  among a few young trees, could both see and hear, without much danger  of being observed.
    There were no women or children, as she had seen in other gipsy camps  they had passed in their wayfaring, and but one gipsy--a tall athletic  man, who stood with his arms folded, leaning against a tree at a little  distance off, looking now at the fire, and now, under his black  eyelashes, at three other men who were there, with a watchful but  half-concealed interest in their conversation.
  Of these, her  grandfather was one; the others she recognised as the first  card-players at the public-house on the eventful night of the  storm--the man whom they had called Isaac List, and his gruff  companion.
  One of the low, arched gipsy-tents, common to that people,  was pitched hard by, but it either was, or appeared to be, empty.
    'Well, are you going?' said the stout man, looking up from the ground  where he was lying at his ease, into her grandfather's face.
  'You were  in a mighty hurry a minute ago.
  Go, if you like.
  You're your own  master, I hope?'    'Don't vex him,' returned Isaac List, who was squatting like a frog on  the other side of the fire, and had so screwed himself up that he  seemed to be squinting all over; 'he didn't mean any offence.
'    'You keep me poor, and plunder me, and make a sport and jest of me  besides,' said the old man, turning from one to the other.
  'Ye'll  drive me mad among ye.
'    The utter irresolution and feebleness of the grey-haired child,  contrasted with the keen and cunning looks of those in whose hands he  was, smote upon the little listener's heart.
  But she constrained  herself to attend to all that passed, and to note each look and word.
    'Confound you, what do you mean?' said the stout man rising a little,  and supporting himself on his elbow.
  'Keep you poor!  You'd keep us  poor if you could, wouldn't you?  That's the way with you whining,  puny, pitiful players.
  When you lose, you're martyrs; but I don't find  that when you win, you look upon the other losers in that light.
  As to  plunder!' cried the fellow, raising his voice--'Damme, what do you  mean by such ungentlemanly language as plunder, eh?'    The speaker laid himself down again at full length, and gave one or two  short, angry kicks, as if in further expression of his unbounded  indignation.
  It was quite plain that he acted the bully, and his  friend the peacemaker, for some particular purpose; or rather, it would  have been to any one but the weak old man; for they exchanged glances  quite openly, both with each other and with the gipsy, who grinned his  approval of the jest until his white teeth shone again.
    The old man stood helplessly among them for a little time, and then  said, turning to his assailant:    'You yourself were speaking of plunder just now, you know.
  Don't be so  violent with me.
  You were, were you not?'    'Not of plundering among present company!  Honour among--among  gentlemen, Sir,' returned the other, who seemed to have been very near  giving an awkward termination to the sentence.
    'Don't be hard upon him, Jowl,' said Isaac List.
  'He's very sorry for  giving offence.
  There--go on with what you were saying--go on.
'    'I'm a jolly old tender-hearted lamb, I am,' cried Mr Jowl, 'to be  sitting here at my time of life giving advice when I know it won't be  taken, and that I shall get nothing but abuse for my pains.
  But that's  the way I've gone through life.
  Experience has never put a chill upon  my warm-heartedness.
'    'I tell you he's very sorry, don't I?' remonstrated Isaac List, 'and  that he wishes you'd go on.
'    'Does he wish it?' said the other.
    'Ay,' groaned the old man sitting down, and rocking himself to and fro.
  'Go on, go on.
  It's in vain to fight with it; I can't do it; go on.
'    'I go on then,' said Jowl, 'where I left off, when you got up so quick.
  If you're persuaded that it's time for luck to turn, as it certainly  is, and find that you haven't means enough to try it (and that's where  it is, for you know, yourself, that you never have the funds to keep on  long enough at a sitting), help yourself to what seems put in your way  on purpose.
  Borrow it, I say, and, when you're able, pay it back  again.
'    'Certainly,' Isaac List struck in, 'if this good lady as keeps the  wax-works has money, and does keep it in a tin box when she goes to  bed, and doesn't lock her door for fear of fire, it seems a easy thing;  quite a Providence, I should call it--but then I've been religiously  brought up.
'    'You see, Isaac,' said his friend, growing more eager, and drawing  himself closer to the old man, while he signed to the gipsy not to come  between them; 'you see, Isaac, strangers are going in and out every  hour of the day; nothing would be more likely than for one of these  strangers to get under the good lady's bed, or lock himself in the  cupboard; suspicion would be very wide, and would fall a long way from  the mark, no doubt.
  I'd give him his revenge to the last farthing he  brought, whatever the amount was.
'    'But could you?' urged Isaac List.
  'Is your bank strong enough?'    'Strong enough!' answered the other, with assumed disdain.
  'Here, you  Sir, give me that box out of the straw!'    This was addressed to the gipsy, who crawled into the low tent on all  fours, and after some rummaging and rustling returned with a cash-box,  which the man who had spoken opened with a key he wore about his person.
    'Do you see this?' he said, gathering up the money in his hand and  letting it drop back into the box, between his fingers, like water.
  'Do you hear it?  Do you know the sound of gold?  There, put it  back--and don't talk about banks again, Isaac, till you've got one of  your own.
'    Isaac List, with great apparent humility, protested that he had never  doubted the credit of a gentleman so notorious for his honourable  dealing as Mr Jowl, and that he had hinted at the production of the  box, not for the satisfaction of his doubts, for he could have none,  but with a view to being regaled with a sight of so much wealth, which,  though it might be deemed by some but an unsubstantial and visionary  pleasure, was to one in his circumstances a source of extreme delight,  only to be surpassed by its safe depository in his own personal  pockets.
  Although Mr List and Mr Jowl addressed themselves to each  other, it was remarkable that they both looked narrowly at the old man,  who, with his eyes fixed upon the fire, sat brooding over it, yet  listening eagerly--as it seemed from a certain involuntary motion of  the head, or twitching of the face from time to time--to all they said.
    'My advice,' said Jowl, lying down again with a careless air, 'is  plain--I have given it, in fact.
  I act as a friend.
  Why should I help  a man to the means perhaps of winning all I have, unless I considered  him my friend?  It's foolish, I dare say, to be so thoughtful of the  welfare of other people, but that's my constitution, and I can't help  it; so don't blame me, Isaac List.
'    'I blame you!' returned the person addressed; 'not for the world, Mr  Jowl.
  I wish I could afford to be as liberal as you; and, as you say,  he might pay it back if he won--and if he lost--'    'You're not to take that into consideration at all,' said Jowl.
    'But suppose he did (and nothing's less likely, from all I know of  chances), why, it's better to lose other people's money than one's own,  I hope?'    'Ah!' cried Isaac List rapturously, 'the pleasures of winning!  The  delight of picking up the money--the bright, shining yellow-boys--and  sweeping 'em into one's pocket!  The deliciousness of having a triumph  at last, and thinking that one didn't stop short and turn back, but  went half-way to meet it!  The--but you're not going, old gentleman?'    'I'll do it,' said the old man, who had risen and taken two or three  hurried steps away, and now returned as hurriedly.
  'I'll have it,  every penny.
'    'Why, that's brave,' cried Isaac, jumping up and slapping him on the  shoulder; 'and I respect you for having so much young blood left.
  Ha,  ha, ha!  Joe Jowl's half sorry he advised you now.
  We've got the laugh  against him.
  Ha, ha, ha!'    'He gives me my revenge, mind,' said the old man, pointing to him  eagerly with his shrivelled hand: 'mind--he stakes coin against coin,  down to the last one in the box, be there many or few.
  Remember that!'    'I'm witness,' returned Isaac.
  'I'll see fair between you.
'    'I have passed my word,' said Jowl with feigned reluctance, 'and I'll  keep it.
  When does this match come off?  I wish it was over.
--To-night?'    'I must have the money first,' said the old man; 'and that I'll have  to-morrow--'    'Why not to-night?' urged Jowl.
    'It's late now, and I should be flushed and flurried,' said the old  man.
  'It must be softly done.
  No, to-morrow night.
'    'Then to-morrow be it,' said Jowl.
  'A drop of comfort here.
  Luck to  the best man!  Fill!'    The gipsy produced three tin cups, and filled them to the brim with  brandy.
  The old man turned aside and muttered to himself before he  drank.
  Her own name struck upon the listener's ear, coupled with some  wish so fervent, that he seemed to breathe it in an agony of  supplication.
    'God be merciful to us!' cried the child within herself, 'and help us  in this trying hour!  What shall I do to save him!'    The remainder of their conversation was carried on in a lower tone of  voice, and was sufficiently concise; relating merely to the execution  of the project, and the best precautions for diverting suspicion.
  The  old man then shook hands with his tempters, and withdrew.
    They watched his bowed and stooping figure as it retreated slowly, and  when he turned his head to look back, which he often did, waved their  hands, or shouted some brief encouragement.
  It was not until they had  seen him gradually diminish into a mere speck upon the distant road,  that they turned to each other, and ventured to laugh aloud.
    'So,' said Jowl, warming his hands at the fire, 'it's done at last.
  He  wanted more persuading than I expected.
  It's three weeks ago, since we  first put this in his head.
  What'll he bring, do you think?'    'Whatever he brings, it's halved between us,' returned Isaac List.
    The other man nodded.
  'We must make quick work of it,' he said, 'and  then cut his acquaintance, or we may be suspected.
  Sharp's the word.
'    List and the gipsy acquiesced.
  When they had all three amused  themselves a little with their victim's infatuation, they dismissed the  subject as one which had been sufficiently discussed, and began to talk  in a jargon which the child did not understand.
  As their discourse  appeared to relate to matters in which they were warmly interested,  however, she deemed it the best time for escaping unobserved; and crept  away with slow and cautious steps, keeping in the shadow of the hedges,  or forcing a path through them or the dry ditches, until she could  emerge upon the road at a point beyond their range of vision.
  Then she  fled homeward as quickly as she could, torn and bleeding from the  wounds of thorns and briars, but more lacerated in mind, and threw  herself upon her bed, distracted.
    The first idea that flashed upon her mind was flight, instant flight;  dragging him from that place, and rather dying of want upon the  roadside, than ever exposing him again to such terrible temptations.
  Then, she remembered that the crime was not to be committed until next  night, and there was the intermediate time for thinking, and resolving  what to do.
  Then, she was distracted with a horrible fear that he  might be committing it at that moment; with a dread of hearing shrieks  and cries piercing the silence of the night; with fearful thoughts of  what he might be tempted and led on to do, if he were detected in the  act, and had but a woman to struggle with.
  It was impossible to bear  such torture.
  She stole to the room where the money was, opened the  door, and looked in.
  God be praised!  He was not there, and she was  sleeping soundly.
    She went back to her own room, and tried to prepare herself for bed.
  But who could sleep--sleep! who could lie passively down, distracted by  such terrors?  They came upon her more and more strongly yet.
  Half  undressed, and with her hair in wild disorder, she flew to the old  man's bedside, clasped him by the wrist, and roused him from his sleep.
    'What's this!' he cried, starting up in bed, and fixing his eyes upon  her spectral face.
    'I have had a dreadful dream,' said the child, with an energy that  nothing but such terrors could have inspired.
  'A dreadful, horrible  dream.
  I have had it once before.
  It is a dream of grey-haired men  like you, in darkened rooms by night, robbing sleepers of their gold.
  Up, up!'    The old man shook in every joint, and folded his hands like one who  prays.
    'Not to me,' said the child, 'not to me--to Heaven, to save us from  such deeds!  This dream is too real.
  I cannot sleep, I cannot stay  here, I cannot leave you alone under the roof where such dreams come.
  Up!  We must fly.
'    He looked at her as if she were a spirit--she might have been for all  the look of earth she had--and trembled more and more.
    'There is no time to lose; I will not lose one minute,' said the child.
  'Up! and away with me!'    'To-night?' murmured the old man.
    'Yes, to-night,' replied the child.
  'To-morrow night will be too late.
  The dream will have come again.
  Nothing but flight can save us.
  Up!'    The old man rose from his bed: his forehead bedewed with the cold sweat  of fear: and, bending before the child as if she had been an angel  messenger sent to lead him where she would, made ready to follow her.
  She took him by the hand and led him on.
 As they passed the door of the  room he had proposed to rob, she  shuddered and looked up into his  face.
  What a white face was that, and with what a look did he meet  hers!    She took him to her own chamber, and, still holding him by the hand as  if she feared to lose him for an instant, gathered together the little  stock she had, and hung her basket on her arm.
  The old man took his  wallet from her hands and strapped it on his shoulders--his staff,  too, she had brought away--and then she led him forth.
    Through the strait streets, and narrow crooked outskirts, their  trembling feet passed quickly.
  Up the steep hill too, crowned by the  old grey castle, they toiled with rapid steps, and had not once looked  behind.
    But as they drew nearer the ruined walls, the moon rose in all her  gentle glory, and, from their venerable age, garlanded with ivy, moss,  and waving grass, the child looked back upon the sleeping town, deep in  the valley's shade: and on the far-off river with its winding track of  light: and on the distant hills; and as she did so, she clasped the  hand she held, less firmly, and bursting into tears, fell upon the old  man's neck.
              Her momentary weakness past, the child again summoned the resolution  which had until now sustained her, and, endeavouring to keep steadily  in her view the one idea that they were flying from disgrace and crime,  and that her grandfather's preservation must depend solely on her  firmness, unaided by one word of advice or any helping hand, urged him  onward and looked back no more.
    While he, subdued and abashed, seemed to crouch before her, and to  shrink and cower down, as if in the presence of some superior creature,  the child herself was sensible of a new feeling within her, which  elevated her nature, and inspired her with an energy and confidence she  had never known.
  There was no divided responsibility now; the whole  burden of their two lives had fallen upon her, and henceforth she must  think and act for both.
  'I have saved him,' she thought.
  'In all  dangers and distresses, I will remember that.
'    At any other time, the recollection of having deserted the friend who  had shown them so much homely kindness, without a word of  justification--the thought that they were guilty, in appearance, of  treachery and ingratitude--even the having parted from the two  sisters--would have filled her with sorrow and regret.
  But now, all  other considerations were lost in the new uncertainties and anxieties  of their wild and wandering life; and the very desperation of their  condition roused and stimulated her.
    In the pale moonlight, which lent a wanness of its own to the delicate  face where thoughtful care already mingled with the winning grace and  loveliness of youth, the too bright eye, the spiritual head, the lips  that pressed each other with such high resolve and courage of the  heart, the slight figure firm in its bearing and yet so very weak, told  their silent tale; but told it only to the wind that rustled by, which,  taking up its burden, carried, perhaps to some mother's pillow, faint  dreams of childhood fading in its bloom, and resting in the sleep that  knows no waking.
    The night crept on apace, the moon went down, the stars grew pale and  dim, and morning, cold as they, slowly approached.
  Then, from behind a  distant hill, the noble sun rose up, driving the mists in phantom  shapes before it, and clearing the earth of their ghostly forms till  darkness came again.
  When it had climbed higher into the sky, and  there was warmth in its cheerful beams, they laid them down to sleep,  upon a bank, hard by some water.
    But Nell retained her grasp upon the old man's arm, and long after he  was slumbering soundly, watched him with untiring eyes.
  Fatigue stole  over her at last; her grasp relaxed, tightened, relaxed again, and they  slept side by side.
    A confused sound of voices, mingling with her dreams, awoke her.
  A man  of very uncouth and rough appearance was standing over them, and two of  his companions were looking on, from a long heavy boat which had come  close to the bank while they were sleeping.
  The boat had neither oar  nor sail, but was towed by a couple of horses, who, with the rope to  which they were harnessed slack and dripping in the water, were resting  on the path.
    'Holloa!' said the man roughly.
  'What's the matter here?'    'We were only asleep, Sir,' said Nell.
  'We have been walking all  night.
'    'A pair of queer travellers to be walking all night,' observed the man  who had first accosted them.
  'One of you is a trifle too old for that  sort of work, and the other a trifle too young.
  Where are you going?'    Nell faltered, and pointed at hazard towards the West, upon which the  man inquired if she meant a certain town which he named.
  Nell, to  avoid more questioning, said 'Yes, that was the place.
'    'Where have you come from?' was the next question; and this being an  easier one to answer, Nell mentioned the name of the village in which  their friend the schoolmaster dwelt, as being less likely to be known  to the men or to provoke further inquiry.
    'I thought somebody had been robbing and ill-using you, might be,' said  the man.
  'That's all.
  Good day.
'    Returning his salute and feeling greatly relieved by his departure,  Nell looked after him as he mounted one of the horses, and the boat  went on.
  It had not gone very far, when it stopped again, and she saw  the men beckoning to her.
    'Did you call to me?' said Nell, running up to them.
    'You may go with us if you like,' replied one of those in the boat.
  'We're going to the same place.
'    The child hesitated for a moment.
  Thinking, as she had thought with  great trepidation more than once before, that the men whom she had seen  with her grandfather might, perhaps, in their eagerness for the booty,  follow them, and regaining their influence over him, set hers at  nought; and that if they went with these men, all traces of them must  surely be lost at that spot; determined to accept the offer.
  The boat  came close to the bank again, and before she had had any more time for  consideration, she and her grandfather were on board, and gliding  smoothly down the canal.
    The sun shone pleasantly on the bright water, which was sometimes  shaded by trees, and sometimes open to a wide extent of country,  intersected by running streams, and rich with wooded hills, cultivated  land, and sheltered farms.
  Now and then, a village with its modest  spire, thatched roofs, and gable-ends, would peep out from among the  trees; and, more than once, a distant town, with great church towers  looming through its smoke, and high factories or workshops rising above  the mass of houses, would come in view, and, by the length of time it  lingered in the distance, show them how slowly they travelled.
  Their  way lay, for the most part, through the low grounds, and open plains;  and except these distant places, and occasionally some men working in  the fields, or lounging on the bridges under which they passed, to see  them creep along, nothing encroached on their monotonous and secluded  track.
    Nell was rather disheartened, when they stopped at a kind of wharf late  in the afternoon, to learn from one of the men that they would not  reach their place of destination until next day, and that, if she had  no provision with her, she had better buy it there.
  She had but a few  pence, having already bargained with them for some bread, but even of  these it was necessary to be very careful, as they were on their way to  an utterly strange place, with no resource whatever.
  A small loaf and  a morsel of cheese, therefore, were all she could afford, and with  these she took her place in the boat again, and, after half an hour's  delay during which the men were drinking at the public-house, proceeded  on the journey.
    They brought some beer and spirits into the boat with them, and what  with drinking freely before, and again now, were soon in a fair way of  being quarrelsome and intoxicated.
  Avoiding the small cabin,  therefore, which was very dark and filthy, and to which they often  invited both her and her grandfather, Nell sat in the open air with the  old man by her side: listening to their boisterous hosts with a  palpitating heart, and almost wishing herself safe on shore again  though she should have to walk all night.
    They were, in truth, very rugged, noisy fellows, and quite brutal among  themselves, though civil enough to their two passengers.
  Thus, when a  quarrel arose between the man who was steering and his friend in the  cabin, upon the question who had first suggested the propriety of  offering Nell some beer, and when the quarrel led to a scuffle in which  they beat each other fearfully, to her inexpressible terror, neither  visited his displeasure upon her, but each contented himself with  venting it on his adversary, on whom, in addition to blows, he bestowed  a variety of compliments, which, happily for the child, were conveyed  in terms, to her quite unintelligible.
  The difference was finally  adjusted, by the man who had come out of the cabin knocking the other  into it head first, and taking the helm into his own hands, without  evincing the least discomposure himself, or causing any in his friend,  who, being of a tolerably strong constitution and perfectly inured to  such trifles, went to sleep as he was, with his heels upwards, and in a  couple of minutes or so was snoring comfortably.
    By this time it was night again, and though the child felt cold, being  but poorly clad, her anxious thoughts were far removed from her own  suffering or uneasiness, and busily engaged in endeavouring to devise  some scheme for their joint subsistence.
  The same spirit which had  supported her on the previous night, upheld and sustained her now.
  Her  grandfather lay sleeping safely at her side, and the crime to which his  madness urged him, was not committed.
  That was her comfort.
    How every circumstance of her short, eventful life, came thronging into  her mind, as they travelled on!  Slight incidents, never thought of or  remembered until now; faces, seen once and ever since forgotten; words  scarcely heeded at the time; scenes, of a year ago and those of  yesterday, mixing up and linking themselves together; familiar places  shaping themselves out in the darkness from things which, when  approached, were, of all others, the most remote and most unlike them;  sometimes, a strange confusion in her mind relative to the occasion of  her being there, and the place to which she was going, and the people  she was with; and imagination suggesting remarks and questions which  sounded so plainly in her ears, that she would start, and turn, and be  almost tempted to reply;--all the fancies and contradictions common in  watching and excitement and restless change of place, beset the child.
    She happened, while she was thus engaged, to encounter the face of the  man on deck, in whom the sentimental stage of drunkenness had now  succeeded to the boisterous, and who, taking from his mouth a short  pipe, quilted over with string for its longer preservation, requested  that she would oblige him with a song.
    'You've got a very pretty voice, a very soft eye, and a very strong  memory,' said this gentleman; 'the voice and eye I've got evidence for,  and the memory's an opinion of my own.
  And I'm never wrong.
  Let me  hear a song this minute.
'    'I don't think I know one, sir,' returned Nell.
    'You know forty-seven songs,' said the man, with a gravity which  admitted of no altercation on the subject.
  'Forty-seven's your number.
  Let me hear one of 'em--the best.
  Give me a song this minute.
'    Not knowing what might be the consequences of irritating her friend,  and trembling with the fear of doing so, poor Nell sang him some little  ditty which she had learned in happier times, and which was so  agreeable to his ear, that on its conclusion he in the same peremptory  manner requested to be favoured with another, to which he was so  obliging as to roar a chorus to no particular tune, and with no words  at all, but which amply made up in its amazing energy for its  deficiency in other respects.
  The noise of this vocal performance  awakened the other man, who, staggering upon deck and shaking his late  opponent by the hand, swore that singing was his pride and joy and  chief delight, and that he desired no better entertainment.
  With a  third call, more imperative than either of the two former, Nell felt  obliged to comply, and this time a chorus was maintained not only by  the two men together, but also by the third man on horseback, who being  by his position debarred from a nearer participation in the revels of  the night, roared when his companions roared, and rent the very air.
  In this way, with little cessation, and singing the same songs again  and again, the tired and exhausted child kept them in good humour all  that night; and many a cottager, who was roused from his soundest sleep  by the discordant chorus as it floated away upon the wind, hid his head  beneath the bed-clothes and trembled at the sounds.
    At length the morning dawned.
  It was no sooner light than it began to  rain heavily.
  As the child could not endure the intolerable vapours of  the cabin, they covered her, in return for her exertions, with some  pieces of sail-cloth and ends of tarpaulin, which sufficed to keep her  tolerably dry and to shelter her grandfather besides.
  As the day  advanced the rain increased.
  At noon it poured down more hopelessly  and heavily than ever without the faintest promise of abatement.
    They had, for some time, been gradually approaching the place for which  they were bound.
  The water had become thicker and dirtier; other  barges, coming from it, passed them frequently; the paths of coal-ash  and huts of staring brick, marked the vicinity of some great  manufacturing town; while scattered streets and houses, and smoke from  distant furnaces, indicated that they were already in the outskirts.
  Now, the clustered roofs, and piles of buildings, trembling with the  working of engines, and dimly resounding with their shrieks and  throbbings; the tall chimneys vomiting forth a black vapour, which hung  in a dense ill-favoured cloud above the housetops and filled the air  with gloom; the clank of hammers beating upon iron, the roar of busy  streets and noisy crowds, gradually augmenting until all the various  sounds blended into one and none was distinguishable for itself,  announced the termination of their journey.
    The boat floated into the wharf to which it belonged.
  The men were  occupied directly.
  The child and her grandfather, after waiting in  vain to thank them or ask them whither they should go, passed through a  dirty lane into a crowded street, and stood, amid its din and tumult,  and in the pouring rain, as strange, bewildered, and confused, as if  they had lived a thousand years before, and were raised from the dead  and placed there by a miracle.
              The throng of people hurried by, in two opposite streams, with no  symptom of cessation or exhaustion; intent upon their own affairs; and  undisturbed in their business speculations, by the roar of carts and  waggons laden with clashing wares, the slipping of horses' feet upon  the wet and greasy pavement, the rattling of the rain on windows and  umbrella-tops, the jostling of the more impatient passengers, and all  the noise and tumult of a crowded street in the high tide of its  occupation: while the two poor strangers, stunned and bewildered by the  hurry they beheld but had no part in, looked mournfully on; feeling,  amidst the crowd, a solitude which has no parallel but in the thirst of  the shipwrecked mariner, who, tost to and fro upon the billows of a  mighty ocean, his red eyes blinded by looking on the water which hems  him in on every side, has not one drop to cool his burning tongue.
    They withdrew into a low archway for shelter from the rain, and watched  the faces of those who passed, to find in one among them a ray of  encouragement or hope.
  Some frowned, some smiled, some muttered to  themselves, some made slight gestures, as if anticipating the  conversation in which they would shortly be engaged, some wore the  cunning look of bargaining and plotting, some were anxious and eager,  some slow and dull; in some countenances, were written gain; in others,  loss.
  It was like being in the confidence of all these people to stand  quietly there, looking into their faces as they flitted past.
  In busy  places, where each man has an object of his own, and feels assured that  every other man has his, his character and purpose are written broadly  in his face.
  In the public walks and lounges of a town, people go to  see and to be seen, and there the same expression, with little variety,  is repeated a hundred times.
  The working-day faces come nearer to the  truth, and let it out more plainly.
    Falling into that kind of abstraction which such a solitude awakens,  the child continued to gaze upon the passing crowd with a wondering  interest, amounting almost to a temporary forgetfulness of her own  condition.
  But cold, wet, hunger, want of rest, and lack of any place  in which to lay her aching head, soon brought her thoughts back to the  point whence they had strayed.
  No one passed who seemed to notice  them, or to whom she durst appeal.
  After some time, they left their  place of refuge from the weather, and mingled with the concourse.
    Evening came on.
  They were still wandering up and down, with fewer  people about them, but with the same sense of solitude in their own  breasts, and the same indifference from all around.
  The lights in the  streets and shops made them feel yet more desolate, for with their  help, night and darkness seemed to come on faster.
  Shivering with the  cold and damp, ill in body, and sick to death at heart, the child  needed her utmost firmness and resolution even to creep along.
    Why had they ever come to this noisy town, when there were peaceful  country places, in which, at least, they might have hungered and  thirsted, with less suffering than in its squalid strife!  They were  but an atom, here, in a mountain heap of misery, the very sight of  which increased their hopelessness and suffering.
    The child had not only to endure the accumulated hardships of their  destitute condition, but to bear the reproaches of her grandfather, who  began to murmur at having been led away from their late abode, and  demand that they should return to it.
  Being now penniless, and no  relief or prospect of relief appearing, they retraced their steps  through the deserted streets, and went back to the wharf, hoping to  find the boat in which they had come, and to be allowed to sleep on  board that night.
  But here again they were disappointed, for the gate  was closed, and some fierce dogs, barking at their approach, obliged  them to retreat.
    'We must sleep in the open air to-night, dear,' said the child in a  weak voice, as they turned away from this last repulse; 'and to-morrow  we will beg our way to some quiet part of the country, and try to earn  our bread in very humble work.
'    'Why did you bring me here?' returned the old man fiercely.
  'I cannot  bear these close eternal streets.
  We came from a quiet part.
  Why did  you force me to leave it?'    'Because I must have that dream I told you of, no more,' said the  child, with a momentary firmness that lost itself in tears; 'and we  must live among poor people, or it will come again.
  Dear grandfather,  you are old and weak, I know; but look at me.
  I never will complain if  you will not, but I have some suffering indeed.
'    'Ah! poor, houseless, wandering, motherless child!' cried the old man,  clasping his hands and gazing as if for the first time upon her anxious  face, her travel-stained dress, and bruised and swollen feet; 'has all  my agony of care brought her to this at last!  Was I a happy man once,  and have I lost happiness and all I had, for this!'    'If we were in the country now,' said the child, with assumed  cheerfulness, as they walked on looking about them for a shelter, we  should find some good old tree, stretching out his green arms as if he  loved us, and nodding and rustling as if he would have us fall asleep,  thinking of him while he watched.
  Please God, we shall be there  soon--to-morrow or next day at the farthest--and in the meantime let us  think, dear, that it was a good thing we came here; for we are lost in  the crowd and hurry of this place, and if any cruel people should  pursue us, they could surely never trace us further.
  There's comfort  in that.
  And here's a deep old doorway--very dark, but quite dry, and  warm too, for the wind don't blow in here--What's that!'    Uttering a half shriek, she recoiled from a black figure which came  suddenly out of the dark recess in which they were about to take  refuge, and stood still, looking at them.
    'Speak again,' it said; 'do I know the voice?'    'No,' replied the child timidly; 'we are strangers, and having no money  for a night's lodging, were going to rest here.
'    There was a feeble lamp at no great distance; the only one in the  place, which was a kind of square yard, but sufficient to show how poor  and mean it was.
  To this, the figure beckoned them; at the same time  drawing within its rays, as if to show that it had no desire to conceal  itself or take them at an advantage.
  The form was that of a man,  miserably clad and begrimed with smoke, which, perhaps by its contrast  with the natural colour of his skin, made him look paler than he really  was.
  That he was naturally of a very wan and pallid aspect, however,  his hollow cheeks, sharp features, and sunken eyes, no less than a  certain look of patient endurance, sufficiently testified.
  His voice  was harsh by nature, but not brutal; and though his face, besides  possessing the characteristics already mentioned, was overshadowed by a  quantity of long dark hair, its expression was neither ferocious nor  bad.
    'How came you to think of resting there?' he said.
  'Or how,' he added,  looking more attentively at the child, 'do you come to want a place of  rest at this time of night?'    'Our misfortunes,' the grandfather answered, 'are the cause.
'    'Do you know,' said the man, looking still more earnestly at Nell, 'how  wet she is, and that the damp streets are not a place for her?'    'I know it well, God help me,' he replied.
  'What can I do!'    The man looked at Nell again, and gently touched her garments, from  which the rain was running off in little streams.
  'I can give you  warmth,' he said, after a pause; 'nothing else.
  Such lodging as I  have, is in that house,' pointing to the doorway from which he had  emerged, 'but she is safer and better there than here.
  The fire is in  a rough place, but you can pass the night beside it safely, if you'll  trust yourselves to me.
  You see that red light yonder?'    They raised their eyes, and saw a lurid glare hanging in the dark sky;  the dull reflection of some distant fire.
    'It's not far,' said the man.
  'Shall I take you there?  You were going  to sleep upon cold bricks; I can give you a bed of warm ashes--nothing  better.
'    Without waiting for any further reply than he saw in their looks, he  took Nell in his arms, and bade the old man follow.
    Carrying her as tenderly, and as easily too, as if she had been an  infant, and showing himself both swift and sure of foot, he led the way  through what appeared to be the poorest and most wretched quarter of  the town; and turning aside to avoid the overflowing kennels or running  waterspouts, but holding his course, regardless of such obstructions,  and making his way straight through them.
  They had proceeded thus, in  silence, for some quarter of an hour, and had lost sight of the glare  to which he had pointed, in the dark and narrow ways by which they had  come, when it suddenly burst upon them again, streaming up from the  high chimney of a building close before them.
    'This is the place,' he said, pausing at a door to put Nell down and  take her hand.
  'Don't be afraid.
  There's nobody here will harm you.
'    It needed a strong confidence in this assurance to induce them to  enter, and what they saw inside did not diminish their apprehension and  alarm.
  In a large and lofty building, supported by pillars of iron,  with great black apertures in the upper walls, open to the external  air; echoing to the roof with the beating of hammers and roar of  furnaces, mingled with the hissing of red-hot metal plunged in water,  and a hundred strange unearthly noises never heard elsewhere; in this  gloomy place, moving like demons among the flame and smoke, dimly and  fitfully seen, flushed and tormented by the burning fires, and wielding  great weapons, a faulty blow from any one of which must have crushed  some workman's skull, a number of men laboured like giants.
  Others,  reposing upon heaps of coals or ashes, with their faces turned to the  black vault above, slept or rested from their toil.
  Others again,  opening the white-hot furnace-doors, cast fuel on the flames, which  came rushing and roaring forth to meet it, and licked it up like oil.
  Others drew forth, with clashing noise, upon the ground, great sheets  of glowing steel, emitting an insupportable heat, and a dull deep light  like that which reddens in the eyes of savage beasts.
    Through these bewildering sights and deafening sounds, their conductor  led them to where, in a dark portion of the building, one furnace burnt  by night and day--so, at least, they gathered from the motion of his  lips, for as yet they could only see him speak: not hear him.
  The man  who had been watching this fire, and whose task was ended for the  present, gladly withdrew, and left them with their friend, who,  spreading Nell's little cloak upon a heap of ashes, and showing her  where she could hang her outer-clothes to dry, signed to her and the  old man to lie down and sleep.
  For himself, he took his station on a  rugged mat before the furnace-door, and resting his chin upon his  hands, watched the flame as it shone through the iron chinks, and the  white ashes as they fell into their bright hot grave below.
    The warmth of her bed, hard and humble as it was, combined with the  great fatigue she had undergone, soon caused the tumult of the place to  fall with a gentler sound upon the child's tired ears, and was not long  in lulling her to sleep.
  The old man was stretched beside her, and  with her hand upon his neck she lay and dreamed.
    It was yet night when she awoke, nor did she know how long, or for how  short a time, she had slept.
  But she found herself protected, both  from any cold air that might find its way into the building, and from  the scorching heat, by some of the workmen's clothes; and glancing at  their friend saw that he sat in exactly the same attitude, looking with  a fixed earnestness of attention towards the fire, and keeping so very  still that he did not even seem to breathe.
  She lay in the state  between sleeping and waking, looking so long at his motionless figure  that at length she almost feared he had died as he sat there; and  softly rising and drawing close to him, ventured to whisper in his ear.
    He moved, and glancing from her to the place she had lately occupied,  as if to assure himself that it was really the child so near him,  looked inquiringly into her face.
    'I feared you were ill,' she said.
  'The other men are all in motion,  and you are so very quiet.
'    'They leave me to myself,' he replied.
  'They know my humour.
  They  laugh at me, but don't harm me in it.
  See yonder there--that's my  friend.
'    'The fire?' said the child.
    'It has been alive as long as I have,' the man made answer.
  'We talk  and think together all night long.
'    The child glanced quickly at him in her surprise, but he had turned his  eyes in their former direction, and was musing as before.
    'It's like a book to me,' he said--'the only book I ever learned to  read; and many an old story it tells me.
  It's music, for I should know  its voice among a thousand, and there are other voices in its roar.
  It  has its pictures too.
  You don't know how many strange faces and  different scenes I trace in the red-hot coals.
  It's my memory, that  fire, and shows me all my life.
'    The child, bending down to listen to his words, could not help  remarking with what brightened eyes he continued to speak and muse.
    'Yes,' he said, with a faint smile, 'it was the same when I was quite a  baby, and crawled about it, till I fell asleep.
  My father watched it  then.
'    'Had you no mother?' asked the child.
    'No, she was dead.
  Women work hard in these parts.
  She worked herself  to death they told me, and, as they said so then, the fire has gone on  saying the same thing ever since.
  I suppose it was true.
  I have  always believed it.
'    'Were you brought up here, then?' said the child.
    'Summer and winter,' he replied.
  'Secretly at first, but when they  found it out, they let him keep me here.
  So the fire nursed me--the  same fire.
  It has never gone out.
'    'You are fond of it?' said the child.
    'Of course I am.
  He died before it.
  I saw him fall down--just there,  where those ashes are burning now--and wondered, I remember, why it  didn't help him.
'    'Have you been here ever since?' asked the child.
    'Ever since I came to watch it; but there was a while between, and a  very cold dreary while it was.
  It burned all the time though, and  roared and leaped when I came back, as it used to do in our play days.
  You may guess, from looking at me, what kind of child I was, but for  all the difference between us I was a child, and when I saw you in the  street to-night, you put me in mind of myself, as I was after he died,  and made me wish to bring you to the fire.
  I thought of those old  times again, when I saw you sleeping by it.
  You should be sleeping  now.
  Lie down again, poor child, lie down again!'    With that, he led her to her rude couch, and covering her with the  clothes with which she had found herself enveloped when she woke,  returned to his seat, whence he moved no more unless to feed the  furnace, but remained motionless as a statue.
  The child continued to  watch him for a little time, but soon yielded to the drowsiness that  came upon her, and, in the dark strange place and on the heap of ashes,  slept as peacefully as if the room had been a palace chamber, and the  bed, a bed of down.
    When she awoke again, broad day was shining through the lofty openings  in the walls, and, stealing in slanting rays but midway down, seemed to  make the building darker than it had been at night.
  The clang and  tumult were still going on, and the remorseless fires were burning  fiercely as before; for few changes of night and day brought rest or  quiet there.
    Her friend parted his breakfast--a scanty mess of coffee and some  coarse bread--with the child and her grandfather, and inquired whither  they were going.
  She told him that they sought some distant country  place remote from towns or even other villages, and with a faltering  tongue inquired what road they would do best to take.
    'I know little of the country,' he said, shaking his head, 'for such as  I, pass all our lives before our furnace doors, and seldom go forth to  breathe.
  But there are such places yonder.
'    'And far from here?' said Nell.
    'Aye surely.
  How could they be near us, and be green and fresh?  The  road lies, too, through miles and miles, all lighted up by fires like  ours--a strange black road, and one that would frighten you by night.
'    'We are here and must go on,' said the child boldly; for she saw that  the old man listened with anxious ears to this account.
    'Rough people--paths never made for little feet like yours--a dismal  blighted way--is there no turning back, my child?'    'There is none,' cried Nell, pressing forward.
  'If you can direct us,  do.
  If not, pray do not seek to turn us from our purpose.
  Indeed you  do not know the danger that we shun, and how right and true we are in  flying from it, or you would not try to stop us, I am sure you would  not.
'    'God forbid, if it is so!' said their uncouth protector, glancing from  the eager child to her grandfather, who hung his head and bent his eyes  upon the ground.
  'I'll direct you from the door, the best I can.
  I  wish I could do more.
'    He showed them, then, by which road they must leave the town, and what  course they should hold when they had gained it.
  He lingered so long  on these instructions, that the child, with a fervent blessing, tore  herself away, and stayed to hear no more.
    But, before they had reached the corner of the lane, the man came  running after them, and, pressing her hand, left something in it--two  old, battered, smoke-encrusted penny pieces.
  Who knows but they shone  as brightly in the eyes of angels, as golden gifts that have been  chronicled on tombs?    And thus they separated; the child to lead her sacred charge farther  from guilt and shame; the labourer to attach a fresh interest to the  spot where his guests had slept, and read new histories in his furnace  fire.
              In all their journeying, they had never longed so ardently, they had  never so pined and wearied, for the freedom of pure air and open  country, as now.
  No, not even on that memorable morning, when,  deserting their old home, they abandoned themselves to the mercies of a  strange world, and left all the dumb and senseless things they had  known and loved, behind--not even then, had they so yearned for the  fresh solitudes of wood, hillside, and field, as now, when the noise  and dirt and vapour, of the great manufacturing town reeking with lean  misery and hungry wretchedness, hemmed them in on every side, and  seemed to shut out hope, and render escape impossible.
    'Two days and nights!' thought the child.
  'He said two days and nights  we should have to spend among such scenes as these.
  Oh! if we live to  reach the country once again, if we get clear of these dreadful places,  though it is only to lie down and die, with what a grateful heart I  shall thank God for so much mercy!'    With thoughts like this, and with some vague design of travelling to a  great distance among streams and mountains, where only very poor and  simple people lived, and where they might maintain themselves by very  humble helping work in farms, free from such terrors as that from which  they fled--the child, with no resource but the poor man's gift, and no  encouragement but that which flowed from her own heart, and its sense  of the truth and right of what she did, nerved herself to this last  journey and boldly pursued her task.
    'We shall be very slow to-day, dear,' she said, as they toiled  painfully through the streets; 'my feet are sore, and I have pains in  all my limbs from the wet of yesterday.
  I saw that he looked at us and  thought of that, when he said how long we should be upon the road.
'    'It was a dreary way he told us of,' returned her grandfather,  piteously.
  'Is there no other road?  Will you not let me go some other  way than this?'    'Places lie beyond these,' said the child, firmly, 'where we may live  in peace, and be tempted to do no harm.
  We will take the road that  promises to have that end, and we would not turn out of it, if it were  a hundred times worse than our fears lead us to expect.
  We would not,  dear, would we?'    'No,' replied the old man, wavering in his voice, no less than in his  manner.
  'No.
  Let us go on.
  I am ready.
  I am quite ready, Nell.
'    The child walked with more difficulty than she had led her companion to  expect, for the pains that racked her joints were of no common  severity, and every exertion increased them.
  But they wrung from her  no complaint, or look of suffering; and, though the two travellers  proceeded very slowly, they did proceed.
  Clearing the town in course  of time, they began to feel that they were fairly on their way.
    A long suburb of red brick houses--some with patches of garden-ground,  where coal-dust and factory smoke darkened the shrinking leaves, and  coarse rank flowers, and where the struggling vegetation sickened and  sank under the hot breath of kiln and furnace, making them by its  presence seem yet more blighting and unwholesome than in the town  itself--a long, flat, straggling suburb passed, they came, by slow  degrees, upon a cheerless region, where not a blade of grass was seen  to grow, where not a bud put forth its promise in the spring, where  nothing green could live but on the surface of the stagnant pools,  which here and there lay idly sweltering by the black road-side.
    Advancing more and more into the shadow of this mournful place, its  dark depressing influence stole upon their spirits, and filled them  with a dismal gloom.
  On every side, and far as the eye could see into  the heavy distance, tall chimneys, crowding on each other, and  presenting that endless repetition of the same dull, ugly form, which  is the horror of oppressive dreams, poured out their plague of smoke,  obscured the light, and made foul the melancholy air.
  On mounds of  ashes by the wayside, sheltered only by a few rough boards, or rotten  pent-house roofs, strange engines spun and writhed like tortured  creatures; clanking their iron chains, shrieking in their rapid whirl  from time to time as though in torment unendurable, and making the  ground tremble with their agonies.
  Dismantled houses here and there  appeared, tottering to the earth, propped up by fragments of others  that had fallen down, unroofed, windowless, blackened, desolate, but  yet inhabited.
  Men, women, children, wan in their looks and ragged in  attire, tended the engines, fed their tributary fire, begged upon the  road, or scowled half-naked from the doorless houses.
  Then came more  of the wrathful monsters, whose like they almost seemed to be in their  wildness and their untamed air, screeching and turning round and round  again; and still, before, behind, and to the right and left, was the  same interminable perspective of brick towers, never ceasing in their  black vomit, blasting all things living or inanimate, shutting out the  face of day, and closing in on all these horrors with a dense dark  cloud.
    But night-time in this dreadful spot!--night, when the smoke was  changed to fire; when every chimney spirited up its flame; and places,  that had been dark vaults all day, now shone red-hot, with figures  moving to and fro within their blazing jaws, and calling to one another  with hoarse cries--night, when the noise of every strange machine was  aggravated by the darkness; when the people near them looked wilder and  more savage; when bands of unemployed labourers paraded the roads, or  clustered by torch-light round their leaders, who told them, in stern  language, of their wrongs, and urged them on to frightful cries and  threats; when maddened men, armed with sword and firebrand, spurning  the tears and prayers of women who would restrain them, rushed forth on  errands of terror and destruction, to work no ruin half so surely as  their own--night, when carts came rumbling by, filled with rude  coffins (for contagious disease and death had been busy with the living  crops); when orphans cried, and distracted women shrieked and followed  in their wake--night, when some called for bread, and some for drink to  drown their cares, and some with tears, and some with staggering feet,  and some with bloodshot eyes, went brooding home--night, which, unlike  the night that Heaven sends on earth, brought with it no peace, nor  quiet, nor signs of blessed sleep--who shall tell the terrors of the  night to the young wandering child!    And yet she lay down, with nothing between her and the sky; and, with  no fear for herself, for she was past it now, put up a prayer for the  poor old man.
  So very weak and spent, she felt, so very calm and  unresisting, that she had no thought of any wants of her own, but  prayed that God would raise up some friend for him.
  She tried to  recall the way they had come, and to look in the direction where the  fire by which they had slept last night was burning.
  She had forgotten  to ask the name of the poor man, their friend, and when she had  remembered him in her prayers, it seemed ungrateful not to turn one  look towards the spot where he was watching.
    A penny loaf was all they had had that day.
  It was very little, but  even hunger was forgotten in the strange tranquillity that crept over  her senses.
  She lay down, very gently, and, with a quiet smile upon  her face, fell into a slumber.
  It was not like sleep--and yet it must  have been, or why those pleasant dreams of the little scholar all night  long!  Morning came.
  Much weaker, diminished powers even of sight and  hearing, and yet the child made no complaint--perhaps would have made  none, even if she had not had that inducement to be silent, travelling  by her side.
  She felt a hopelessness of their ever being extricated  together from that forlorn place; a dull conviction that she was very  ill, perhaps dying; but no fear or anxiety.
    A loathing of food that she was not conscious of until they expended  their last penny in the purchase of another loaf, prevented her  partaking even of this poor repast.
  Her grandfather ate greedily,  which she was glad to see.
    Their way lay through the same scenes as yesterday, with no variety or  improvement.
  There was the same thick air, difficult to breathe; the  same blighted ground, the same hopeless prospect, the same misery and  distress.
  Objects appeared more dim, the noise less, the path more  rugged and uneven, for sometimes she stumbled, and became roused, as it  were, in the effort to prevent herself from falling.
  Poor child! the  cause was in her tottering feet.
    Towards the afternoon, her grandfather complained bitterly of hunger.
  She approached one of the wretched hovels by the way-side, and knocked  with her hand upon the door.
    'What would you have here?' said a gaunt man, opening it.
    'Charity.
  A morsel of bread.
'    'Do you see that?' returned the man hoarsely, pointing to a kind of  bundle on the ground.
  'That's a dead child.
  I and five hundred other  men were thrown out of work, three months ago.
  That is my third dead  child, and last.
  Do you think I have charity to bestow, or a morsel of  bread to spare?'    The child recoiled from the door, and it closed upon her.
  Impelled by  strong necessity, she knocked at another: a neighbouring one, which,  yielding to the slight pressure of her hand, flew open.
    It seemed that a couple of poor families lived in this hovel, for two  women, each among children of her own, occupied different portions of  the room.
  In the centre, stood a grave gentleman in black who appeared  to have just entered, and who held by the arm a boy.
    'Here, woman,' he said, 'here's your deaf and dumb son.
  You may thank  me for restoring him to you.
  He was brought before me, this morning,  charged with theft; and with any other boy it would have gone hard, I  assure you.
  But, as I had compassion on his infirmities, and thought  he might have learnt no better, I have managed to bring him back to  you.
  Take more care of him for the future.
'    'And won't you give me back MY son!' said the other woman, hastily  rising and confronting him.
  'Won't you give me back MY son, Sir, who  was transported for the same offence!'    'Was he deaf and dumb, woman?' asked the gentleman sternly.
    'Was he not, Sir?'    'You know he was not.
'    'He was,' cried the woman.
  'He was deaf, dumb, and blind, to all that  was good and right, from his cradle.
  Her boy may have learnt no  better! where did mine learn better?  where could he?  who was there to  teach him better, or where was it to be learnt?'    'Peace, woman,' said the gentleman, 'your boy was in possession of all  his senses.
'    'He was,' cried the mother; 'and he was the more easy to be led astray  because he had them.
  If you save this boy because he may not know  right from wrong, why did you not save mine who was never taught the  difference?  You gentlemen have as good a right to punish her boy, that  God has kept in ignorance of sound and speech, as you have to punish  mine, that you kept in ignorance yourselves.
  How many of the girls and  boys--ah, men and women too--that are brought before you and you don't  pity, are deaf and dumb in their minds, and go wrong in that state, and  are punished in that state, body and soul, while you gentlemen are  quarrelling among yourselves whether they ought to learn this or  that?--Be a just man, Sir, and give me back my son.
'    'You are desperate,' said the gentleman, taking out his snuff-box, 'and  I am sorry for you.
'    'I AM desperate,' returned the woman, 'and you have made me so.
  Give  me back my son, to work for these helpless children.
  Be a just man,  Sir, and, as you have had mercy upon this boy, give me back my son!'    The child had seen and heard enough to know that this was not a place  at which to ask for alms.
  She led the old man softly from the door,  and they pursued their journey.
    With less and less of hope or strength, as they went on, but with an  undiminished resolution not to betray by any word or sigh her sinking  state, so long as she had energy to move, the child, throughout the  remainder of that hard day, compelled herself to proceed: not even  stopping to rest as frequently as usual, to compensate in some measure  for the tardy pace at which she was obliged to walk.
  Evening was  drawing on, but had not closed in, when--still travelling among the  same dismal objects--they came to a busy town.
    Faint and spiritless as they were, its streets were insupportable.
  After humbly asking for relief at some few doors, and being repulsed,  they agreed to make their way out of it as speedily as they could, and  try if the inmates of any lone house beyond, would have more pity on  their exhausted state.
    They were dragging themselves along through the last street, and the  child felt that the time was close at hand when her enfeebled powers  would bear no more.
  There appeared before them, at this juncture,  going in the same direction as themselves, a traveller on foot, who,  with a portmanteau strapped to his back, leaned upon a stout stick as  he walked, and read from a book which he held in his other hand.
    It was not an easy matter to come up with him, and beseech his aid, for  he walked fast, and was a little distance in advance.
  At length, he  stopped, to look more attentively at some passage in his book.
  Animated with a ray of hope, the child shot on before her grandfather,  and, going close to the stranger without rousing him by the sound of  her footsteps, began, in a few faint words, to implore his help.
    He turned his head.
  The child clapped her hands together, uttered a  wild shriek, and fell senseless at his feet.
              It was the poor schoolmaster.
  No other than the poor schoolmaster.
  Scarcely less moved and surprised by the sight of the child than she  had been on recognising him, he stood, for a moment, silent and  confounded by this unexpected apparition, without even the presence of  mind to raise her from the ground.
    But, quickly recovering his self-possession, he threw down his stick  and book, and dropping on one knee beside her, endeavoured, by such  simple means as occurred to him, to restore her to herself; while her  grandfather, standing idly by, wrung his hands, and implored her with  many endearing expressions to speak to him, were it only a word.
    'She is quite exhausted,' said the schoolmaster, glancing upward into  his face.
  'You have taxed her powers too far, friend.
'    'She is perishing of want,' rejoined the old man.
  'I never thought how  weak and ill she was, till now.
'    Casting a look upon him, half-reproachful and half-compassionate, the  schoolmaster took the child in his arms, and, bidding the old man  gather up her little basket and follow him directly, bore her away at  his utmost speed.
    There was a small inn within sight, to which, it would seem, he had  been directing his steps when so unexpectedly overtaken.
  Towards this  place he hurried with his unconscious burden, and rushing into the  kitchen, and calling upon the company there assembled to make way for  God's sake, deposited it on a chair before the fire.
    The company, who rose in confusion on the schoolmaster's entrance, did  as people usually do under such circumstances.
  Everybody called for  his or her favourite remedy, which nobody brought; each cried for more  air, at the same time carefully excluding what air there was, by  closing round the object of sympathy; and all wondered why somebody  else didn't do what it never appeared to occur to them might be done by  themselves.
    The landlady, however, who possessed more readiness and activity than  any of them, and who had withal a quicker perception of the merits of  the case, soon came running in, with a little hot brandy and water,  followed by her servant-girl, carrying vinegar, hartshorn,  smelling-salts, and such other restoratives; which, being duly  administered, recovered the child so far as to enable her to thank them  in a faint voice, and to extend her hand to the poor schoolmaster, who  stood, with an anxious face, hard by.
  Without suffering her to speak  another word, or so much as to stir a finger any more, the women  straightway carried her off to bed; and, having covered her up warm,  bathed her cold feet, and wrapped them in flannel, they despatched a  messenger for the doctor.
    The doctor, who was a red-nosed gentleman with a great bunch of seals  dangling below a waistcoat of ribbed black satin, arrived with all  speed, and taking his seat by the bedside of poor Nell, drew out his  watch, and felt her pulse.
  Then he looked at her tongue, then he felt  her pulse again, and while he did so, he eyed the half-emptied  wine-glass as if in profound abstraction.
    'I should give her,' said the doctor at length, 'a tea-spoonful, every  now and then, of hot brandy and water.
'    'Why, that's exactly what we've done, sir!' said the delighted landlady.
    'I should also,' observed the doctor, who had passed the foot-bath on  the stairs, 'I should also,' said the doctor, in the voice of an  oracle, 'put her feet in hot water, and wrap them up in flannel.
  I  should likewise,' said the doctor with increased solemnity, 'give her  something light for supper--the wing of a roasted fowl now--'    'Why, goodness gracious me, sir, it's cooking at the kitchen fire this  instant!' cried the landlady.
  And so indeed it was, for the  schoolmaster had ordered it to be put down, and it was getting on so  well that the doctor might have smelt it if he had tried; perhaps he  did.
    'You may then,' said the doctor, rising gravely, 'give her a glass of  hot mulled port wine, if she likes wine--'    'And a toast, Sir?' suggested the landlady.
    'Ay,' said the doctor, in the tone of a man who makes a dignified  concession.
  'And a toast--of bread.
  But be very particular to make it  of bread, if you please, ma'am.
'    With which parting injunction, slowly and portentously delivered, the  doctor departed, leaving the whole house in admiration of that wisdom  which tallied so closely with their own.
  Everybody said he was a very  shrewd doctor indeed, and knew perfectly what people's constitutions  were; which there appears some reason to suppose he did.
    While her supper was preparing, the child fell into a refreshing sleep,  from which they were obliged to rouse her when it was ready.
  As she  evinced extraordinary uneasiness on learning that her grandfather was  below stairs, and as she was greatly troubled at the thought of their  being apart, he took his supper with her.
  Finding her still very  restless on this head, they made him up a bed in an inner room, to  which he presently retired.
  The key of this chamber happened by good  fortune to be on that side of the door which was in Nell's room; she  turned it on him when the landlady had withdrawn, and crept to bed  again with a thankful heart.
    The schoolmaster sat for a long time smoking his pipe by the kitchen  fire, which was now deserted, thinking, with a very happy face, on the  fortunate chance which had brought him so opportunely to the child's  assistance, and parrying, as well as in his simple way he could, the  inquisitive cross-examination of the landlady, who had a great  curiosity to be made acquainted with every particular of Nell's life  and history.
  The poor schoolmaster was so open-hearted, and so little  versed in the most ordinary cunning or deceit, that she could not have  failed to succeed in the first five minutes, but that he happened to be  unacquainted with what she wished to know; and so he told her.
  The  landlady, by no means satisfied with this assurance, which she  considered an ingenious evasion of the question, rejoined that he had  his reasons of course.
  Heaven forbid that she should wish to pry into  the affairs of her customers, which indeed were no business of hers,  who had so many of her own.
  She had merely asked a civil question, and  to be sure she knew it would meet with a civil answer.
  She was quite  satisfied--quite.
  She had rather perhaps that he would have said at  once that he didn't choose to be communicative, because that would have  been plain and intelligible.
  However, she had no right to be offended  of course.
  He was the best judge, and had a perfect right to say what  he pleased; nobody could dispute that for a moment.
  Oh dear, no!    'I assure you, my good lady,' said the mild schoolmaster, 'that I have  told you the plain truth.
  As I hope to be saved, I have told you the  truth.
'    'Why then, I do believe you are in earnest,' rejoined the landlady,  with ready good-humour, 'and I'm very sorry I have teazed you.
  But  curiosity you know is the curse of our sex, and that's the fact.
'    The landlord scratched his head, as if he thought the curse sometimes  involved the other sex likewise; but he was prevented from making any  remark to that effect, if he had it in contemplation to do so, by the  schoolmaster's rejoinder.
    'You should question me for half-a-dozen hours at a sitting, and  welcome, and I would answer you patiently for the kindness of heart you  have shown to-night, if I could,' he said.
  'As it is, please to take  care of her in the morning, and let me know early how she is; and to  understand that I am paymaster for the three.
'    So, parting with them on most friendly terms (not the less cordial  perhaps for this last direction), the schoolmaster went to his bed, and  the host and hostess to theirs.
    The report in the morning was, that the child was better, but was  extremely weak, and would at least require a day's rest, and careful  nursing, before she could proceed upon her journey.
  The schoolmaster  received this communication with perfect cheerfulness, observing that  he had a day to spare--two days for that matter--and could very well  afford to wait.
  As the patient was to sit up in the evening, he  appointed to visit her in her room at a certain hour, and rambling out  with his book, did not return until the hour arrived.
    Nell could not help weeping when they were left alone; whereat, and at  sight of her pale face and wasted figure, the simple schoolmaster shed  a few tears himself, at the same time showing in very energetic  language how foolish it was to do so, and how very easily it could be  avoided, if one tried.
    'It makes me unhappy even in the midst of all this kindness' said the  child, 'to think that we should be a burden upon you.
  How can I ever  thank you?  If I had not met you so far from home, I must have died,  and he would have been left alone.
'    'We'll not talk about dying,' said the schoolmaster; 'and as to  burdens, I have made my fortune since you slept at my cottage.
'    'Indeed!' cried the child joyfully.
    'Oh yes,' returned her friend.
  'I have been appointed clerk and  schoolmaster to a village a long way from here--and a long way from the  old one as you may suppose--at five-and-thirty pounds a year.
  Five-and-thirty pounds!'    'I am very glad,' said the child, 'so very, very glad.
'    'I am on my way there now,' resumed the schoolmaster.
  'They allowed me  the stage-coach-hire--outside stage-coach-hire all the way.
  Bless you,  they grudge me nothing.
  But as the time at which I am expected there,  left me ample leisure, I determined to walk instead.
  How glad I am, to  think I did so!'    'How glad should we be!'    'Yes, yes,' said the schoolmaster, moving restlessly in his chair,  'certainly, that's very true.
  But you--where are you going, where are  you coming from, what have you been doing since you left me, what had  you been doing before?  Now, tell me--do tell me.
  I know very little  of the world, and perhaps you are better fitted to advise me in its  affairs than I am qualified to give advice to you; but I am very  sincere, and I have a reason (you have not forgotten it) for loving  you.
  I have felt since that time as if my love for him who died, had  been transferred to you who stood beside his bed.
  If this,' he added,  looking upwards, 'is the beautiful creation that springs from ashes,  let its peace prosper with me, as I deal tenderly and compassionately  by this young child!'    The plain, frank kindness of the honest schoolmaster, the affectionate  earnestness of his speech and manner, the truth which was stamped upon  his every word and look, gave the child a confidence in him, which the  utmost arts of treachery and dissimulation could never have awakened in  her breast.
  She told him all--that they had no friend or  relative--that she had fled with the old man, to save him from a  madhouse and all the miseries he dreaded--that she was flying now, to  save him from himself--and that she sought an asylum in some remote  and primitive place, where the temptation before which he fell would  never enter, and her late sorrows and distresses could have no place.
    The schoolmaster heard her with astonishment.
  'This child!'--he  thought--'Has this child heroically persevered under all doubts and  dangers, struggled with poverty and suffering, upheld and sustained by  strong affection and the consciousness of rectitude alone!  And yet the  world is full of such heroism.
  Have I yet to learn that the hardest  and best-borne trials are those which are never chronicled in any  earthly record, and are suffered every day!  And should I be surprised  to hear the story of this child!'    What more he thought or said, matters not.
  It was concluded that Nell  and her grandfather should accompany him to the village whither he was  bound, and that he should endeavour to find them some humble occupation  by which they could subsist.
  'We shall be sure to succeed,' said the  schoolmaster, heartily.
  'The cause is too good a one to fail.
'    They arranged to proceed upon their journey next evening, as a  stage-waggon, which travelled for some distance on the same road as  they must take, would stop at the inn to change horses, and the driver  for a small gratuity would give Nell a place inside.
  A bargain was  soon struck when the waggon came; and in due time it rolled away; with  the child comfortably bestowed among the softer packages, her  grandfather and the schoolmaster walking on beside the driver, and the  landlady and all the good folks of the inn screaming out their good  wishes and farewells.
    What a soothing, luxurious, drowsy way of travelling, to lie inside  that slowly-moving mountain, listening to the tinkling of the horses'  bells, the occasional smacking of the carter's whip, the smooth rolling  of the great broad wheels, the rattle of the harness, the cheery  good-nights of passing travellers jogging past on little short-stepped  horses--all made pleasantly indistinct by the thick awning, which  seemed made for lazy listening under, till one fell asleep!  The very  going to sleep, still with an indistinct idea, as the head jogged to  and fro upon the pillow, of moving onward with no trouble or fatigue,  and hearing all these sounds like dreamy music, lulling to the  senses--and the slow waking up, and finding one's self staring out  through the breezy curtain half-opened in the front, far up into the  cold bright sky with its countless stars, and downward at the driver's  lantern dancing on like its namesake Jack of the swamps and marshes,  and sideways at the dark grim trees, and forward at the long bare road  rising up, up, up, until it stopped abruptly at a sharp high ridge as  if there were no more road, and all beyond was sky--and the stopping at  the inn to bait, and being helped out, and going into a room with fire  and candles, and winking very much, and being agreeably reminded that  the night was cold, and anxious for very comfort's sake to think it  colder than it was!--What a delicious journey was that journey in the  waggon.
    Then the going on again--so fresh at first, and shortly afterwards so  sleepy.
  The waking from a sound nap as the mail came dashing past like  a highway comet, with gleaming lamps and rattling hoofs, and visions of  a guard behind, standing up to keep his feet warm, and of a gentleman  in a fur cap opening his eyes and looking wild and stupefied--the  stopping at the turnpike where the man was gone to bed, and knocking at  the door until he answered with a smothered shout from under the  bed-clothes in the little room above, where the faint light was  burning, and presently came down, night-capped and shivering, to throw  the gate wide open, and wish all waggons off the road except by day.
  The cold sharp interval between night and morning--the distant streak  of light widening and spreading, and turning from grey to white, and  from white to yellow, and from yellow to burning red--the presence of  day, with all its cheerfulness and life--men and horses at the  plough--birds in the trees and hedges, and boys in solitary fields,  frightening them away with rattles.
  The coming to a town--people busy  in the markets; light carts and chaises round the tavern yard;  tradesmen standing at their doors; men running horses up and down the  street for sale; pigs plunging and grunting in the dirty distance,  getting off with long strings at their legs, running into clean  chemists' shops and being dislodged with brooms by 'prentices; the  night coach changing horses--the passengers cheerless, cold, ugly, and  discontented, with three months' growth of hair in one night--the  coachman fresh as from a band-box, and exquisitely beautiful by  contrast:--so much bustle, so many things in motion, such a variety of  incidents--when was there a journey with so many delights as that  journey in the waggon!    Sometimes walking for a mile or two while her grandfather rode inside,  and sometimes even prevailing upon the schoolmaster to take her place  and lie down to rest, Nell travelled on very happily until they came to  a large town, where the waggon stopped, and where they spent a night.
  They passed a large church; and in the streets were a number of old  houses, built of a kind of earth or plaster, crossed and re-crossed in  a great many directions with black beams, which gave them a remarkable  and very ancient look.
  The doors, too, were arched and low, some with  oaken portals and quaint benches, where the former inhabitants had sat  on summer evenings.
  The windows were latticed in little diamond panes,  that seemed to wink and blink upon the passengers as if they were dim  of sight.
  They had long since got clear of the smoke and furnaces,  except in one or two solitary instances, where a factory planted among  fields withered the space about it, like a burning mountain.
  When they  had passed through this town, they entered again upon the country, and  began to draw near their place of destination.
    It was not so near, however, but that they spent another night upon the  road; not that their doing so was quite an act of necessity, but that  the schoolmaster, when they approached within a few miles of his  village, had a fidgety sense of his dignity as the new clerk, and was  unwilling to make his entry in dusty shoes, and travel-disordered  dress.
  It was a fine, clear, autumn morning, when they came upon the  scene of his promotion, and stopped to contemplate its beauties.
    'See--here's the church!' cried the delighted schoolmaster in a low  voice; 'and that old building close beside it, is the schoolhouse, I'll  be sworn.
  Five-and-thirty pounds a-year in this beautiful place!'    They admired everything--the old grey porch, the mullioned windows, the  venerable gravestones dotting the green churchyard, the ancient tower,  the very weathercock; the brown thatched roofs of cottage, barn, and  homestead, peeping from among the trees; the stream that rippled by the  distant water-mill; the blue Welsh mountains far away.
  It was for such  a spot the child had wearied in the dense, dark, miserable haunts of  labour.
  Upon her bed of ashes, and amidst the squalid horrors through  which they had forced their way, visions of such scenes--beautiful  indeed, but not more beautiful than this sweet reality--had been always  present to her mind.
  They had seemed to melt into a dim and airy  distance, as the prospect of ever beholding them again grew fainter;  but, as they receded, she had loved and panted for them more.
    'I must leave you somewhere for a few minutes,' said the schoolmaster,  at length breaking the silence into which they had fallen in their  gladness.
  'I have a letter to present, and inquiries to make, you  know.
  Where shall I take you?  To the little inn yonder?'    'Let us wait here,' rejoined Nell.
  'The gate is open.
  We will sit in  the church porch till you come back.
'    'A good place too,' said the schoolmaster, leading the way towards it,  disencumbering himself of his portmanteau, and placing it on the stone  seat.
  'Be sure that I come back with good news, and am not long gone!'    So, the happy schoolmaster put on a bran-new pair of gloves which he  had carried in a little parcel in his pocket all the way, and hurried  off, full of ardour and excitement.
    The child watched him from the porch until the intervening foliage hid  him from her view, and then stepped softly out into the old  churchyard--so solemn and quiet that every rustle of her dress upon the  fallen leaves, which strewed the path and made her footsteps noiseless,  seemed an invasion of its silence.
  It was a very aged, ghostly place;  the church had been built many hundreds of years ago, and had once had  a convent or monastery attached; for arches in ruins, remains of oriel  windows, and fragments of blackened walls, were yet standing; while  other portions of the old building, which had crumbled away and fallen  down, were mingled with the churchyard earth and overgrown with grass,  as if they too claimed a burying-place and sought to mix their ashes  with the dust of men.
  Hard by these gravestones of dead years, and  forming a part of the ruin which some pains had been taken to render  habitable in modern times, were two small dwellings with sunken windows  and oaken doors, fast hastening to decay, empty and desolate.
    Upon these tenements, the attention of the child became exclusively  riveted.
  She knew not why.
  The church, the ruin, the antiquated  graves, had equal claims at least upon a stranger's thoughts, but from  the moment when her eyes first rested on these two dwellings, she could  turn to nothing else.
  Even when she had made the circuit of the  enclosure, and, returning to the porch, sat pensively waiting for their  friend, she took her station where she could still look upon them, and  felt as if fascinated towards that spot.
              Kit's mother and the single gentleman--upon whose track it is expedient  to follow with hurried steps, lest this history should be chargeable  with inconstancy, and the offence of leaving its characters in  situations of uncertainty and doubt--Kit's mother and the single  gentleman, speeding onward in the post-chaise-and-four whose departure  from the Notary's door we have already witnessed, soon left the town  behind them, and struck fire from the flints of the broad highway.
    The good woman, being not a little embarrassed by the novelty of her  situation, and certain material apprehensions that perhaps by this time  little Jacob, or the baby, or both, had fallen into the fire, or  tumbled down stairs, or had been squeezed behind doors, or had scalded  their windpipes in endeavouring to allay their thirst at the spouts of  tea-kettles, preserved an uneasy silence; and meeting from the window  the eyes of turnpike-men, omnibus-drivers, and others, felt in the new  dignity of her position like a mourner at a funeral, who, not being  greatly afflicted by the loss of the departed, recognizes his every-day  acquaintance from the window of the mourning coach, but is constrained  to preserve a decent solemnity, and the appearance of being indifferent  to all external objects.
    To have been indifferent to the companionship of the single gentleman  would have been tantamount to being gifted with nerves of steel.
  Never  did chaise inclose, or horses draw, such a restless gentleman as he.
  He never sat in the same position for two minutes together, but was  perpetually tossing his arms and legs about, pulling up the sashes and  letting them violently down, or thrusting his head out of one window to  draw it in again and thrust it out of another.
  He carried in his  pocket, too, a fire-box of mysterious and unknown construction; and as  sure as ever Kit's mother closed her eyes, so surely--whisk, rattle,  fizz--there was the single gentleman consulting his watch by a flame of  fire, and letting the sparks fall down among the straw as if there were  no such thing as a possibility of himself and Kit's mother being  roasted alive before the boys could stop their horses.
  Whenever they  halted to change, there he was--out of the carriage without letting  down the steps, bursting about the inn-yard like a lighted cracker,  pulling out his watch by lamp-light and forgetting to look at it before  he put it up again, and in short committing so many extravagances that  Kit's mother was quite afraid of him.
  Then, when the horses were to,  in he came like a Harlequin, and before they had gone a mile, out came  the watch and the fire-box together, and Kit's mother as wide awake  again, with no hope of a wink of sleep for that stage.
    'Are you comfortable?' the single gentleman would say after one of  these exploits, turning sharply round.
    'Quite, Sir, thank you.
'    'Are you sure?  An't you cold?'    'It is a little chilly, Sir,' Kit's mother would reply.
    'I knew it!' cried the single gentleman, letting down one of the front  glasses.
  'She wants some brandy and water!  Of course she does.
  How  could I forget it?  Hallo!  Stop at the next inn, and call out for a  glass of hot brandy and water.
'    It was in vain for Kit's mother to protest that she stood in need of  nothing of the kind.
  The single gentleman was inexorable; and whenever  he had exhausted all other modes and fashions of restlessness, it  invariably occurred to him that Kit's mother wanted brandy and water.
    In this way they travelled on until near midnight, when they stopped to  supper, for which meal the single gentleman ordered everything eatable  that the house contained; and because Kit's mother didn't eat  everything at once, and eat it all, he took it into his head that she  must be ill.
    'You're faint,' said the single gentleman, who did nothing himself but  walk about the room.
  'I see what's the matter with you, ma'am.
  You're  faint.
'    'Thank you, sir, I'm not indeed.
'    'I know you are.
  I'm sure of it.
  I drag this poor woman from the  bosom of her family at a minute's notice, and she goes on getting  fainter and fainter before my eyes.
  I'm a pretty fellow!  How many  children have you got, ma'am?'    'Two, sir, besides Kit.
'    'Boys, ma'am?'    'Yes, sir.
'    'Are they christened?'    'Only half baptised as yet, sir.
'    'I'm godfather to both of 'em.
  Remember that, if you please, ma'am.
  You had better have some mulled wine.
'    'I couldn't touch a drop indeed, sir.
'    'You must,' said the single gentleman.
  'I see you want it.
  I ought to  have thought of it before.
'    Immediately flying to the bell, and calling for mulled wine as  impetuously as if it had been wanted for instant use in the recovery of  some person apparently drowned, the single gentleman made Kit's mother  swallow a bumper of it at such a high temperature that the tears ran  down her face, and then hustled her off to the chaise again, where--not  impossibly from the effects of this agreeable sedative--she soon became  insensible to his restlessness, and fell fast asleep.
  Nor were the  happy effects of this prescription of a transitory nature, as,  notwithstanding that the distance was greater, and the journey longer,  than the single gentleman had anticipated, she did not awake until it  was broad day, and they were clattering over the pavement of a town.
    'This is the place!' cried her companion, letting down all the glasses.
  'Drive to the wax-work!'    The boy on the wheeler touched his hat, and setting spurs to his horse,  to the end that they might go in brilliantly, all four broke into a  smart canter, and dashed through the streets with a noise that brought  the good folks wondering to their doors and windows, and drowned the  sober voices of the town-clocks as they chimed out half-past eight.
  They drove up to a door round which a crowd of persons were collected,  and there stopped.
    'What's this?' said the single gentleman thrusting out his head.
  'Is  anything the matter here?'    'A wedding Sir, a wedding!' cried several voices.
  'Hurrah!'    The single gentleman, rather bewildered by finding himself the centre  of this noisy throng, alighted with the assistance of one of the  postilions, and handed out Kit's mother, at sight of whom the populace  cried out, 'Here's another wedding!' and roared and leaped for joy.
    'The world has gone mad, I think,' said the single gentleman, pressing  through the concourse with his supposed bride.
  'Stand back here, will  you, and let me knock.
'    Anything that makes a noise is satisfactory to a crowd.
  A score of  dirty hands were raised directly to knock for him, and seldom has a  knocker of equal powers been made to produce more deafening sounds than  this particular engine on the occasion in question.
  Having rendered  these voluntary services, the throng modestly retired a little,  preferring that the single gentleman should bear their consequences  alone.
    'Now, sir, what do you want!' said a man with a large white bow at his  button-hole, opening the door, and confronting him with a very stoical  aspect.
    'Who has been married here, my friend?' said the single gentleman.
    'I have.
'    'You! and to whom in the devil's name?'    'What right have you to ask?' returned the bridegroom, eyeing him from  top to toe.
    'What right!' cried the single gentleman, drawing the arm of Kit's  mother more tightly through his own, for that good woman evidently had  it in contemplation to run away.
  'A right you little dream of.
  Mind,  good people, if this fellow has been marrying a minor--tut, tut, that  can't be.
  Where is the child you have here, my good fellow.
  You call  her Nell.
  Where is she?'    As he propounded this question, which Kit's mother echoed, somebody in  a room near at hand, uttered a great shriek, and a stout lady in a  white dress came running to the door, and supported herself upon the  bridegroom's arm.
    'Where is she!' cried this lady.
  'What news have you brought me?  What  has become of her?'    The single gentleman started back, and gazed upon the face of the late  Mrs Jarley (that morning wedded to the philosophic George, to the  eternal wrath and despair of Mr Slum the poet), with looks of  conflicting apprehension, disappointment, and incredulity.
  At length  he stammered out,    'I ask YOU where she is?  What do you mean?'    'Oh sir!' cried the bride, 'If you have come here to do her any good,  why weren't you here a week ago?'    'She is not--not dead?' said the person to whom she addressed herself,  turning very pale.
    'No, not so bad as that.
'    'I thank God!' cried the single gentleman feebly.
  'Let me come in.
'    They drew back to admit him, and when he had entered, closed the door.
    'You see in me, good people,' he said, turning to the newly-married  couple, 'one to whom life itself is not dearer than the two persons  whom I seek.
  They would not know me.
  My features are strange to them,  but if they or either of them are here, take this good woman with you,  and let them see her first, for her they both know.
  If you deny them  from any mistaken regard or fear for them, judge of my intentions by  their recognition of this person as their old humble friend.
'    'I always said it!' cried the bride, 'I knew she was not a common  child!  Alas, sir! we have no power to help you, for all that we could  do, has been tried in vain.
'    With that, they related to him, without disguise or concealment, all  that they knew of Nell and her grandfather, from their first meeting  with them, down to the time of their sudden disappearance; adding  (which was quite true) that they had made every possible effort to  trace them, but without success; having been at first in great alarm  for their safety, as well as on account of the suspicions to which they  themselves might one day be exposed in consequence of their abrupt  departure.
  They dwelt upon the old man's imbecility of mind, upon the  uneasiness the child had always testified when he was absent, upon the  company he had been supposed to keep, and upon the increased depression  which had gradually crept over her and changed her both in health and  spirits.
  Whether she had missed the old man in the night, and knowing  or conjecturing whither he had bent his steps, had gone in pursuit, or  whether they had left the house together, they had no means of  determining.
  Certain they considered it, that there was but slender  prospect left of hearing of them again, and that whether their flight  originated with the old man, or with the child, there was now no hope  of their return.
  To all this, the single gentleman listened with the  air of a man quite borne down by grief and disappointment.
  He shed  tears when they spoke of the grandfather, and appeared in deep  affliction.
    Not to protract this portion of our narrative, and to make short work  of a long story, let it be briefly written that before the interview  came to a close, the single gentleman deemed he had sufficient evidence  of having been told the truth, and that he endeavoured to force upon  the bride and bridegroom an acknowledgment of their kindness to the  unfriended child, which, however, they steadily declined accepting.
  In  the end, the happy couple jolted away in the caravan to spend their  honeymoon in a country excursion; and the single gentleman and Kit's  mother stood ruefully before their carriage-door.
    'Where shall we drive you, sir?' said the post-boy.
    'You may drive me,' said the single gentleman, 'to the--' He was not  going to add 'inn,' but he added it for the sake of Kit's mother; and  to the inn they went.
    Rumours had already got abroad that the little girl who used to show  the wax-work, was the child of great people who had been stolen from  her parents in infancy, and had only just been traced.
  Opinion was  divided whether she was the daughter of a prince, a duke, an earl, a  viscount, or a baron, but all agreed upon the main fact, and that the  single gentleman was her father; and all bent forward to catch a  glimpse, though it were only of the tip of his noble nose, as he rode  away, desponding, in his four-horse chaise.
    What would he have given to know, and what sorrow would have been saved  if he had only known, that at that moment both child and grandfather  were seated in the old church porch, patiently awaiting the  schoolmaster's return!              Popular rumour concerning the single gentleman and his errand,  travelling from mouth to mouth, and waxing stronger in the marvellous  as it was bandied about--for your popular rumour, unlike the rolling  stone of the proverb, is one which gathers a deal of moss in its  wanderings up and down--occasioned his dismounting at the inn-door to  be looked upon as an exciting and attractive spectacle, which could  scarcely be enough admired; and drew together a large concourse of  idlers, who having recently been, as it were, thrown out of employment  by the closing of the wax-work and the completion of the nuptial  ceremonies, considered his arrival as little else than a special  providence, and hailed it with demonstrations of the liveliest joy.
    Not at all participating in the general sensation, but wearing the  depressed and wearied look of one who sought to meditate on his  disappointment in silence and privacy, the single gentleman alighted,  and handed out Kit's mother with a gloomy politeness which impressed  the lookers-on extremely.
  That done, he gave her his arm and escorted  her into the house, while several active waiters ran on before as a  skirmishing party, to clear the way and to show the room which was  ready for their reception.
    'Any room will do,' said the single gentleman.
  'Let it be near at  hand, that's all.
'    'Close here, sir, if you please to walk this way.
'    'Would the gentleman like this room?' said a voice, as a little  out-of-the-way door at the foot of the well staircase flew briskly open  and a head popped out.
  'He's quite welcome to it.
  He's as welcome as  flowers in May, or coals at Christmas.
  Would you like this room, sir?  Honour me by walking in.
  Do me the favour, pray.
'    'Goodness gracious me!' cried Kit's mother, falling back in extreme  surprise, 'only think of this!'    She had some reason to be astonished, for the person who proffered the  gracious invitation was no other than Daniel Quilp.
  The little door  out of which he had thrust his head was close to the inn larder; and  there he stood, bowing with grotesque politeness; as much at his ease  as if the door were that of his own house; blighting all the legs of  mutton and cold roast fowls by his close companionship, and looking  like the evil genius of the cellars come from underground upon some  work of mischief.
    'Would you do me the honour?' said Quilp.
    'I prefer being alone,' replied the single gentleman.
    'Oh!' said Quilp.
  And with that, he darted in again with one jerk and  clapped the little door to, like a figure in a Dutch clock when the  hour strikes.
    'Why it was only last night, sir,' whispered Kit's mother, 'that I left  him in Little Bethel.
'    'Indeed!' said her fellow-passenger.
  'When did that person come here,  waiter?'    'Come down by the night-coach, this morning, sir.
'    'Humph!  And when is he going?'    'Can't say, sir, really.
  When the chambermaid asked him just now if he  should want a bed, sir, he first made faces at her, and then wanted to  kiss her.
'    'Beg him to walk this way,' said the single gentleman.
  'I should be  glad to exchange a word with him, tell him.
  Beg him to come at once,  do you hear?'    The man stared on receiving these instructions, for the single  gentleman had not only displayed as much astonishment as Kit's mother  at sight of the dwarf, but, standing in no fear of him, had been at  less pains to conceal his dislike and repugnance.
  He departed on his  errand, however, and immediately returned, ushering in its object.
    'Your servant, sir,' said the dwarf, 'I encountered your messenger  half-way.
  I thought you'd allow me to pay my compliments to you.
  I  hope you're well.
  I hope you're very well.
'    There was a short pause, while the dwarf, with half-shut eyes and  puckered face, stood waiting for an answer.
  Receiving none, he turned  towards his more familiar acquaintance.
    'Christopher's mother!' he cried.
  'Such a dear lady, such a worthy  woman, so blest in her honest son!  How is Christopher's mother?  Have  change of air and scene improved her?  Her little family too, and  Christopher?  Do they thrive?  Do they flourish?  Are they growing into  worthy citizens, eh?'    Making his voice ascend in the scale with every succeeding question, Mr  Quilp finished in a shrill squeak, and subsided into the panting look  which was customary with him, and which, whether it were assumed or  natural, had equally the effect of banishing all expression from his  face, and rendering it, as far as it afforded any index to his mood or  meaning, a perfect blank.
    'Mr Quilp,' said the single gentleman.
    The dwarf put his hand to his great flapped ear, and counterfeited the  closest attention.
    'We two have met before--'    'Surely,' cried Quilp, nodding his head.
  'Oh surely, sir.
  Such an  honour and pleasure--it's both, Christopher's mother, it's both--is  not to be forgotten so soon.
  By no means!'    'You may remember that the day I arrived in London, and found the house  to which I drove, empty and deserted, I was directed by some of the  neighbours to you, and waited upon you without stopping for rest or  refreshment?'    'How precipitate that was, and yet what an earnest and vigorous  measure!' said Quilp, conferring with himself, in imitation of his  friend Mr Sampson Brass.
    'I found,' said the single gentleman, 'you most unaccountably, in  possession of everything that had so recently belonged to another man,  and that other man, who up to the time of your entering upon his  property had been looked upon as affluent, reduced to sudden beggary,  and driven from house and home.
'    'We had warrant for what we did, my good sir,' rejoined Quilp, 'we had  our warrant.
  Don't say driven either.
  He went of his own  accord--vanished in the night, sir.
'    'No matter,' said the single gentleman angrily.
  'He was gone.
'    'Yes, he was gone,' said Quilp, with the same exasperating composure.
  'No doubt he was gone.
  The only question was, where.
  And it's a  question still.
'    'Now, what am I to think,' said the single gentleman, sternly regarding  him, 'of you, who, plainly indisposed to give me any information  then--nay, obviously holding back, and sheltering yourself with all  kinds of cunning, trickery, and evasion--are dogging my footsteps now?'    'I dogging!' cried Quilp.
    'Why, are you not?' returned his questioner, fretted into a state of  the utmost irritation.
  'Were you not a few hours since, sixty miles  off, and in the chapel to which this good woman goes to say her  prayers?'    'She was there too, I think?' said Quilp, still perfectly unmoved.
  'I  might say, if I was inclined to be rude, how do I know but you are  dogging MY footsteps.
  Yes, I was at chapel.
  What then?  I've read in  books that pilgrims were used to go to chapel before they went on  journeys, to put up petitions for their safe return.
  Wise men!  journeys are very perilous--especially outside the coach.
  Wheels come  off, horses take fright, coachmen drive too fast, coaches overturn.
  I  always go to chapel before I start on journeys.
  It's the last thing I  do on such occasions, indeed.
'    That Quilp lied most heartily in this speech, it needed no very great  penetration to discover, although for anything that he suffered to  appear in his face, voice, or manner, he might have been clinging to  the truth with the quiet constancy of a martyr.
    'In the name of all that's calculated to drive one crazy, man,' said  the unfortunate single gentleman, 'have you not, for some reason of  your own, taken upon yourself my errand?  don't you know with what  object I have come here, and if you do know, can you throw no light  upon it?'    'You think I'm a conjuror, sir,' replied Quilp, shrugging up his  shoulders.
  'If I was, I should tell my own fortune--and make it.
'    'Ah! we have said all we need say, I see,' returned the other, throwing  himself impatiently upon a sofa.
  'Pray leave us, if you please.
'    'Willingly,' returned Quilp.
  'Most willingly.
  Christopher's mother,  my good soul, farewell.
  A pleasant journey--back, sir.
  Ahem!'    With these parting words, and with a grin upon his features altogether  indescribable, but which seemed to be compounded of every monstrous  grimace of which men or monkeys are capable, the dwarf slowly retreated  and closed the door behind him.
    'Oho!' he said when he had regained his own room, and sat himself down  in a chair with his arms akimbo.
  'Oho!  Are you there, my friend?  In-deed!'    Chuckling as though in very great glee, and recompensing himself for  the restraint he had lately put upon his countenance by twisting it  into all imaginable varieties of ugliness, Mr Quilp, rocking himself to  and fro in his chair and nursing his left leg at the same time, fell  into certain meditations, of which it may be necessary to relate the  substance.
    First, he reviewed the circumstances which had led to his repairing to  that spot, which were briefly these.
  Dropping in at Mr Sampson Brass's  office on the previous evening, in the absence of that gentleman and  his learned sister, he had lighted upon Mr Swiveller, who chanced at  the moment to be sprinkling a glass of warm gin and water on the dust  of the law, and to be moistening his clay, as the phrase goes, rather  copiously.
  But as clay in the abstract, when too much moistened,  becomes of a weak and uncertain consistency, breaking down in  unexpected places, retaining impressions but faintly, and preserving no  strength or steadiness of character, so Mr Swiveller's clay, having  imbibed a considerable quantity of moisture, was in a very loose and  slippery state, insomuch that the various ideas impressed upon it were  fast losing their distinctive character, and running into each other.
  It is not uncommon for human clay in this condition to value itself  above all things upon its great prudence and sagacity; and Mr  Swiveller, especially prizing himself upon these qualities, took  occasion to remark that he had made strange discoveries in connection  with the single gentleman who lodged above, which he had determined to  keep within his own bosom, and which neither tortures nor cajolery  should ever induce him to reveal.
  Of this determination Mr Quilp  expressed his high approval, and setting himself in the same breath to  goad Mr Swiveller on to further hints, soon made out that the single  gentleman had been seen in communication with Kit, and that this was  the secret which was never to be disclosed.
    Possessed of this piece of information, Mr Quilp directly supposed that  the single gentleman above stairs must be the same individual who had  waited on him, and having assured himself by further inquiries that  this surmise was correct, had no difficulty in arriving at the  conclusion that the intent and object of his correspondence with Kit  was the recovery of his old client and the child.
  Burning with  curiosity to know what proceedings were afoot, he resolved to pounce  upon Kit's mother as the person least able to resist his arts, and  consequently the most likely to be entrapped into such revelations as  he sought; so taking an abrupt leave of Mr Swiveller, he hurried to her  house.
  The good woman being from home, he made inquiries of a  neighbour, as Kit himself did soon afterwards, and being directed to  the chapel be took himself there, in order to waylay her, at the  conclusion of the service.
    He had not sat in the chapel more than a quarter of an hour, and with  his eyes piously fixed upon the ceiling was chuckling inwardly over the  joke of his being there at all, when Kit himself appeared.
  Watchful as  a lynx, one glance showed the dwarf that he had come on business.
  Absorbed in appearance, as we have seen, and feigning a profound  abstraction, he noted every circumstance of his behaviour, and when he  withdrew with his family, shot out after him.
  In fine, he traced them  to the notary's house; learnt the destination of the carriage from one  of the postilions; and knowing that a fast night-coach started for the  same place, at the very hour which was on the point of striking, from a  street hard by, darted round to the coach-office without more ado, and  took his seat upon the roof.
  After passing and repassing the carriage  on the road, and being passed and repassed by it sundry times in the  course of the night, according as their stoppages were longer or  shorter; or their rate of travelling varied, they reached the town  almost together.
  Quilp kept the chaise in sight, mingled with the  crowd, learnt the single gentleman's errand, and its failure, and  having possessed himself of all that it was material to know, hurried  off, reached the inn before him, had the interview just now detailed,  and shut himself up in the little room in which he hastily reviewed all  these occurrences.
    'You are there, are you, my friend?' he repeated, greedily biting his  nails.
  'I am suspected and thrown aside, and Kit's the confidential  agent, is he?  I shall have to dispose of him, I fear.
  If we had come  up with them this morning,' he continued, after a thoughtful pause, 'I  was ready to prove a pretty good claim.
  I could have made my profit.
  But for these canting hypocrites, the lad and his mother, I could get  this fiery gentleman as comfortably into my net as our old friend--our  mutual friend, ha! ha!--and chubby, rosy Nell.
  At the worst, it's a  golden opportunity, not to be lost.
  Let us find them first, and I'll  find means of draining you of some of your superfluous cash, sir, while  there are prison bars, and bolts, and locks, to keep your friend or  kinsman safely.
  I hate your virtuous people!' said the dwarf, throwing  off a bumper of brandy, and smacking his lips, 'ah! I hate 'em every  one!'    This was not a mere empty vaunt, but a deliberate avowal of his real  sentiments; for Mr Quilp, who loved nobody, had by little and little  come to hate everybody nearly or remotely connected with his ruined  client:--the old man himself, because he had been able to deceive him  and elude his vigilance--the child, because she was the object of Mrs  Quilp's commiseration and constant self-reproach--the single gentleman,  because of his unconcealed aversion to himself--Kit and his mother,  most mortally, for the reasons shown.
  Above and beyond that general  feeling of opposition to them, which would have been inseparable from  his ravenous desire to enrich himself by these altered circumstances,  Daniel Quilp hated them every one.
    In this amiable mood, Mr Quilp enlivened himself and his hatreds with  more brandy, and then, changing his quarters, withdrew to an obscure  alehouse, under cover of which seclusion he instituted all possible  inquiries that might lead to the discovery of the old man and his  grandchild.
  But all was in vain.
  Not the slightest trace or clue  could be obtained.
  They had left the town by night; no one had seen  them go; no one had met them on the road; the driver of no coach, cart,  or waggon, had seen any travellers answering their description; nobody  had fallen in with them, or heard of them.
  Convinced at last that for  the present all such attempts were hopeless, he appointed two or three  scouts, with promises of large rewards in case of their forwarding him  any intelligence, and returned to London by next day's coach.
    It was some gratification to Mr Quilp to find, as he took his place  upon the roof, that Kit's mother was alone inside; from which  circumstance he derived in the course of the journey much cheerfulness  of spirit, inasmuch as her solitary condition enabled him to terrify  her with many extraordinary annoyances; such as hanging over the side  of the coach at the risk of his life, and staring in with his great  goggle eyes, which seemed in hers the more horrible from his face being  upside down; dodging her in this way from one window to another;  getting nimbly down whenever they changed horses and thrusting his head  in at the window with a dismal squint: which ingenious tortures had  such an effect upon Mrs Nubbles, that she was quite unable for the time  to resist the belief that Mr Quilp did in his own person represent and  embody that Evil Power, who was so vigorously attacked at Little  Bethel, and who, by reason of her backslidings in respect of Astley's  and oysters, was now frolicsome and rampant.
    Kit, having been apprised by letter of his mother's intended return,  was waiting for her at the coach-office; and great was his surprise  when he saw, leering over the coachman's shoulder like some familiar  demon, invisible to all eyes but his, the well-known face of Quilp.
    'How are you, Christopher?' croaked the dwarf from the coach-top.
  'All  right, Christopher.
  Mother's inside.
'    'Why, how did he come here, mother?' whispered Kit.
    'I don't know how he came or why, my dear,' rejoined Mrs Nubbles,  dismounting with her son's assistance, 'but he has been a terrifying of  me out of my seven senses all this blessed day.
'    'He has?' cried Kit.
    'You wouldn't believe it, that you wouldn't,' replied his mother, 'but  don't say a word to him, for I really don't believe he's human.
  Hush!  Don't turn round as if I was talking of him, but he's a squinting at me  now in the full blaze of the coach-lamp, quite awful!'    In spite of his mother's injunction, Kit turned sharply round to look.
  Mr Quilp was serenely gazing at the stars, quite absorbed in celestial  contemplation.
    'Oh, he's the artfullest creetur!' cried Mrs Nubbles.
  'But come away.
  Don't speak to him for the world.
'    'Yes I will, mother.
  What nonsense.
  I say, sir--'    Mr Quilp affected to start, and looked smilingly round.
    'You let my mother alone, will you?' said Kit.
  'How dare you tease a  poor lone woman like her, making her miserable and melancholy as if she  hadn't got enough to make her so, without you.
  An't you ashamed of  yourself, you little monster?'    'Monster!' said Quilp inwardly, with a smile.
  'Ugliest dwarf that  could be seen anywhere for a penny--monster--ah!'    'You show her any of your impudence again,' resumed Kit, shouldering  the bandbox, 'and I tell you what, Mr Quilp, I won't bear with you any  more.
  You have no right to do it; I'm sure we never interfered with  you.
  This isn't the first time; and if ever you worry or frighten her  again, you'll oblige me (though I should be very sorry to do it, on  account of your size) to beat you.
'    Quilp said not a word in reply, but walking so close to Kit as to bring  his eyes within two or three inches of his face, looked fixedly at him,  retreated a little distance without averting his gaze, approached  again, again withdrew, and so on for half-a-dozen times, like a head in  a phantasmagoria.
  Kit stood his ground as if in expectation of an  immediate assault, but finding that nothing came of these gestures,  snapped his fingers and walked away; his mother dragging him off as  fast as she could, and, even in the midst of his news of little Jacob  and the baby, looking anxiously over her shoulder to see if Quilp were  following.
              Kit's mother might have spared herself the trouble of looking back so  often, for nothing was further from Mr Quilp's thoughts than any  intention of pursuing her and her son, or renewing the quarrel with  which they had parted.
  He went his way, whistling from time to time  some fragments of a tune; and with a face quite tranquil and composed,  jogged pleasantly towards home; entertaining himself as he went with  visions of the fears and terrors of Mrs Quilp, who, having received no  intelligence of him for three whole days and two nights, and having had  no previous notice of his absence, was doubtless by that time in a  state of distraction, and constantly fainting away with anxiety and  grief.
    This facetious probability was so congenial to the dwarf's humour, and  so exquisitely amusing to him, that he laughed as he went along until  the tears ran down his cheeks; and more than once, when he found  himself in a bye-street, vented his delight in a shrill scream, which  greatly terrifying any lonely passenger, who happened to be walking on  before him expecting nothing so little, increased his mirth, and made  him remarkably cheerful and light-hearted.
    In this happy flow of spirits, Mr Quilp reached Tower Hill, when,  gazing up at the window of his own sitting-room, he thought he descried  more light than is usual in a house of mourning.
  Drawing nearer, and  listening attentively, he could hear several voices in earnest  conversation, among which he could distinguish, not only those of his  wife and mother-in-law, but the tongues of men.
    'Ha!' cried the jealous dwarf, 'What's this!  Do they entertain  visitors while I'm away!'    A smothered cough from above, was the reply.
  He felt in his pockets  for his latch-key, but had forgotten it.
  There was no resource but to  knock at the door.
    'A light in the passage,' said Quilp, peeping through the keyhole.
  'A  very soft knock; and, by your leave, my lady, I may yet steal upon you  unawares.
  Soho!'    A very low and gentle rap received no answer from within.
  But after a  second application to the knocker, no louder than the first, the door  was softly opened by the boy from the wharf, whom Quilp instantly  gagged with one hand, and dragged into the street with the other.
    'You'll throttle me, master,' whispered the boy.
  'Let go, will you.
'    'Who's up stairs, you dog?' retorted Quilp in the same tone.
  'Tell me.
  And don't speak above your breath, or I'll choke you in good earnest.
'    The boy could only point to the window, and reply with a stifled  giggle, expressive of such intense enjoyment, that Quilp clutched him  by the throat and might have carried his threat into execution, or at  least have made very good progress towards that end, but for the boy's  nimbly extricating himself from his grasp, and fortifying himself  behind the nearest post, at which, after some fruitless attempts to  catch him by the hair of the head, his master was obliged to come to a  parley.
    'Will you answer me?' said Quilp.
  'What's going on, above?'    'You won't let one speak,' replied the boy.
  'They--ha, ha, ha!--they  think you're--you're dead.
  Ha ha ha!'    'Dead!' cried Quilp, relaxing into a grim laugh himself.
  'No.
  Do  they?  Do they really, you dog?'    'They think you're--you're drowned,' replied the boy, who in his  malicious nature had a strong infusion of his master.
  'You was last  seen on the brink of the wharf, and they think you tumbled over.
  Ha  ha!'    The prospect of playing the spy under such delicious circumstances, and  of disappointing them all by walking in alive, gave more delight to  Quilp than the greatest stroke of good fortune could possibly have  inspired him with.
  He was no less tickled than his hopeful assistant,  and they both stood for some seconds, grinning and gasping and wagging  their heads at each other, on either side of the post, like an  unmatchable pair of Chinese idols.
    'Not a word,' said Quilp, making towards the door on tiptoe.
  'Not a  sound, not so much as a creaking board, or a stumble against a cobweb.
  Drowned, eh, Mrs Quilp!  Drowned!'    So saying, he blew out the candle, kicked off his shoes, and groped his  way up stairs; leaving his delighted young friend in an ecstasy of  summersets on the pavement.
    The bedroom-door on the staircase being unlocked, Mr Quilp slipped in,  and planted himself behind the door of communication between that  chamber and the sitting-room, which standing ajar to render both more  airy, and having a very convenient chink (of which he had often availed  himself for purposes of espial, and had indeed enlarged with his  pocket-knife), enabled him not only to hear, but to see distinctly,  what was passing.
    Applying his eye to this convenient place, he descried Mr Brass seated  at the table with pen, ink, and paper, and the case-bottle of rum--his  own case-bottle, and his own particular Jamaica--convenient to his  hand; with hot water, fragrant lemons, white lump sugar, and all things  fitting; from which choice materials, Sampson, by no means insensible  to their claims upon his attention, had compounded a mighty glass of  punch reeking hot; which he was at that very moment stirring up with a  teaspoon, and contemplating with looks in which a faint assumption of  sentimental regret, struggled but weakly with a bland and comfortable  joy.
  At the same table, with both her elbows upon it, was Mrs Jiniwin;  no longer sipping other people's punch feloniously with teaspoons, but  taking deep draughts from a jorum of her own; while her daughter--not  exactly with ashes on her head, or sackcloth on her back, but  preserving a very decent and becoming appearance of sorrow  nevertheless--was reclining in an easy chair, and soothing her grief  with a smaller allowance of the same glib liquid.
  There were also  present, a couple of water-side men, bearing between them certain  machines called drags; even these fellows were accommodated with a  stiff glass a-piece; and as they drank with a great relish, and were  naturally of a red-nosed, pimple-faced, convivial look, their presence  rather increased than detracted from that decided appearance of  comfort, which was the great characteristic of the party.
    'If I could poison that dear old lady's rum and water,' murmured Quilp,  'I'd die happy.
'    'Ah!' said Mr Brass, breaking the silence, and raising his eyes to the  ceiling with a sigh, 'Who knows but he may be looking down upon us now!  Who knows but he may be surveying of us from--from somewheres or  another, and contemplating us with a watchful eye!  Oh Lor!'    Here Mr Brass stopped to drink half his punch, and then resumed;  looking at the other half, as he spoke, with a dejected smile.
    'I can almost fancy,' said the lawyer shaking his head, 'that I see his  eye glistening down at the very bottom of my liquor.
  When shall we  look upon his like again?  Never, never!' One minute we are  here'--holding his tumbler before his eyes--'the next we are  there'--gulping down its contents, and striking himself emphatically a  little below the chest--'in the silent tomb.
  To think that I should be  drinking his very rum!  It seems like a dream.
'    With the view, no doubt, of testing the reality of his position, Mr  Brass pushed his tumbler as he spoke towards Mrs Jiniwin for the  purpose of being replenished; and turned towards the attendant mariners.
    'The search has been quite unsuccessful then?'    'Quite, master.
  But I should say that if he turns up anywhere, he'll  come ashore somewhere about Grinidge to-morrow, at ebb tide, eh, mate?'    The other gentleman assented, observing that he was expected at the  Hospital, and that several pensioners would be ready to receive him  whenever he arrived.
    'Then we have nothing for it but resignation,' said Mr Brass; 'nothing  but resignation and expectation.
  It would be a comfort to have his  body; it would be a dreary comfort.
'    'Oh, beyond a doubt,' assented Mrs Jiniwin hastily; 'if we once had  that, we should be quite sure.
'    'With regard to the descriptive advertisement,' said Sampson Brass,  taking up his pen.
  'It is a melancholy pleasure to recall his traits.
  Respecting his legs now--?'    'Crooked, certainly,' said Mrs Jiniwin.
  'Do you think they WERE  crooked?' said Brass, in an insinuating tone.
  'I think I see them now  coming up the street very wide apart, in nankeen' pantaloons a little  shrunk and without straps.
  Ah! what a vale of tears we live in.
 Do we  say crooked?'    'I think they were a little so,' observed Mrs Quilp with a sob.
    'Legs crooked,' said Brass, writing as he spoke.
  'Large head, short  body, legs crooked--'    'Very crooked,' suggested Mrs Jiniwin.
    'We'll not say very crooked, ma'am,' said Brass piously.
  'Let us not  bear hard upon the weaknesses of the deceased.
  He is gone, ma'am, to  where his legs will never come in question.
--We will content ourselves  with crooked, Mrs Jiniwin.
'    'I thought you wanted the truth,' said the old lady.
  'That's all.
'    'Bless your eyes, how I love you,' muttered Quilp.
  'There she goes  again.
  Nothing but punch!'    'This is an occupation,' said the lawyer, laying down his pen and  emptying his glass, 'which seems to bring him before my eyes like the  Ghost of Hamlet's father, in the very clothes that he wore on  work-a-days.
  His coat, his waistcoat, his shoes and stockings, his  trousers, his hat, his wit and humour, his pathos and his umbrella, all  come before me like visions of my youth.
  His linen!' said Mr Brass  smiling fondly at the wall, 'his linen which was always of a particular  colour, for such was his whim and fancy--how plain I see his linen now!'    'You had better go on, sir,' said Mrs Jiniwin impatiently.
    'True, ma'am, true,' cried Mr Brass.
  'Our faculties must not freeze  with grief.
  I'll trouble you for a little more of that, ma'am.
  A  question now arises, with relation to his nose.
'    'Flat,' said Mrs Jiniwin.
    'Aquiline!' cried Quilp, thrusting in his head, and striking the  feature with his fist.
  'Aquiline, you hag.
  Do you see it?  Do you  call this flat?  Do you?  Eh?'    'Oh capital, capital!' shouted Brass, from the mere force of habit.
  'Excellent!  How very good he is!  He's a most remarkable man--so  extremely whimsical!  Such an amazing power of taking people by  surprise!'    Quilp paid no regard whatever to these compliments, nor to the dubious  and frightened look into which the lawyer gradually subsided, nor to  the shrieks of his wife and mother-in-law, nor to the latter's running  from the room, nor to the former's fainting away.
  Keeping his eye  fixed on Sampson Brass, he walked up to the table, and beginning with  his glass, drank off the contents, and went regularly round until he  had emptied the other two, when he seized the case-bottle, and hugging  it under his arm, surveyed him with a most extraordinary leer.
    'Not yet, Sampson,' said Quilp.
  'Not just yet!'    'Oh very good indeed!' cried Brass, recovering his spirits a little.
  'Ha ha ha!  Oh exceedingly good!  There's not another man alive who  could carry it off like that.
  A most difficult position to carry off.
  But he has such a flow of good-humour, such an amazing flow!'    'Good night,' said the dwarf, nodding expressively.
    'Good night, sir, good night,' cried the lawyer, retreating backwards  towards the door.
  'This is a joyful occasion indeed, extremely joyful.
  Ha ha ha! oh very rich, very rich indeed, remarkably so!'    Waiting until Mr Brass's ejaculations died away in the distance (for he  continued to pour them out, all the way down stairs), Quilp advanced  towards the two men, who yet lingered in a kind of stupid amazement.
    'Have you been dragging the river all day, gentlemen?' said the dwarf,  holding the door open with great politeness.
    'And yesterday too, master.
'    'Dear me, you've had a deal of trouble.
  Pray consider everything yours  that you find upon the--upon the body.
  Good night!'    The men looked at each other, but had evidently no inclination to argue  the point just then, and shuffled out of the room.
  The speedy  clearance effected, Quilp locked the doors; and still embracing the  case-bottle with shrugged-up shoulders and folded arms, stood looking  at his insensible wife like a dismounted nightmare.
              Matrimonial differences are usually discussed by the parties concerned  in the form of dialogue, in which the lady bears at least her full half  share.
  Those of Mr and Mrs Quilp, however, were an exception to the  general rule; the remarks which they occasioned being limited to a long  soliloquy on the part of the gentleman, with perhaps a few deprecatory  observations from the lady, not extending beyond a trembling  monosyllable uttered at long intervals, and in a very submissive and  humble tone.
  On the present occasion, Mrs Quilp did not for a long  time venture even on this gentle defence, but when she had recovered  from her fainting-fit, sat in a tearful silence, meekly listening to  the reproaches of her lord and master.
    Of these Mr Quilp delivered himself with the utmost animation and  rapidity, and with so many distortions of limb and feature, that even  his wife, although tolerably well accustomed to his proficiency in  these respects, was well-nigh beside herself with alarm.
  But the  Jamaica rum, and the joy of having occasioned a heavy disappointment,  by degrees cooled Mr Quilp's wrath; which from being at savage heat,  dropped slowly to the bantering or chuckling point, at which it  steadily remained.
    'So you thought I was dead and gone, did you?' said Quilp.
  'You  thought you were a widow, eh?  Ha, ha, ha, you jade.
'    'Indeed, Quilp,' returned his wife.
  'I'm very sorry--'    'Who doubts it!' cried the dwarf.
  'You very sorry! to be sure you are.
  Who doubts that you're VERY sorry!'    'I don't mean sorry that you have come home again alive and well,' said  his wife, 'but sorry that I should have been led into such a belief.
  I  am glad to see you, Quilp; indeed I am.
'    In truth Mrs Quilp did seem a great deal more glad to behold her lord  than might have been expected, and did evince a degree of interest in  his safety which, all things considered, was rather unaccountable.
  Upon Quilp, however, this circumstance made no impression, farther than  as it moved him to snap his fingers close to his wife's eyes, with  divers grins of triumph and derision.
    'How could you go away so long, without saying a word to me or letting  me hear of you or know anything about you?' asked the poor little  woman, sobbing.
  'How could you be so cruel, Quilp?'    'How could I be so cruel! cruel!' cried the dwarf.
  'Because I was in  the humour.
  I'm in the humour now.
  I shall be cruel when I like.
  I'm  going away again.
'    'Not again!'    'Yes, again.
  I'm going away now.
  I'm off directly.
  I mean to go and  live wherever the fancy seizes me--at the wharf--at the  counting-house--and be a jolly bachelor.
  You were a widow in  anticipation.
  Damme,' screamed the dwarf, 'I'll be a bachelor in  earnest.
'    'You can't be serious, Quilp,' sobbed his wife.
    'I tell you,' said the dwarf, exulting in his project, 'that I'll be a  bachelor, a devil-may-care bachelor; and I'll have my bachelor's hall  at the counting-house, and at such times come near it if you dare.
  And  mind too that I don't pounce in upon you at unseasonable hours again,  for I'll be a spy upon you, and come and go like a mole or a weazel.
  Tom Scott--where's Tom Scott?'    'Here I am, master,' cried the voice of the boy, as Quilp threw up the  window.
    'Wait there, you dog,' returned the dwarf, 'to carry a bachelor's  portmanteau.
  Pack it up, Mrs Quilp.
  Knock up the dear old lady to  help; knock her up.
  Halloa there!  Halloa!'    With these exclamations, Mr Quilp caught up the poker, and hurrying to  the door of the good lady's sleeping-closet, beat upon it therewith  until she awoke in inexpressible terror, thinking that her amiable  son-in-law surely intended to murder her in justification of the legs  she had slandered.
  Impressed with this idea, she was no sooner fairly  awake than she screamed violently, and would have quickly precipitated  herself out of the window and through a neighbouring skylight, if her  daughter had not hastened in to undeceive her, and implore her  assistance.
  Somewhat reassured by her account of the service she was  required to render, Mrs Jiniwin made her appearance in a flannel  dressing-gown; and both mother and daughter, trembling with terror and  cold--for the night was now far advanced--obeyed Mr Quilp's directions  in submissive silence.
  Prolonging his preparations as much as  possible, for their greater comfort, that eccentric gentleman  superintended the packing of his wardrobe, and having added to it with  his own hands, a plate, knife and fork, spoon, teacup and saucer, and  other small household matters of that nature, strapped up the  portmanteau, took it on his shoulders, and actually marched off without  another word, and with the case-bottle (which he had never once put  down) still tightly clasped under his arm.
  Consigning his heavier  burden to the care of Tom Scott when he reached the street, taking a  dram from the bottle for his own encouragement, and giving the boy a  rap on the head with it as a small taste for himself, Quilp very  deliberately led the way to the wharf, and reached it at between three  and four o'clock in the morning.
    'Snug!' said Quilp, when he had groped his way to the wooden  counting-house, and opened the door with a key he carried about with  him.
  'Beautifully snug!  Call me at eight, you dog.
'    With no more formal leave-taking or explanation, he clutched the  portmanteau, shut the door on his attendant, and climbing on the desk,  and rolling himself up as round as a hedgehog, in an old boat-cloak,  fell fast asleep.
    Being roused in the morning at the appointed time, and roused with  difficulty, after his late fatigues, Quilp instructed Tom Scott to make  a fire in the yard of sundry pieces of old timber, and to prepare some  coffee for breakfast; for the better furnishing of which repast he  entrusted him with certain small moneys, to be expended in the purchase  of hot rolls, butter, sugar, Yarmouth bloaters, and other articles of  housekeeping; so that in a few minutes a savoury meal was smoking on  the board.
  With this substantial comfort, the dwarf regaled himself to  his heart's content; and being highly satisfied with this free and  gipsy mode of life (which he had often meditated, as offering, whenever  he chose to avail himself of it, an agreeable freedom from the  restraints of matrimony, and a choice means of keeping Mrs Quilp and  her mother in a state of incessant agitation and suspense), bestirred  himself to improve his retreat, and render it more commodious and  comfortable.
    With this view, he issued forth to a place hard by, where sea-stores  were sold, purchased a second-hand hammock, and had it slung in  seamanlike fashion from the ceiling of the counting-house.
  He also  caused to be erected, in the same mouldy cabin, an old ship's stove  with a rusty funnel to carry the smoke through the roof; and these  arrangements completed, surveyed them with ineffable delight.
    'I've got a country-house like Robinson Crusoe,' said the dwarf, ogling  the accommodations; 'a solitary, sequestered, desolate-island sort of  spot, where I can be quite alone when I have business on hand, and be  secure from all spies and listeners.
  Nobody near me here, but rats,  and they are fine stealthy secret fellows.
  I shall be as merry as a  grig among these gentry.
  I'll look out for one like Christopher, and  poison him--ha, ha, ha!  Business though--business--we must be mindful  of business in the midst of pleasure, and the time has flown this  morning, I declare.
'    Enjoining Tom Scott to await his return, and not to stand upon his  head, or throw a summerset, or so much as walk upon his hands  meanwhile, on pain of lingering torments, the dwarf threw himself into  a boat, and crossing to the other side of the river, and then speeding  away on foot, reached Mr Swiveller's usual house of entertainment in  Bevis Marks, just as that gentleman sat down alone to dinner in its  dusky parlour.
    'Dick,' said the dwarf, thrusting his head in at the door, 'my pet, my  pupil, the apple of my eye, hey, hey!'    'Oh you're there, are you?' returned Mr Swiveller; 'how are you?'    'How's Dick?' retorted Quilp.
  'How's the cream of clerkship, eh?'    'Why, rather sour, sir,' replied Mr Swiveller.
  'Beginning to border  upon cheesiness, in fact.
'    'What's the matter?' said the dwarf, advancing.
  'Has Sally proved  unkind.
  "Of all the girls that are so smart, there's none like--" eh,  Dick!'    'Certainly not,' replied Mr Swiveller, eating his dinner with great  gravity, 'none like her.
  She's the sphynx of private life, is Sally B.
'    'You're out of spirits,' said Quilp, drawing up a chair.
  'What's the  matter?'    'The law don't agree with me,' returned Dick.
  'It isn't moist enough,  and there's too much confinement.
  I have been thinking of running  away.
'    'Bah!' said the dwarf.
  'Where would you run to, Dick?'    'I don't know' returned Mr Swiveller.
  'Towards Highgate, I suppose.
  Perhaps the bells might strike up "Turn again Swiveller, Lord Mayor of  London.
" Whittington's name was Dick.
  I wish cats were scarcer.
'    Quilp looked at his companion with his eyes screwed up into a comical  expression of curiosity, and patiently awaited his further explanation;  upon which, however, Mr Swiveller appeared in no hurry to enter, as he  ate a very long dinner in profound silence, finally pushed away his  plate, threw himself back into his chair, folded his arms, and stared  ruefully at the fire, in which some ends of cigars were smoking on  their own account, and sending up a fragrant odour.
    'Perhaps you'd like a bit of cake'--said Dick, at last turning to the  dwarf.
  'You're quite welcome to it.
  You ought to be, for it's of your  making.
'    'What do you mean?' said Quilp.
    Mr Swiveller replied by taking from his pocket a small and very greasy  parcel, slowly unfolding it, and displaying a little slab of plum-cake  extremely indigestible in appearance, and bordered with a paste of  white sugar an inch and a half deep.
    'What should you say this was?' demanded Mr Swiveller.
    'It looks like bride-cake,' replied the dwarf, grinning.
    'And whose should you say it was?' inquired Mr Swiveller, rubbing the  pastry against his nose with a dreadful calmness.
  'Whose?'    'Not--'    'Yes,' said Dick, 'the same.
  You needn't mention her name.
  There's no  such name now.
  Her name is Cheggs now, Sophy Cheggs.
  Yet loved I as  man never loved that hadn't wooden legs, and my heart, my heart is  breaking for the love of Sophy Cheggs.
'    With this extemporary adaptation of a popular ballad to the distressing  circumstances of his own case, Mr Swiveller folded up the parcel again,  beat it very flat between the palms of his hands, thrust it into his  breast, buttoned his coat over it, and folded his arms upon the whole.
    'Now, I hope you're satisfied, sir,' said Dick; 'and I hope Fred's  satisfied.
  You went partners in the mischief, and I hope you like it.
  This is the triumph I was to have, is it?  It's like the old  country-dance of that name, where there are two gentlemen to one lady,  and one has her, and the other hasn't, but comes limping up behind to  make out the figure.
  But it's Destiny, and mine's a crusher.
'    Disguising his secret joy in Mr Swiveller's defeat, Daniel Quilp  adopted the surest means of soothing him, by ringing the bell, and  ordering in a supply of rosy wine (that is to say, of its usual  representative), which he put about with great alacrity, calling upon  Mr Swiveller to pledge him in various toasts derisive of Cheggs, and  eulogistic of the happiness of single men.
  Such was their impression  on Mr Swiveller, coupled with the reflection that no man could oppose  his destiny, that in a very short space of time his spirits rose  surprisingly, and he was enabled to give the dwarf an account of the  receipt of the cake, which, it appeared, had been brought to Bevis  Marks by the two surviving Miss Wackleses in person, and delivered at  the office door with much giggling and joyfulness.
    'Ha!' said Quilp.
  'It will be our turn to giggle soon.
  And that  reminds me--you spoke of young Trent--where is he?'    Mr Swiveller explained that his respectable friend had recently  accepted a responsible situation in a locomotive gaming-house, and was  at that time absent on a professional tour among the adventurous  spirits of Great Britain.
    'That's unfortunate,' said the dwarf, 'for I came, in fact, to ask you  about him.
  A thought has occurred to me, Dick; your friend over the  way--'    'Which friend?'    'In the first floor.
'    'Yes?'    'Your friend in the first floor, Dick, may know him.
'    'No, he don't,' said Mr Swiveller, shaking his head.
    'Don't!  No, because he has never seen him,' rejoined Quilp; 'but if we  were to bring them together, who knows, Dick, but Fred, properly  introduced, would serve his turn almost as well as little Nell or her  grandfather--who knows but it might make the young fellow's fortune,  and, through him, yours, eh?'    'Why, the fact is, you see,' said Mr Swiveller, 'that they HAVE been  brought together.
'    'Have been!' cried the dwarf, looking suspiciously at his companion.
  'Through whose means?'    'Through mine,' said Dick, slightly confused.
 'Didn't I mention it to  you the last time you called over yonder?'    'You know you didn't,' returned the dwarf.
    'I believe you're right,' said Dick.
  'No.
  I didn't, I recollect.
  Oh  yes, I brought 'em together that very day.
  It was Fred's suggestion.
'    'And what came of it?'    'Why, instead of my friend's bursting into tears when he knew who Fred  was, embracing him kindly, and telling him that he was his grandfather,  or his grandmother in disguise (which we fully expected), he flew into  a tremendous passion; called him all manner of names; said it was in a  great measure his fault that little Nell and the old gentleman had ever  been brought to poverty; didn't hint at our taking anything to drink;  and--and in short rather turned us out of the room than otherwise.
'    'That's strange,' said the dwarf, musing.
    'So we remarked to each other at the time,' returned Dick coolly, 'but  quite true.
'    Quilp was plainly staggered by this intelligence, over which he brooded  for some time in moody silence, often raising his eyes to Mr  Swiveller's face, and sharply scanning its expression.
  As he could  read in it, however, no additional information or anything to lead him  to believe he had spoken falsely; and as Mr Swiveller, left to his own  meditations, sighed deeply, and was evidently growing maudlin on the  subject of Mrs Cheggs; the dwarf soon broke up the conference and took  his departure, leaving the bereaved one to his melancholy ruminations.
    'Have been brought together, eh?' said the dwarf as he walked the  streets alone.
  'My friend has stolen a march upon me.
  It led him to  nothing, and therefore is no great matter, save in the intention.
  I'm  glad he has lost his mistress.
  Ha ha!  The blockhead mustn't leave the  law at present.
  I'm sure of him where he is, whenever I want him for  my own purposes, and, besides, he's a good unconscious spy on Brass,  and tells, in his cups, all that he sees and hears.
  You're useful to  me, Dick, and cost nothing but a little treating now and then.
  I am  not sure that it may not be worth while, before long, to take credit  with the stranger, Dick, by discovering your designs upon the child;  but for the present we'll remain the best friends in the world, with  your good leave.
'    Pursuing these thoughts, and gasping as he went along, after his own  peculiar fashion, Mr Quilp once more crossed the Thames, and shut  himself up in his Bachelor's Hall, which, by reason of its  newly-erected chimney depositing the smoke inside the room and carrying  none of it off, was not quite so agreeable as more fastidious people  might have desired.
  Such inconveniences, however, instead of  disgusting the dwarf with his new abode, rather suited his humour; so,  after dining luxuriously from the public-house, he lighted his pipe,  and smoked against the chimney until nothing of him was visible through  the mist but a pair of red and highly inflamed eyes, with sometimes a  dim vision of his head and face, as, in a violent fit of coughing, he  slightly stirred the smoke and scattered the heavy wreaths by which  they were obscured.
  In the midst of this atmosphere, which must  infallibly have smothered any other man, Mr Quilp passed the evening  with great cheerfulness; solacing himself all the time with the pipe  and the case-bottle; and occasionally entertaining himself with a  melodious howl, intended for a song, but bearing not the faintest  resemblance to any scrap of any piece of music, vocal or instrumental,  ever invented by man.
  Thus he amused himself until nearly midnight,  when he turned into his hammock with the utmost satisfaction.
    The first sound that met his ears in the morning--as he half opened his  eyes, and, finding himself so unusually near the ceiling, entertained a  drowsy idea that he must have been transformed into a fly or  blue-bottle in the course of the night,--was that of a stifled sobbing  and weeping in the room.
  Peeping cautiously over the side of his  hammock, he descried Mrs Quilp, to whom, after contemplating her for  some time in silence, he communicated a violent start by suddenly  yelling out--'Halloa!'    'Oh, Quilp!' cried his poor little wife, looking up.
  'How you  frightened me!'    'I meant to, you jade,' returned the dwarf.
  'What do you want here?  I'm dead, an't I?'    'Oh, please come home, do come home,' said Mrs Quilp, sobbing; 'we'll  never do so any more, Quilp, and after all it was only a mistake that  grew out of our anxiety.
'    'Out of your anxiety,' grinned the dwarf.
  'Yes, I know that--out of  your anxiety for my death.
  I shall come home when I please, I tell  you.
  I shall come home when I please, and go when I please.
  I'll be a  Will o' the Wisp, now here, now there, dancing about you always,  starting up when you least expect me, and keeping you in a constant  state of restlessness and irritation.
  Will you begone?'    Mrs Quilp durst only make a gesture of entreaty.
    'I tell you no,' cried the dwarf.
  'No.
  If you dare to come here again  unless you're sent for, I'll keep watch-dogs in the yard that'll growl  and bite--I'll have man-traps, cunningly altered and improved for  catching women--I'll have spring guns, that shall explode when you  tread upon the wires, and blow you into little pieces.
  Will you  begone?'    'Do forgive me.
  Do come back,' said his wife, earnestly.
    'No-o-o-o-o!' roared Quilp.
  'Not till my own good time, and then I'll  return again as often as I choose, and be accountable to nobody for my  goings or comings.
  You see the door there.
  Will you go?'    Mr Quilp delivered this last command in such a very energetic voice,  and moreover accompanied it with such a sudden gesture, indicative of  an intention to spring out of his hammock, and, night-capped as he was,  bear his wife home again through the public streets, that she sped away  like an arrow.
  Her worthy lord stretched his neck and eyes until she  had crossed the yard, and then, not at all sorry to have had this  opportunity of carrying his point, and asserting the sanctity of his  castle, fell into an immoderate fit of laughter, and laid himself down  to sleep again.
              The bland and open-hearted proprietor of Bachelor's Hall slept on  amidst the congenial accompaniments of rain, mud, dirt, damp, fog, and  rats, until late in the day; when, summoning his valet Tom Scott to  assist him to rise, and to prepare breakfast, he quitted his couch, and  made his toilet.
  This duty performed, and his repast ended, he again  betook himself to Bevis Marks.
    This visit was not intended for Mr Swiveller, but for his friend and  employer Mr Sampson Brass.
  Both gentlemen however were from home, nor  was the life and light of law, Miss Sally, at her post either.
  The  fact of their joint desertion of the office was made known to all  comers by a scrap of paper in the hand-writing of Mr Swiveller, which  was attached to the bell-handle, and which, giving the reader no clue  to the time of day when it was first posted, furnished him with the  rather vague and unsatisfactory information that that gentleman would  'return in an hour.
'    'There's a servant, I suppose,' said the dwarf, knocking at the  house-door.
  'She'll do.
'    After a sufficiently long interval, the door was opened, and a small  voice immediately accosted him with, 'Oh please will you leave a card  or message?'    'Eh?' said the dwarf, looking down, (it was something quite new to him)  upon the small servant.
    To this, the child, conducting her conversation as upon the occasion of  her first interview with Mr Swiveller, again replied, 'Oh please will  you leave a card or message?'    'I'll write a note,' said the dwarf, pushing past her into the office;  'and mind your master has it directly he comes home.
'  So Mr Quilp  climbed up to the top of a tall stool to write the note, and the small  servant, carefully tutored for such emergencies, looked on with her  eyes wide open, ready, if he so much as abstracted a wafer, to rush  into the street and give the alarm to the police.
    As Mr Quilp folded his note (which was soon written: being a very short  one) he encountered the gaze of the small servant.
  He looked at her,  long and earnestly.
    'How are you?' said the dwarf, moistening a wafer with horrible  grimaces.
    The small servant, perhaps frightened by his looks, returned no audible  reply; but it appeared from the motion of her lips that she was  inwardly repeating the same form of expression concerning the note or  message.
    'Do they use you ill here?  is your mistress a Tartar?' said Quilp with  a chuckle.
    In reply to the last interrogation, the small servant, with a look of  infinite cunning mingled with fear, screwed up her mouth very tight and  round, and nodded violently.
  Whether there was anything in the  peculiar slyness of her action which fascinated Mr Quilp, or anything  in the expression of her features at the moment which attracted his  attention for some other reason; or whether it merely occurred to him  as a pleasant whim to stare the small servant out of countenance;  certain it is, that he planted his elbows square and firmly on the  desk, and squeezing up his cheeks with his hands, looked at her fixedly.
    'Where do you come from?' he said after a long pause, stroking his chin.
    'I don't know.
'    'What's your name?'    'Nothing.
'    'Nonsense!' retorted Quilp.
  'What does your mistress call you when she  wants you?'    'A little devil,' said the child.
    She added in the same breath, as if fearful of any further questioning,  'But please will you leave a card or message?'    These unusual answers might naturally have provoked some more  inquiries.
  Quilp, however, without uttering another word, withdrew his  eyes from the small servant, stroked his chin more thoughtfully than  before, and then, bending over the note as if to direct it with  scrupulous and hair-breadth nicety, looked at her, covertly but very  narrowly, from under his bushy eyebrows.
  The result of this secret  survey was, that he shaded his face with his hands, and laughed slyly  and noiselessly, until every vein in it was swollen almost to bursting.
  Pulling his hat over his brow to conceal his mirth and its effects, he  tossed the letter to the child, and hastily withdrew.
    Once in the street, moved by some secret impulse, he laughed, and held  his sides, and laughed again, and tried to peer through the dusty area  railings as if to catch another glimpse of the child, until he was  quite tired out.
  At last, he travelled back to the Wilderness, which  was within rifle-shot of his bachelor retreat, and ordered tea in the  wooden summer-house that afternoon for three persons; an invitation to  Miss Sally Brass and her brother to partake of that entertainment at  that place, having been the object both of his journey and his note.
    It was not precisely the kind of weather in which people usually take  tea in summer-houses, far less in summer-houses in an advanced state of  decay, and overlooking the slimy banks of a great river at low water.
  Nevertheless, it was in this choice retreat that Mr Quilp ordered a  cold collation to be prepared, and it was beneath its cracked and leaky  roof that he, in due course of time, received Mr Sampson and his sister  Sally.
    'You're fond of the beauties of nature,' said Quilp with a grin.
  'Is  this charming, Brass?  Is it unusual, unsophisticated, primitive?'    'It's delightful indeed, sir,' replied the lawyer.
    'Cool?' said Quilp.
    'N-not particularly so, I think, sir,' rejoined Brass, with his teeth  chattering in his head.
    'Perhaps a little damp and ague-ish?' said Quilp.
    'Just damp enough to be cheerful, sir,' rejoined Brass.
  'Nothing more,  sir, nothing more.
'    'And Sally?' said the delighted dwarf.
  'Does she like it?'    'She'll like it better,' returned that strong-minded lady, 'when she  has tea; so let us have it, and don't bother.
'    'Sweet Sally!' cried Quilp, extending his arms as if about to embrace  her.
  'Gentle, charming, overwhelming Sally.
'    'He's a very remarkable man indeed!' soliloquised Mr Brass.
  'He's  quite a Troubadour, you know; quite a Troubadour!'    These complimentary expressions were uttered in a somewhat absent and  distracted manner; for the unfortunate lawyer, besides having a bad  cold in his head, had got wet in coming, and would have willingly borne  some pecuniary sacrifice if he could have shifted his present raw  quarters to a warm room, and dried himself at a fire.
  Quilp,  however--who, beyond the gratification of his demon whims, owed Sampson  some acknowledgment of the part he had played in the mourning scene of  which he had been a hidden witness, marked these symptoms of uneasiness  with a delight past all expression, and derived from them a secret joy  which the costliest banquet could never have afforded him.
    It is worthy of remark, too, as illustrating a little feature in the  character of Miss Sally Brass, that, although on her own account she  would have borne the discomforts of the Wilderness with a very ill  grace, and would probably, indeed, have walked off before the tea  appeared, she no sooner beheld the latent uneasiness and misery of her  brother than she developed a grim satisfaction, and began to enjoy  herself after her own manner.
  Though the wet came stealing through the  roof and trickling down upon their heads, Miss Brass uttered no  complaint, but presided over the tea equipage with imperturbable  composure.
  While Mr Quilp, in his uproarious hospitality, seated  himself upon an empty beer-barrel, vaunted the place as the most  beautiful and comfortable in the three kingdoms, and elevating his  glass, drank to their next merry-meeting in that jovial spot; and Mr  Brass, with the rain plashing down into his tea-cup, made a dismal  attempt to pluck up his spirits and appear at his ease; and Tom Scott,  who was in waiting at the door under an old umbrella, exulted in his  agonies, and bade fair to split his sides with laughing; while all this  was passing, Miss Sally Brass, unmindful of the wet which dripped down  upon her own feminine person and fair apparel, sat placidly behind the  tea-board, erect and grizzly, contemplating the unhappiness of her  brother with a mind at ease, and content, in her amiable disregard of  self, to sit there all night, witnessing the torments which his  avaricious and grovelling nature compelled him to endure and forbade  him to resent.
  And this, it must be observed, or the illustration  would be incomplete, although in a business point of view she had the  strongest sympathy with Mr Sampson, and would have been beyond measure  indignant if he had thwarted their client in any one respect.
    In the height of his boisterous merriment, Mr Quilp, having on some  pretence dismissed his attendant sprite for the moment, resumed his  usual manner all at once, dismounted from his cask, and laid his hand  upon the lawyer's sleeve.
    'A word,' said the dwarf, 'before we go farther.
  Sally, hark'ee for a  minute.
'    Miss Sally drew closer, as if accustomed to business conferences with  their host which were the better for not having air.
    'Business,' said the dwarf, glancing from brother to sister.
  'Very  private business.
  Lay your heads together when you're by yourselves.
'    'Certainly, sir,' returned Brass, taking out his pocket-book and  pencil.
  'I'll take down the heads if you please, sir.
  Remarkable  documents,' added the lawyer, raising his eyes to the ceiling, 'most  remarkable documents.
  He states his points so clearly that it's a  treat to have 'em!  I don't know any act of parliament that's equal to  him in clearness.
'    'I shall deprive you of a treat,' said Quilp.
  'Put up your book.
  We  don't want any documents.
  So.
  There's a lad named Kit--'    Miss Sally nodded, implying that she knew of him.
    'Kit!' said Mr Sampson.
--'Kit!  Ha! I've heard the name before, but I  don't exactly call to mind--I don't exactly--'    'You're as slow as a tortoise, and more thick-headed than a  rhinoceros,' returned his obliging client with an impatient gesture.
    'He's extremely pleasant!' cried the obsequious Sampson.
  'His  acquaintance with Natural History too is surprising.
  Quite a Buffoon,  quite!'    There is no doubt that Mr Brass intended some compliment or other; and  it has been argued with show of reason that he would have said Buffon,  but made use of a superfluous vowel.
  Be this as it may, Quilp gave him  no time for correction, as he performed that office himself by more  than tapping him on the head with the handle of his umbrella.
    'Don't let's have any wrangling,' said Miss Sally, staying his hand.
  'I've showed you that I know him, and that's enough.
'    'She's always foremost!' said the dwarf, patting her on the back and  looking contemptuously at Sampson.
  'I don't like Kit, Sally.
'    'Nor I,' rejoined Miss Brass.
    'Nor I,' said Sampson.
    'Why, that's right!' cried Quilp.
  'Half our work is done already.
  This Kit is one of your honest people; one of your fair characters; a  prowling prying hound; a hypocrite; a double-faced, white-livered,  sneaking spy; a crouching cur to those that feed and coax him, and a  barking yelping dog to all besides.
'    'Fearfully eloquent!' cried Brass with a sneeze.
  'Quite appalling!'    'Come to the point,' said Miss Sally, 'and don't talk so much.
'    'Right again!' exclaimed Quilp, with another contemptuous look at  Sampson, 'always foremost!  I say, Sally, he is a yelping, insolent dog  to all besides, and most of all, to me.
  In short, I owe him a grudge.
'  'That's enough, sir,' said Sampson.
    'No, it's not enough, sir,' sneered Quilp; 'will you hear me out?  Besides that I owe him a grudge on that account, he thwarts me at this  minute, and stands between me and an end which might otherwise prove a  golden one to us all.
  Apart from that, I repeat that he crosses my  humour, and I hate him.
  Now, you know the lad, and can guess the rest.
  Devise your own means of putting him out of my way, and execute them.
  Shall it be done?'    'It shall, sir,' said Sampson.
    'Then give me your hand,' retorted Quilp.
  'Sally, girl, yours.
  I rely  as much, or more, on you than him.
  Tom Scott comes back.
  Lantern,  pipes, more grog, and a jolly night of it!'    No other word was spoken, no other look exchanged, which had the  slightest reference to this, the real occasion of their meeting.
  The  trio were well accustomed to act together, and were linked to each  other by ties of mutual interest and advantage, and nothing more was  needed.
  Resuming his boisterous manner with the same ease with which  he had thrown it off, Quilp was in an instant the same uproarious,  reckless little savage he had been a few seconds before.
  It was ten  o'clock at night before the amiable Sally supported her beloved and  loving brother from the Wilderness, by which time he needed the utmost  support her tender frame could render; his walk being from some unknown  reason anything but steady, and his legs constantly doubling up in  unexpected places.
    Overpowered, notwithstanding his late prolonged slumbers, by the  fatigues of the last few days, the dwarf lost no time in creeping to  his dainty house, and was soon dreaming in his hammock.
  Leaving him to  visions, in which perhaps the quiet figures we quitted in the old  church porch were not without their share, be it our task to rejoin  them as they sat and watched.
              After a long time, the schoolmaster appeared at the wicket-gate of the  churchyard, and hurried towards them, tingling in his hand, as he came  along, a bundle of rusty keys.
  He was quite breathless with pleasure  and haste when he reached the porch, and at first could only point  towards the old building which the child had been contemplating so  earnestly.
    'You see those two old houses,' he said at last.
    'Yes, surely,' replied Nell.
  'I have been looking at them nearly all  the time you have been away.
'    'And you would have looked at them more curiously yet, if you could  have guessed what I have to tell you,' said her friend.
  'One of those  houses is mine.
'    Without saying any more, or giving the child time to reply, the  schoolmaster took her hand, and, his honest face quite radiant with  exultation, led her to the place of which he spoke.
    They stopped before its low arched door.
  After trying several of the  keys in vain, the schoolmaster found one to fit the huge lock, which  turned back, creaking, and admitted them into the house.
    The room into which they entered was a vaulted chamber once nobly  ornamented by cunning architects, and still retaining, in its beautiful  groined roof and rich stone tracery, choice remnants of its ancient  splendour.
  Foliage carved in the stone, and emulating the mastery of  Nature's hand, yet remained to tell how many times the leaves outside  had come and gone, while it lived on unchanged.
  The broken figures  supporting the burden of the chimney-piece, though mutilated, were  still distinguishable for what they had been--far different from the  dust without--and showed sadly by the empty hearth, like creatures who  had outlived their kind, and mourned their own too slow decay.
    In some old time--for even change was old in that old place--a wooden  partition had been constructed in one part of the chamber to form a  sleeping-closet, into which the light was admitted at the same period  by a rude window, or rather niche, cut in the solid wall.
  This screen,  together with two seats in the broad chimney, had at some forgotten  date been part of the church or convent; for the oak, hastily  appropriated to its present purpose, had been little altered from its  former shape, and presented to the eye a pile of fragments of rich  carving from old monkish stalls.
    An open door leading to a small room or cell, dim with the light that  came through leaves of ivy, completed the interior of this portion of  the ruin.
  It was not quite destitute of furniture.
  A few strange  chairs, whose arms and legs looked as though they had dwindled away  with age; a table, the very spectre of its race: a great old chest that  had once held records in the church, with other quaintly-fashioned  domestic necessaries, and store of fire-wood for the winter, were  scattered around, and gave evident tokens of its occupation as a  dwelling-place at no very distant time.
    The child looked around her, with that solemn feeling with which we  contemplate the work of ages that have become but drops of water in the  great ocean of eternity.
  The old man had followed them, but they were  all three hushed for a space, and drew their breath softly, as if they  feared to break the silence even by so slight a sound.
    'It is a very beautiful place!' said the child, in a low voice.
    'I almost feared you thought otherwise,' returned the schoolmaster.
  'You shivered when we first came in, as if you felt it cold or gloomy.
'    'It was not that,' said Nell, glancing round with a slight shudder.
  'Indeed I cannot tell you what it was, but when I saw the outside, from  the church porch, the same feeling came over me.
  It is its being so  old and grey perhaps.
'    'A peaceful place to live in, don't you think so?' said her friend.
    'Oh yes,' rejoined the child, clasping her hands earnestly.
  'A quiet,  happy place--a place to live and learn to die in!' She would have said  more, but that the energy of her thoughts caused her voice to falter,  and come in trembling whispers from her lips.
      'A place to live, and learn to live, and gather health of mind and body  in,' said the schoolmaster; 'for this old house is yours.
'    'Ours!' cried the child.
    'Ay,' returned the schoolmaster gaily, 'for many a merry year to come,  I hope.
  I shall be a close neighbour--only next door--but this house  is yours.
'    Having now disburdened himself of his great surprise, the schoolmaster  sat down, and drawing Nell to his side, told her how he had learnt that  ancient tenement had been occupied for a very long time by an old  person, nearly a hundred years of age, who kept the keys of the church,  opened and closed it for the services, and showed it to strangers; how  she had died not many weeks ago, and nobody had yet been found to fill  the office; how, learning all this in an interview with the sexton, who  was confined to his bed by rheumatism, he had been bold to make mention  of his fellow-traveller, which had been so favourably received by that  high authority, that he had taken courage, acting on his advice, to  propound the matter to the clergyman.
  In a word, the result of his  exertions was, that Nell and her grandfather were to be carried before  the last-named gentleman next day; and, his approval of their conduct  and appearance reserved as a matter of form, that they were already  appointed to the vacant post.
    'There's a small allowance of money,' said the schoolmaster.
  'It is  not much, but still enough to live upon in this retired spot.
  By  clubbing our funds together, we shall do bravely; no fear of that.
'    'Heaven bless and prosper you!' sobbed the child.
    'Amen, my dear,' returned her friend cheerfully; 'and all of us, as it  will, and has, in leading us through sorrow and trouble to this  tranquil life.
  But we must look at MY house now.
  Come!'    They repaired to the other tenement; tried the rusty keys as before; at  length found the right one; and opened the worm-eaten door.
  It led  into a chamber, vaulted and old, like that from which they had come,  but not so spacious, and having only one other little room attached.
  It was not difficult to divine that the other house was of right the  schoolmaster's, and that he had chosen for himself the least  commodious, in his care and regard for them.
  Like the adjoining  habitation, it held such old articles of furniture as were absolutely  necessary, and had its stack of fire-wood.
    To make these dwellings as habitable and full of comfort as they could,  was now their pleasant care.
  In a short time, each had its cheerful  fire glowing and crackling on the hearth, and reddening the pale old  wall with a hale and healthy blush.
  Nell, busily plying her needle,  repaired the tattered window-hangings, drew together the rents that  time had worn in the threadbare scraps of carpet, and made them whole  and decent.
  The schoolmaster swept and smoothed the ground before the  door, trimmed the long grass, trained the ivy and creeping plants which  hung their drooping heads in melancholy neglect; and gave to the outer  walls a cheery air of home.
  The old man, sometimes by his side and  sometimes with the child, lent his aid to both, went here and there on  little patient services, and was happy.
  Neighbours, too, as they came  from work, proffered their help; or sent their children with such small  presents or loans as the strangers needed most.
  It was a busy day; and  night came on, and found them wondering that there was yet so much to  do, and that it should be dark so soon.
    They took their supper together, in the house which may be henceforth  called the child's; and, when they had finished their meal, drew round  the fire, and almost in whispers--their hearts were too quiet and glad  for loud expression--discussed their future plans.
  Before they  separated, the schoolmaster read some prayers aloud; and then, full of  gratitude and happiness, they parted for the night.
    At that silent hour, when her grandfather was sleeping peacefully in  his bed, and every sound was hushed, the child lingered before the  dying embers, and thought of her past fortunes as if they had been a  dream And she only now awoke.
  The glare of the sinking flame,  reflected in the oaken panels whose carved tops were dimly seen in the  dusky roof--the aged walls, where strange shadows came and went with  every flickering of the fire--the solemn presence, within, of that  decay which falls on senseless things the most enduring in their  nature: and, without, and round about on every side, of Death--filled  her with deep and thoughtful feelings, but with none of terror or  alarm.
  A change had been gradually stealing over her, in the time of  her loneliness and sorrow.
  With failing strength and heightening  resolution, there had sprung up a purified and altered mind; there had  grown in her bosom blessed thoughts and hopes, which are the portion of  few but the weak and drooping.
  There were none to see the frail,  perishable figure, as it glided from the fire and leaned pensively at  the open casement; none but the stars, to look into the upturned face  and read its history.
  The old church bell rang out the hour with a  mournful sound, as if it had grown sad from so much communing with the  dead and unheeded warning to the living; the fallen leaves rustled; the  grass stirred upon the graves; all else was still and sleeping.
    Some of those dreamless sleepers lay close within the shadow of the  church--touching the wall, as if they clung to it for comfort and  protection.
  Others had chosen to lie beneath the changing shade of  trees; others by the path, that footsteps might come near them; others,  among the graves of little children.
  Some had desired to rest beneath  the very ground they had trodden in their daily walks; some, where the  setting sun might shine upon their beds; some, where its light would  fall upon them when it rose.
  Perhaps not one of the imprisoned souls  had been able quite to separate itself in living thought from its old  companion.
  If any had, it had still felt for it a love like that which  captives have been known to bear towards the cell in which they have  been long confined, and, even at parting, hung upon its narrow bounds  affectionately.
    It was long before the child closed the window, and approached her bed.
  Again something of the same sensation as before--an involuntary  chill--a momentary feeling akin to fear--but vanishing directly, and  leaving no alarm behind.
  Again, too, dreams of the little scholar; of  the roof opening, and a column of bright faces, rising far away into  the sky, as she had seen in some old scriptural picture once, and  looking down on her, asleep.
  It was a sweet and happy dream.
  The  quiet spot, outside, seemed to remain the same, saving that there was  music in the air, and a sound of angels' wings.
  After a time the  sisters came there, hand in hand, and stood among the graves.
  And then  the dream grew dim, and faded.
    With the brightness and joy of morning, came the renewal of yesterday's  labours, the revival of its pleasant thoughts, the restoration of its  energies, cheerfulness, and hope.
  They worked gaily in ordering and  arranging their houses until noon, and then went to visit the clergyman.
    He was a simple-hearted old gentleman, of a shrinking, subdued spirit,  accustomed to retirement, and very little acquainted with the world,  which he had left many years before to come and settle in that place.
  His wife had died in the house in which he still lived, and he had long  since lost sight of any earthly cares or hopes beyond it.
    He received them very kindly, and at once showed an interest in Nell;  asking her name, and age, her birthplace, the circumstances which had  led her there, and so forth.
  The schoolmaster had already told her  story.
  They had no other friends or home to leave, he said, and had  come to share his fortunes.
  He loved the child as though she were his  own.
    'Well, well,' said the clergyman.
  'Let it be as you desire.
  She is  very young.
'    'Old in adversity and trial, sir,' replied the schoolmaster.
    'God help her.
  Let her rest, and forget them,' said the old gentleman.
  'But an old church is a dull and gloomy place for one so young as you,  my child.
'    'Oh no, sir,' returned Nell.
  'I have no such thoughts, indeed.
'    'I would rather see her dancing on the green at nights,' said the old  gentleman, laying his hand upon her head, and smiling sadly, 'than have  her sitting in the shadow of our mouldering arches.
  You must look to  this, and see that her heart does not grow heavy among these solemn  ruins.
  Your request is granted, friend.
'    After more kind words, they withdrew, and repaired to the child's  house; where they were yet in conversation on their happy fortune, when  another friend appeared.
    This was a little old gentleman, who lived in the parsonage-house, and  had resided there (so they learnt soon afterwards) ever since the death  of the clergyman's wife, which had happened fifteen years before.
  He  had been his college friend and always his close companion; in the  first shock of his grief he had come to console and comfort him; and  from that time they had never parted company.
  The little old gentleman  was the active spirit of the place, the adjuster of all differences,  the promoter of all merry-makings, the dispenser of his friend's  bounty, and of no small charity of his own besides; the universal  mediator, comforter, and friend.
  None of the simple villagers had  cared to ask his name, or, when they knew it, to store it in their  memory.
  Perhaps from some vague rumour of his college honours which  had been whispered abroad on his first arrival, perhaps because he was  an unmarried, unencumbered gentleman, he had been called the bachelor.
  The name pleased him, or suited him as well as any other, and the  Bachelor he had ever since remained.
  And the bachelor it was, it may  be added, who with his own hands had laid in the stock of fuel which  the wanderers had found in their new habitation.
    The bachelor, then--to call him by his usual appellation--lifted the  latch, showed his little round mild face for a moment at the door, and  stepped into the room like one who was no stranger to it.
    'You are Mr Marton, the new schoolmaster?' he said, greeting Nell's  kind friend.
    'I am, sir.
'    'You come well recommended, and I am glad to see you.
  I should have  been in the way yesterday, expecting you, but I rode across the country  to carry a message from a sick mother to her daughter in service some  miles off, and have but just now returned.
  This is our young  church-keeper?  You are not the less welcome, friend, for her sake, or  for this old man's; nor the worse teacher for having learnt humanity.
'  'She has been ill, sir, very lately,' said the schoolmaster, in answer  to the look with which their visitor regarded Nell when he had kissed  her cheek.
    'Yes, yes.
  I know she has,' he rejoined.
  'There have been suffering  and heartache here.
'    'Indeed there have, sir.
'    The little old gentleman glanced at the grandfather, and back again at  the child, whose hand he took tenderly in his, and held.
    'You will be happier here,' he said; 'we will try, at least, to make  you so.
  You have made great improvements here already.
  Are they the  work of your hands?'    'Yes, sir.
'    'We may make some others--not better in themselves, but with better  means perhaps,' said the bachelor.
  'Let us see now, let us see.
'    Nell accompanied him into the other little rooms, and over both the  houses, in which he found various small comforts wanting, which he  engaged to supply from a certain collection of odds and ends he had at  home, and which must have been a very miscellaneous and extensive one,  as it comprehended the most opposite articles imaginable.
  They all  came, however, and came without loss of time; for the little old  gentleman, disappearing for some five or ten minutes, presently  returned, laden with old shelves, rugs, blankets, and other household  gear, and followed by a boy bearing a similar load.
  These being cast  on the floor in a promiscuous heap, yielded a quantity of occupation in  arranging, erecting, and putting away; the superintendence of which  task evidently afforded the old gentleman extreme delight, and engaged  him for some time with great briskness and activity.
  When nothing more  was left to be done, he charged the boy to run off and bring his  schoolmates to be marshalled before their new master, and solemnly  reviewed.
    'As good a set of fellows, Marton, as you'd wish to see,' he said,  turning to the schoolmaster when the boy was gone; 'but I don't let 'em  know I think so.
  That wouldn't do, at all.
'    The messenger soon returned at the head of a long row of urchins, great  and small, who, being confronted by the bachelor at the house door,  fell into various convulsions of politeness; clutching their hats and  caps, squeezing them into the smallest possible dimensions, and making  all manner of bows and scrapes, which the little old gentleman  contemplated with excessive satisfaction, and expressed his approval of  by a great many nods and smiles.
  Indeed, his approbation of the boys  was by no means so scrupulously disguised as he had led the  schoolmaster to suppose, inasmuch as it broke out in sundry loud  whispers and confidential remarks which were perfectly audible to them  every one.
    'This first boy, schoolmaster,' said the bachelor, 'is John  Owen; a lad of good parts, sir, and frank, honest temper; but too  thoughtless, too playful, too light-headed by far.
  That boy, my good  sir, would break his neck with pleasure, and deprive his parents of  their chief comfort--and between ourselves, when you come to see him at  hare and hounds, taking the fence and ditch by the finger-post, and  sliding down the face of the little quarry, you'll never forget it.
  It's beautiful!'    John Owen having been thus rebuked, and being in perfect possession of  the speech aside, the bachelor singled out another boy.
    'Now, look at that lad, sir,' said the bachelor.
  'You see that fellow?  Richard Evans his name is, sir.
  An amazing boy to learn, blessed with  a good memory, and a ready understanding, and moreover with a good  voice and ear for psalm-singing, in which he is the best among us.
  Yet, sir, that boy will come to a bad end; he'll never die in his bed;  he's always falling asleep in sermon-time--and to tell you the truth,  Mr Marton, I always did the same at his age, and feel quite certain  that it was natural to my constitution and I couldn't help it.
'    This hopeful pupil edified by the above terrible reproval, the bachelor  turned to another.
    'But if we talk of examples to be shunned,' said he, 'if we come to  boys that should be a warning and a beacon to all their fellows, here's  the one, and I hope you won't spare him.
  This is the lad, sir; this  one with the blue eyes and light hair.
  This is a swimmer, sir, this  fellow--a diver, Lord save us!  This is a boy, sir, who had a fancy for  plunging into eighteen feet of water, with his clothes on, and bringing  up a blind man's dog, who was being drowned by the weight of his chain  and collar, while his master stood wringing his hands upon the bank,  bewailing the loss of his guide and friend.
  I sent the boy two guineas  anonymously, sir,' added the bachelor, in his peculiar whisper,  'directly I heard of it; but never mention it on any account, for he  hasn't the least idea that it came from me.
'    Having disposed of this culprit, the bachelor turned to another, and  from him to another, and so on through the whole array, laying, for  their wholesome restriction within due bounds, the same cutting  emphasis on such of their propensities as were dearest to his heart and  were unquestionably referrable to his own precept and example.
  Thoroughly persuaded, in the end, that he had made them miserable by  his severity, he dismissed them with a small present, and an admonition  to walk quietly home, without any leapings, scufflings, or turnings out  of the way; which injunction, he informed the schoolmaster in the same  audible confidence, he did not think he could have obeyed when he was a  boy, had his life depended on it.
    Hailing these little tokens of the bachelor's disposition as so many  assurances of his own welcome course from that time, the schoolmaster  parted from him with a light heart and joyous spirits, and deemed  himself one of the happiest men on earth.
  The windows of the two old  houses were ruddy again, that night, with the reflection of the  cheerful fires that burnt within; and the bachelor and his friend,  pausing to look upon them as they returned from their evening walk,  spoke softly together of the beautiful child, and looked round upon the  churchyard with a sigh.
              Nell was stirring early in the morning, and having discharged her  household tasks, and put everything in order for the good schoolmaster  (though sorely against his will, for he would have spared her the  pains), took down, from its nail by the fireside, a little bundle of  keys with which the bachelor had formally invested her on the previous  day, and went out alone to visit the old church.
    The sky was serene and bright, the air clear, perfumed with the fresh  scent of newly fallen leaves, and grateful to every sense.
  The  neighbouring stream sparkled, and rolled onward with a tuneful sound;  the dew glistened on the green mounds, like tears shed by Good Spirits  over the dead.
  Some young children sported among the tombs, and hid  from each other, with laughing faces.
  They had an infant with them,  and had laid it down asleep upon a child's grave, in a little bed of  leaves.
  It was a new grave--the resting-place, perhaps, of some little  creature, who, meek and patient in its illness, had often sat and  watched them, and now seemed, to their minds, scarcely changed.
    She drew near and asked one of them whose grave it was.
  The child  answered that that was not its name; it was a garden--his brother's.
  It was greener, he said, than all the other gardens, and the birds  loved it better because he had been used to feed them.
  When he had  done speaking, he looked at her with a smile, and kneeling down and  nestling for a moment with his cheek against the turf, bounded merrily  away.
    She passed the church, gazing upward at its old tower, went through the  wicket gate, and so into the village.
  The old sexton, leaning on a  crutch, was taking the air at his cottage door, and gave her good  morrow.
    'You are better?' said the child, stopping to speak with him.
    'Ay surely,' returned the old man.
  'I'm thankful to say, much better.
'    '_You_ will be quite well soon.
'    'With Heaven's leave, and a little patience.
  But come in, come in!'  The old man limped on before, and warning her of the downward step,  which he achieved himself with no small difficulty, led the way into  his little cottage.
    'It is but one room you see.
  There is another up above, but the stair  has got harder to climb o' late years, and I never use it.
  I'm  thinking of taking to it again, next summer, though.
'    The child wondered how a grey-headed man like him--one of his trade  too--could talk of time so easily.
  He saw her eyes wandering to the  tools that hung upon the wall, and smiled.
    'I warrant now,' he said, 'that you think all those are used in making  graves.
'    'Indeed, I wondered that you wanted so many.
'    'And well you might.
  I am a gardener.
  I dig the ground, and plant  things that are to live and grow.
  My works don't all moulder away, and  rot in the earth.
  You see that spade in the centre?'    'The very old one--so notched and worn?  Yes.
'    'That's the sexton's spade, and it's a well-used one, as you see.
  We're healthy people here, but it has done a power of work.
  If it  could speak now, that spade, it would tell you of many an unexpected  job that it and I have done together; but I forget 'em, for my memory's  a poor one.
--That's nothing new,' he added hastily.
  'It always was.
'    'There are flowers and shrubs to speak to your other work,' said the  child.
    'Oh yes.
  And tall trees.
  But they are not so separate from the  sexton's labours as you think.
'    'No!'    'Not in my mind, and recollection--such as it is,' said the old man.
  'Indeed they often help it.
  For say that I planted such a tree for  such a man.
  There it stands, to remind me that he died.
  When I look  at its broad shadow, and remember what it was in his time, it helps me  to the age of my other work, and I can tell you pretty nearly when I  made his grave.
'    'But it may remind you of one who is still alive,' said the child.
    'Of twenty that are dead, in connexion with that one who lives, then,'  rejoined the old man; 'wife, husband, parents, brothers, sisters,  children, friends--a score at least.
  So it happens that the sexton's  spade gets worn and battered.
  I shall need a new one--next summer.
'    The child looked quickly towards him, thinking that he jested with his  age and infirmity: but the unconscious sexton was quite in earnest.
    'Ah!' he said, after a brief silence.
  'People never learn.
  They never  learn.
  It's only we who turn up the ground, where nothing grows and  everything decays, who think of such things as these--who think of  them properly, I mean.
  You have been into the church?'    'I am going there now,' the child replied.
    'There's an old well there,' said the sexton, 'right underneath the  belfry; a deep, dark, echoing well.
  Forty year ago, you had only to  let down the bucket till the first knot in the rope was free of the  windlass, and you heard it splashing in the cold dull water.
  By little  and little the water fell away, so that in ten year after that, a  second knot was made, and you must unwind so much rope, or the bucket  swung tight and empty at the end.
  In ten years' time, the water fell  again, and a third knot was made.
  In ten years more, the well dried  up; and now, if you lower the bucket till your arms are tired, and let  out nearly all the cord, you'll hear it, of a sudden, clanking and  rattling on the ground below; with a sound of being so deep and so far  down, that your heart leaps into your mouth, and you start away as if  you were falling in.
'    'A dreadful place to come on in the dark!' exclaimed the child, who had  followed the old man's looks and words until she seemed to stand upon  its brink.
    'What is it but a grave!' said the sexton.
  'What else!  And which of  our old folks, knowing all this, thought, as the spring subsided, of  their own failing strength, and lessening life?  Not one!'    'Are you very old yourself?' asked the child, involuntarily.
    'I shall be seventy-nine--next summer.
'    'You still work when you are well?'    'Work!  To be sure.
  You shall see my gardens hereabout.
  Look at the  window there.
  I made, and have kept, that plot of ground entirely with  my own hands.
  By this time next year I shall hardly see the sky, the  boughs will have grown so thick.
  I have my winter work at night  besides.
'    He opened, as he spoke, a cupboard close to where he sat, and produced  some miniature boxes, carved in a homely manner and made of old wood.
    'Some gentlefolks who are fond of ancient days, and what belongs to  them,' he said, 'like to buy these keepsakes from our church and ruins.
  Sometimes, I make them of scraps of oak, that turn up here and there;  sometimes of bits of coffins which the vaults have long preserved.
  See  here--this is a little chest of the last kind, clasped at the edges  with fragments of brass plates that had writing on 'em once, though it  would be hard to read it now.
  I haven't many by me at this time of  year, but these shelves will be full--next summer.
'    The child admired and praised his work, and shortly afterwards  departed; thinking, as she went, how strange it was, that this old man,  drawing from his pursuits, and everything around him, one stern moral,  never contemplated its application to himself; and, while he dwelt upon  the uncertainty of human life, seemed both in word and deed to deem  himself immortal.
  But her musings did not stop here, for she was wise  enough to think that by a good and merciful adjustment this must be  human nature, and that the old sexton, with his plans for next summer,  was but a type of all mankind.
    Full of these meditations, she reached the church.
  It was easy to find  the key belonging to the outer door, for each was labelled on a scrap  of yellow parchment.
  Its very turning in the lock awoke a hollow  sound, and when she entered with a faltering step, the echoes that it  raised in closing, made her start.
    If the peace of the simple village had moved the child more strongly,  because of the dark and troubled ways that lay beyond, and through  which she had journeyed with such failing feet, what was the deep  impression of finding herself alone in that solemn building, where the  very light, coming through sunken windows, seemed old and grey, and the  air, redolent of earth and mould, seemed laden with decay, purified by  time of all its grosser particles, and sighing through arch and aisle,  and clustered pillars, like the breath of ages gone!  Here was the  broken pavement, worn, so long ago, by pious feet, that Time, stealing  on the pilgrims' steps, had trodden out their track, and left but  crumbling stones.
  Here were the rotten beam, the sinking arch, the  sapped and mouldering wall, the lowly trench of earth, the stately tomb  on which no epitaph remained--all--marble, stone, iron, wood, and  dust--one common monument of ruin.
  The best work and the worst, the  plainest and the richest, the stateliest and the least imposing--both  of Heaven's work and Man's--all found one common level here, and told  one common tale.
    Some part of the edifice had been a baronial chapel, and here were  effigies of warriors stretched upon their beds of stone with folded  hands--cross-legged, those who had fought in the Holy Wars--girded  with their swords, and cased in armour as they had lived.
  Some of  these knights had their own weapons, helmets, coats of mail, hanging  upon the walls hard by, and dangling from rusty hooks.
  Broken and  dilapidated as they were, they yet retained their ancient form, and  something of their ancient aspect.
  Thus violent deeds live after men  upon the earth, and traces of war and bloodshed will survive in  mournful shapes long after those who worked the desolation are but  atoms of earth themselves.
    The child sat down, in this old, silent place, among the stark figures  on the tombs--they made it more quiet there, than elsewhere, to her  fancy--and gazing round with a feeling of awe, tempered with a calm  delight, felt that now she was happy, and at rest.
  She took a Bible  from the shelf, and read; then, laying it down, thought of the summer  days and the bright springtime that would come--of the rays of sun that  would fall in aslant, upon the sleeping forms--of the leaves that would  flutter at the window, and play in glistening shadows on the  pavement--of the songs of birds, and growth of buds and blossoms out of  doors--of the sweet air, that would steal in, and gently wave the  tattered banners overhead.
  What if the spot awakened thoughts of  death!  Die who would, it would still remain the same; these sights and  sounds would still go on, as happily as ever.
  It would be no pain to  sleep amidst them.
    She left the chapel--very slowly and often turning back to gaze  again--and coming to a low door, which plainly led into the tower,  opened it, and climbed the winding stair in darkness; save where she  looked down, through narrow loopholes, on the place she had left, or  caught a glimmering vision of the dusty bells.
  At length she gained  the end of the ascent and stood upon the turret top.
    Oh! the glory of the sudden burst of light; the freshness of the fields  and woods, stretching away on every side, and meeting the bright blue  sky; the cattle grazing in the pasturage; the smoke, that, coming from  among the trees, seemed to rise upward from the green earth; the  children yet at their gambols down below--all, everything, so beautiful  and happy!  It was like passing from death to life; it was drawing  nearer Heaven.
    The children were gone, when she emerged into the porch, and locked the  door.
  As she passed the school-house she could hear the busy hum of  voices.
  Her friend had begun his labours only on that day.
  The noise  grew louder, and, looking back, she saw the boys come trooping out and  disperse themselves with merry shouts and play.
  'It's a good thing,'  thought the child, 'I am very glad they pass the church.
'  And then she  stopped, to fancy how the noise would sound inside, and how gently it  would seem to die away upon the ear.
    Again that day, yes, twice again, she stole back to the old chapel, and  in her former seat read from the same book, or indulged the same quiet  train of thought.
  Even when it had grown dusk, and the shadows of  coming night made it more solemn still, the child remained, like one  rooted to the spot, and had no fear or thought of stirring.
    They found her there, at last, and took her home.
  She looked pale but  very happy, until they separated for the night; and then, as the poor  schoolmaster stooped down to kiss her cheek, he thought he felt a tear  upon his face.
              The bachelor, among his various occupations, found in the old church a  constant source of interest and amusement.
  Taking that pride in it  which men conceive for the wonders of their own little world, he had  made its history his study; and many a summer day within its walls, and  many a winter's night beside the parsonage fire, had found the bachelor  still poring over, and adding to, his goodly store of tale and legend.
    As he was not one of those rough spirits who would strip fair Truth of  every little shadowy vestment in which time and teeming fancies love to  array her--and some of which become her pleasantly enough, serving,  like the waters of her well, to add new graces to the charms they half  conceal and half suggest, and to awaken interest and pursuit rather  than languor and indifference--as, unlike this stern and obdurate  class, he loved to see the goddess crowned with those garlands of wild  flowers which tradition wreathes for her gentle wearing, and which are  often freshest in their homeliest shapes--he trod with a light step and  bore with a light hand upon the dust of centuries, unwilling to  demolish any of the airy shrines that had been raised above it, if any  good feeling or affection of the human heart were hiding thereabouts.
  Thus, in the case of an ancient coffin of rough stone, supposed, for  many generations, to contain the bones of a certain baron, who, after  ravaging, with cut, and thrust, and plunder, in foreign lands, came  back with a penitent and sorrowing heart to die at home, but which had  been lately shown by learned antiquaries to be no such thing, as the  baron in question (so they contended) had died hard in battle, gnashing  his teeth and cursing with his latest breath--the bachelor stoutly  maintained that the old tale was the true one; that the baron,  repenting him of the evil, had done great charities and meekly given up  the ghost; and that, if ever baron went to heaven, that baron was then  at peace.
  In like manner, when the aforesaid antiquaries did argue and  contend that a certain secret vault was not the tomb of a grey-haired  lady who had been hanged and drawn and quartered by glorious Queen Bess  for succouring a wretched priest who fainted of thirst and hunger at  her door, the bachelor did solemnly maintain, against all comers, that  the church was hallowed by the said poor lady's ashes; that her remains  had been collected in the night from four of the city's gates, and  thither in secret brought, and there deposited; and the bachelor did  further (being highly excited at such times) deny the glory of Queen  Bess, and assert the immeasurably greater glory of the meanest woman in  her realm, who had a merciful and tender heart.
  As to the assertion  that the flat stone near the door was not the grave of the miser who  had disowned his only child and left a sum of money to the church to  buy a peal of bells, the bachelor did readily admit the same, and that  the place had given birth to no such man.
  In a word, he would have had  every stone, and plate of brass, the monument only of deeds whose  memory should survive.
  All others he was willing to forget.
  They  might be buried in consecrated ground, but he would have had them  buried deep, and never brought to light again.
    It was from the lips of such a tutor, that the child learnt her easy  task.
  Already impressed, beyond all telling, by the silent building  and the peaceful beauty of the spot in which it stood--majestic age  surrounded by perpetual youth--it seemed to her, when she heard these  things, sacred to all goodness and virtue.
  It was another world, where  sin and sorrow never came; a tranquil place of rest, where nothing evil  entered.
    When the bachelor had given her in connection with almost every tomb  and flat grave-stone some history of its own, he took her down into the  old crypt, now a mere dull vault, and showed her how it had been  lighted up in the time of the monks, and how, amid lamps depending from  the roof, and swinging censers exhaling scented odours, and habits  glittering with gold and silver, and pictures, and precious stuffs, and  jewels all flashing and glistening through the low arches, the chaunt  of aged voices had been many a time heard there, at midnight, in old  days, while hooded figures knelt and prayed around, and told their  rosaries of beads.
  Thence, he took her above ground again, and showed  her, high up in the old walls, small galleries, where the nuns had been  wont to glide along--dimly seen in their dark dresses so far off--or  to pause like gloomy shadows, listening to the prayers.
  He showed her  too, how the warriors, whose figures rested on the tombs, had worn  those rotting scraps of armour up above--how this had been a helmet,  and that a shield, and that a gauntlet--and how they had wielded the  great two-handed swords, and beaten men down, with yonder iron mace.
  All that he told the child she treasured in her mind; and sometimes,  when she awoke at night from dreams of those old times, and rising from  her bed looked out at the dark church, she almost hoped to see the  windows lighted up, and hear the organ's swell, and sound of voices, on  the rushing wind.
    The old sexton soon got better, and was about again.
  From him the  child learnt many other things, though of a different kind.
  He was not  able to work, but one day there was a grave to be made, and he came to  overlook the man who dug it.
  He was in a talkative mood; and the  child, at first standing by his side, and afterwards sitting on the  grass at his feet, with her thoughtful face raised towards his, began  to converse with him.
    Now, the man who did the sexton's duty was a little older than he,  though much more active.
  But he was deaf; and when the sexton (who  peradventure, on a pinch, might have walked a mile with great  difficulty in half-a-dozen hours) exchanged a remark with him about his  work, the child could not help noticing that he did so with an  impatient kind of pity for his infirmity, as if he were himself the  strongest and heartiest man alive.
    'I'm sorry to see there is this to do,' said the child when she  approached.
  'I heard of no one having died.
'    'She lived in another hamlet, my dear,' returned the sexton.
  'Three  mile away.
'    'Was she young?'    'Ye-yes' said the sexton; not more than sixty-four, I think.
  David,  was she more than sixty-four?'    David, who was digging hard, heard nothing of the question.
  The  sexton, as he could not reach to touch him with his crutch, and was too  infirm to rise without assistance, called his attention by throwing a  little mould upon his red nightcap.
    'What's the matter now?' said David, looking up.
    'How old was Becky Morgan?' asked the sexton.
    'Becky Morgan?' repeated David.
    'Yes,' replied the sexton; adding in a half compassionate, half  irritable tone, which the old man couldn't hear, 'you're getting very  deaf, Davy, very deaf to be sure!'    The old man stopped in his work, and cleansing his spade with a piece  of slate he had by him for the purpose--and scraping off, in the  process, the essence of Heaven knows how many Becky Morgans--set  himself to consider the subject.
    'Let me think' quoth he.
  'I saw last night what they had put upon the  coffin--was it seventy-nine?'    'No, no,' said the sexton.
    'Ah yes, it was though,' returned the old man with a sigh.
  'For I  remember thinking she was very near our age.
  Yes, it was seventy-nine.
'    'Are you sure you didn't mistake a figure, Davy?' asked the sexton,  with signs of some emotion.
    'What?' said the old man.
  'Say that again.
'    'He's very deaf.
  He's very deaf indeed,' cried the sexton petulantly;  'are you sure you're right about the figures?'    'Oh quite,' replied the old man.
  'Why not?'    'He's exceedingly deaf,' muttered the sexton to himself.
  'I think he's  getting foolish.
'    The child rather wondered what had led him to this belief, as, to say  the truth, the old man seemed quite as sharp as he, and was infinitely  more robust.
  As the sexton said nothing more just then, however, she  forgot it for the time, and spoke again.
    'You were telling me,' she said, 'about your gardening.
  Do you ever  plant things here?'    'In the churchyard?' returned the sexton, 'Not I.
'    'I have seen some flowers and little shrubs about,' the child rejoined;  'there are some over there, you see.
  I thought they were of your  rearing, though indeed they grow but poorly.
'    'They grow as Heaven wills,' said the old man; 'and it kindly ordains  that they shall never flourish here.
'    'I do not understand you.
'    'Why, this it is,' said the sexton.
  'They mark the graves of those who  had very tender, loving friends.
'    'I was sure they did!' the child exclaimed.
  'I am very glad to know  they do!'    'Aye,' returned the old man, 'but stay.
  Look at them.
  See how they  hang their heads, and droop, and wither.
  Do you guess the reason?'    'No,' the child replied.
    'Because the memory of those who lie below, passes away so soon.
  At  first they tend them, morning, noon, and night; they soon begin to come  less frequently; from once a day, to once a week; from once a week to  once a month; then, at long and uncertain intervals; then, not at all.
  Such tokens seldom flourish long.
  I have known the briefest summer  flowers outlive them.
'    'I grieve to hear it,' said the child.
    'Ah! so say the gentlefolks who come down here to look about them,'  returned the old man, shaking his head, 'but I say otherwise.
  "It's a  pretty custom you have in this part of the country," they say to me  sometimes, "to plant the graves, but it's melancholy to see these  things all withering or dead.
" I crave their pardon and tell them that,  as I take it, 'tis a good sign for the happiness of the living.
  And so  it is.
  It's nature.
'    'Perhaps the mourners learn to look to the blue sky by day, and to the  stars by night, and to think that the dead are there, and not in  graves,' said the child in an earnest voice.
    'Perhaps so,' replied the old man doubtfully.
  'It may be.
'    'Whether it be as I believe it is, or no,' thought the child within  herself, 'I'll make this place my garden.
  It will be no harm at least  to work here day by day, and pleasant thoughts will come of it, I am  sure.
'    Her glowing cheek and moistened eye passed unnoticed by the sexton, who  turned towards old David, and called him by his name.
  It was plain  that Becky Morgan's age still troubled him; though why, the child could  scarcely understand.
    The second or third repetition of his name attracted the old man's  attention.
  Pausing from his work, he leant on his spade, and put his  hand to his dull ear.
    'Did you call?' he said.
    'I have been thinking, Davy,' replied the sexton, 'that she,' he  pointed to the grave, 'must have been a deal older than you or me.
'    'Seventy-nine,' answered the old man with a shake of the head, 'I tell  you that I saw it.
'    'Saw it?' replied the sexton; 'aye, but, Davy, women don't always tell  the truth about their age.
'    'That's true indeed,' said the other old man, with a sudden sparkle in  his eye.
  'She might have been older.
'    'I'm sure she must have been.
  Why, only think how old she looked.
  You  and I seemed but boys to her.
'    'She did look old,' rejoined David.
  'You're right.
  She did look old.
'    'Call to mind how old she looked for many a long, long year, and say if  she could be but seventy-nine at last--only our age,' said the sexton.
    'Five year older at the very least!' cried the other.
    'Five!' retorted the sexton.
  'Ten.
  Good eighty-nine.
  I call to mind  the time her daughter died.
  She was eighty-nine if she was a day, and  tries to pass upon us now, for ten year younger.
  Oh!  human vanity!'    The other old man was not behindhand with some moral reflections on  this fruitful theme, and both adduced a mass of evidence, of such  weight as to render it doubtful--not whether the deceased was of the  age suggested, but whether she had not almost reached the patriarchal  term of a hundred.
  When they had settled this question to their mutual  satisfaction, the sexton, with his friend's assistance, rose to go.
    'It's chilly, sitting here, and I must be careful--till the summer,' he  said, as he prepared to limp away.
    'What?' asked old David.
    'He's very deaf, poor fellow!' cried the sexton.
  'Good-bye!'    'Ah!' said old David, looking after him.
  'He's failing very fast.
  He ages every day.
'    And so they parted; each persuaded that the other had less life in him  than himself; and both greatly consoled and comforted by the little  fiction they had agreed upon, respecting Becky Morgan, whose decease  was no longer a precedent of uncomfortable application, and would be no  business of theirs for half a score of years to come.
    The child remained, for some minutes, watching the deaf old man as he  threw out the earth with his shovel, and, often stopping to cough and  fetch his breath, still muttered to himself, with a kind of sober  chuckle, that the sexton was wearing fast.
  At length she turned away,  and walking thoughtfully through the churchyard, came unexpectedly upon  the schoolmaster, who was sitting on a green grave in the sun, reading.
    'Nell here?' he said cheerfully, as he closed his book.
  'It does me  good to see you in the air and light.
  I feared you were again in the  church, where you so often are.
'    'Feared!' replied the child, sitting down beside him.
  'Is it not a  good place?'    'Yes, yes,' said the schoolmaster.
  'But you must be gay  sometimes--nay, don't shake your head and smile so sadly.
'    'Not sadly, if you knew my heart.
  Do not look at me as if you thought  me sorrowful.
  There is not a happier creature on earth, than I am now.
'    Full of grateful tenderness, the child took his hand, and folded it  between her own.
  'It's God's will!' she said, when they had been  silent for some time.
    'What?'    'All this,' she rejoined; 'all this about us.
  But which of us is sad  now?  You see that I am smiling.
'    'And so am I,' said the schoolmaster; 'smiling to think how often we  shall laugh in this same place.
  Were you not talking yonder?'    'Yes,'the child rejoined.
    'Of something that has made you sorrowful?'    There was a long pause.
    'What was it?' said the schoolmaster, tenderly.
  'Come.
  Tell me what  it was.
'    'I rather grieve--I _do_ rather grieve to think,' said the child,  bursting into tears, 'that those who die about us, are so soon  forgotten.
'    'And do you think,' said the schoolmaster, marking the glance she had  thrown around, 'that an unvisited grave, a withered tree, a faded  flower or two, are tokens of forgetfulness or cold neglect?  Do you  think there are no deeds, far away from here, in which these dead may  be best remembered?  Nell, Nell, there may be people busy in the world,  at this instant, in whose good actions and good thoughts these very  graves--neglected as they look to us--are the chief instruments.
'    'Tell me no more,' said the child quickly.
  'Tell me no more.
  I feel,  I know it.
  How could I be unmindful of it, when I thought of you?'    'There is nothing,' cried her friend, 'no, nothing innocent or good,  that dies, and is forgotten.
  Let us hold to that faith, or none.
  An  infant, a prattling child, dying in its cradle, will live again in the  better thoughts of those who loved it, and will play its part, through  them, in the redeeming actions of the world, though its body be burnt  to ashes or drowned in the deepest sea.
  There is not an angel added to  the Host of Heaven but does its blessed work on earth in those that  loved it here.
  Forgotten! oh, if the good deeds of human creatures  could be traced to their source, how beautiful would even death appear;  for how much charity, mercy, and purified affection, would be seen to  have their growth in dusty graves!'    'Yes,' said the child, 'it is the truth; I know it is.
  Who should feel  its force so much as I, in whom your little scholar lives again!  Dear,  dear, good friend, if you knew the comfort you have given me!'    The poor schoolmaster made her no answer, but bent over her in silence;  for his heart was full.
    They were yet seated in the same place, when the grandfather  approached.
  Before they had spoken many words together, the church  clock struck the hour of school, and their friend withdrew.
    'A good man,' said the grandfather, looking after him; 'a kind man.
  Surely he will never harm us, Nell.
  We are safe here, at last, eh?  We  will never go away from here?'    The child shook her head and smiled.
    'She needs rest,' said the old man, patting her cheek; 'too pale--too  pale.
  She is not like what she was.
'    'When?' asked the child.
    'Ha!' said the old man, 'to be sure--when?  How many weeks ago?  Could  I count them on my fingers?  Let them rest though; they're better  gone.
'    'Much better, dear,' replied the child.
  'We will forget them;  or, if we ever call them to mind, it shall be only as some uneasy dream  that has passed away.
'    'Hush!' said the old man, motioning hastily to her with his hand and  looking over his shoulder; 'no more talk of the dream, and all the  miseries it brought.
  There are no dreams here.
  'Tis a quiet place,  and they keep away.
  Let us never think about them, lest they should  pursue us again.
  Sunken eyes and hollow cheeks--wet, cold, and  famine--and horrors before them all, that were even worse--we must  forget such things if we would be tranquil here.
'    'Thank Heaven!' inwardly exclaimed the child, 'for this most happy  change!'    'I will be patient,' said the old man, 'humble, very thankful, and  obedient, if you will let me stay.
  But do not hide from me; do not  steal away alone; let me keep beside you.
  Indeed, I will be very true  and faithful, Nell.
'    'I steal away alone! why that,' replied the child, with assumed gaiety,  'would be a pleasant jest indeed.
  See here, dear grandfather, we'll  make this place our garden--why not!  It is a very good one--and  to-morrow we'll begin, and work together, side by side.
'    'It is a brave thought!' cried her grandfather.
  'Mind, darling--we  begin to-morrow!'    Who so delighted as the old man, when they next day began their labour!  Who so unconscious of all associations connected with the spot, as he!  They plucked the long grass and nettles from the tombs, thinned the  poor shrubs and roots, made the turf smooth, and cleared it of the  leaves and weeds.
  They were yet in the ardour of their work, when the  child, raising her head from the ground over which she bent, observed  that the bachelor was sitting on the stile close by, watching them in  silence.
    'A kind office,' said the little gentleman, nodding to Nell as she  curtseyed to him.
  'Have you done all that, this morning?'    'It is very little, sir,' returned the child, with downcast eyes, 'to  what we mean to do.
'    'Good work, good work,' said the bachelor.
  'But do you only labour at  the graves of children, and young people?'    'We shall come to the others in good time, sir,' replied Nell, turning  her head aside, and speaking softly.
    It was a slight incident, and might have been design or accident, or  the child's unconscious sympathy with youth.
  But it seemed to strike  upon her grandfather, though he had not noticed it before.
  He looked  in a hurried manner at the graves, then anxiously at the child, then  pressed her to his side, and bade her stop to rest.
  Something he had  long forgotten, appeared to struggle faintly in his mind.
  It did not  pass away, as weightier things had done; but came uppermost again, and  yet again, and many times that day, and often afterwards.
  Once, while  they were yet at work, the child, seeing that he often turned and  looked uneasily at her, as though he were trying to resolve some  painful doubts or collect some scattered thoughts, urged him to tell  the reason.
  But he said it was nothing--nothing--and, laying her head  upon his arm, patted her fair cheek with his hand, and muttered that  she grew stronger every day, and would be a woman, soon.
              From that time, there sprung up in the old man's mind, a solicitude  about the child which never slept or left him.
  There are chords in the  human heart--strange, varying strings--which are only struck by  accident; which will remain mute and senseless to appeals the most  passionate and earnest, and respond at last to the slightest casual  touch.
  In the most insensible or childish minds, there is some train  of reflection which art can seldom lead, or skill assist, but which  will reveal itself, as great truths have done, by chance, and when the  discoverer has the plainest end in view.
  From that time, the old man  never, for a moment, forgot the weakness and devotion of the child;  from the time of that slight incident, he who had seen her toiling by  his side through so much difficulty and suffering, and had scarcely  thought of her otherwise than as the partner of miseries which he felt  severely in his own person, and deplored for his own sake at least as  much as hers, awoke to a sense of what he owed her, and what those  miseries had made her.
  Never, no, never once, in one unguarded moment  from that time to the end, did any care for himself, any thought of his  own comfort, any selfish consideration or regard distract his thoughts  from the gentle object of his love.
    He would follow her up and down, waiting till she should tire and lean  upon his arm--he would sit opposite to her in the chimney-corner,  content to watch, and look, until she raised her head and smiled upon  him as of old--he would discharge by stealth, those household duties  which tasked her powers too heavily--he would rise, in the cold dark  nights, to listen to her breathing in her sleep, and sometimes crouch  for hours by her bedside only to touch her hand.
  He who knows all, can  only know what hopes, and fears, and thoughts of deep affection, were  in that one disordered brain, and what a change had fallen on the poor  old man.
  Sometimes--weeks had crept on, then--the child, exhausted,  though with little fatigue, would pass whole evenings on a couch beside  the fire.
  At such times, the schoolmaster would bring in books, and  read to her aloud; and seldom an evening passed, but the bachelor came  in, and took his turn of reading.
  The old man sat and listened--with  little understanding for the words, but with his eyes fixed upon the  child--and if she smiled or brightened with the story, he would say it  was a good one, and conceive a fondness for the very book.
  When, in  their evening talk, the bachelor told some tale that pleased her (as  his tales were sure to do), the old man would painfully try to store it  in his mind; nay, when the bachelor left them, he would sometimes slip  out after him, and humbly beg that he would tell him such a part again,  that he might learn to win a smile from Nell.
    But these were rare occasions, happily; for the child yearned to be out  of doors, and walking in her solemn garden.
  Parties, too, would come  to see the church; and those who came, speaking to others of the child,  sent more; so even at that season of the year they had visitors almost  daily.
  The old man would follow them at a little distance through the  building, listening to the voice he loved so well; and when the  strangers left, and parted from Nell, he would mingle with them to  catch up fragments of their conversation; or he would stand for the  same purpose, with his grey head uncovered, at the gate as they passed  through.
    They always praised the child, her sense and beauty, and he was proud  to hear them!  But what was that, so often added, which wrung his  heart, and made him sob and weep alone, in some dull corner!  Alas!  even careless strangers--they who had no feeling for her, but the  interest of the moment--they who would go away and forget next week  that such a being lived--even they saw it--even they pitied her--even  they bade him good day compassionately, and whispered as they passed.
    The people of the village, too, of whom there was not one but grew to  have a fondness for poor Nell; even among them, there was the same  feeling; a tenderness towards her--a compassionate regard for her,  increasing every day.
  The very schoolboys, light-hearted and  thoughtless as they were, even they cared for her.
  The roughest among  them was sorry if he missed her in the usual place upon his way to  school, and would turn out of the path to ask for her at the latticed  window.
  If she were sitting in the church, they perhaps might peep in  softly at the open door; but they never spoke to her, unless she rose  and went to speak to them.
  Some feeling was abroad which raised the  child above them all.
    So, when Sunday came.
  They were all poor country people in the church,  for the castle in which the old family had lived, was an empty ruin,  and there were none but humble folks for seven miles around.
  There, as  elsewhere, they had an interest in Nell.
  They would gather round her  in the porch, before and after service; young children would cluster at  her skirts; and aged men and women forsake their gossips, to give her  kindly greeting.
  None of them, young or old, thought of passing the  child without a friendly word.
  Many who came from three or four miles  distant, brought her little presents; the humblest and rudest had good  wishes to bestow.
    She had sought out the young children whom she first saw playing in the  churchyard.
  One of these--he who had spoken of his brother--was her  little favourite and friend, and often sat by her side in the church,  or climbed with her to the tower-top.
  It was his delight to help her,  or to fancy that he did so, and they soon became close companions.
    It happened, that, as she was reading in the old spot by herself one  day, this child came running in with his eyes full of tears, and after  holding her from him, and looking at her eagerly for a moment, clasped  his little arms passionately about her neck.
    'What now?' said Nell, soothing him.
  'What is the matter?'    'She is not one yet!' cried the boy, embracing her still more closely.
  'No, no.
  Not yet.
'    She looked at him wonderingly, and putting his hair back from his face,  and kissing him, asked what he meant.
    'You must not be one, dear Nell,' cried the boy.
  'We can't see them.
  They never come to play with us, or talk to us.
  Be what you are.
  You  are better so.
'    'I do not understand you,' said the child.
  'Tell me what you mean.
'    'Why, they say,' replied the boy, looking up into her face, that you  will be an Angel, before the birds sing again.
  But you won't be, will  you?  Don't leave us Nell, though the sky is bright.
  Do not leave us!'    The child dropped her head, and put her hands before her face.
    'She cannot bear the thought!' cried the boy, exulting through his  tears.
  'You will not go.
  You know how sorry we should be.
  Dear Nell,  tell me that you'll stay amongst us.
  Oh!  Pray, pray, tell me that you  will.
'    The little creature folded his hands, and knelt down at her feet.
    'Only look at me, Nell,' said the boy, 'and tell me that you'll stop,  and then I shall know that they are wrong, and will cry no more.
  Won't  you say yes, Nell?'    Still the drooping head and hidden face, and the child quite  silent--save for her sobs.
    'After a time,' pursued the boy, trying to draw away her hand, 'the kind  angels will be glad to think that you are not among them, and that you  stayed here to be with us.
  Willy went away, to join them; but if he  had known how I should miss him in our little bed at night, he never  would have left me, I am sure.
'    Yet the child could make him no answer, and sobbed as though her heart  were bursting.
  'Why would you go, dear Nell?  I know you would not be  happy when you heard that we were crying for your loss.
  They say that  Willy is in Heaven now, and that it's always summer there, and yet I'm  sure he grieves when I lie down upon his garden bed, and he cannot turn  to kiss me.
  But if you do go, Nell,' said the boy, caressing her, and  pressing his face to hers, 'be fond of him for my sake.
  Tell him how I  love him still, and how much I loved you; and when I think that you two  are together, and are happy, I'll try to bear it, and never give you  pain by doing wrong--indeed I never will!'    The child suffered him to move her hands, and put them round his neck.
  There was a tearful silence, but it was not long before she looked upon  him with a smile, and promised him, in a very gentle, quiet voice, that  she would stay, and be his friend, as long as Heaven would let her.
  He  clapped his hands for joy, and thanked her many times; and being  charged to tell no person what had passed between them, gave her an  earnest promise that he never would.
    Nor did he, so far as the child could learn; but was her quiet  companion in all her walks and musings, and never again adverted to the  theme, which he felt had given her pain, although he was unconscious of  its cause.
  Something of distrust lingered about him still; for he  would often come, even in the dark evenings, and call in a timid voice  outside the door to know if she were safe within; and being answered  yes, and bade to enter, would take his station on a low stool at her  feet, and sit there patiently until they came to seek, and take him  home.
  Sure as the morning came, it found him lingering near the house  to ask if she were well; and, morning, noon, or night, go where she  would, he would forsake his playmates and his sports to bear her  company.
    'And a good little friend he is, too,' said the old sexton to her once.
  'When his elder brother died--elder seems a strange word, for he was  only seven years old--I remember this one took it sorely to heart.
'    The child thought of what the schoolmaster had told her, and felt how  its truth was shadowed out even in this infant.
    'It has given him something of a quiet way, I think,' said the old man,  'though for that he is merry enough at times.
  I'd wager now that you  and he have been listening by the old well.
'    'Indeed we have not,' the child replied.
  'I have been afraid to go  near it; for I am not often down in that part of the church, and do not  know the ground.
'    'Come down with me,' said the old man.
  'I have known it from a boy.
  Come!'    They descended the narrow steps which led into the crypt, and paused  among the gloomy arches, in a dim and murky spot.
    'This is the place,' said the old man.
  'Give me your hand while you  throw back the cover, lest you should stumble and fall in.
  I am too  old--I mean rheumatic--to stoop, myself.
'    'A black and dreadful place!' exclaimed the child.
    'Look in,' said the old man, pointing downward with his finger.
    The child complied, and gazed down into the pit.
    'It looks like a grave itself,' said the old man.
    'It does,' replied the child.
    'I have often had the fancy,' said the sexton, 'that it might have been  dug at first to make the old place more gloomy, and the old monks more  religious.
  It's to be closed up, and built over.
'    The child still stood, looking thoughtfully into the vault.
    'We shall see,' said the sexton, 'on what gay heads other earth will  have closed, when the light is shut out from here.
  God knows!  They'll  close it up, next spring.
'    'The birds sing again in spring,' thought the child, as she leaned at  her casement window, and gazed at the declining sun.
  'Spring! a  beautiful and happy time!'              A day or two after the Quilp tea-party at the Wilderness, Mr Swiveller  walked into Sampson Brass's office at the usual hour, and being alone  in that Temple of Probity, placed his hat upon the desk, and taking  from his pocket a small parcel of black crape, applied himself to  folding and pinning the same upon it, after the manner of a hatband.
  Having completed the construction of this appendage, he surveyed his  work with great complacency, and put his hat on again--very much over  one eye, to increase the mournfulness of the effect.
  These  arrangements perfected to his entire satisfaction, he thrust his hands  into his pockets, and walked up and down the office with measured steps.
    'It has always been the same with me,' said Mr Swiveller, 'always.
  'Twas ever thus--from childhood's hour I've seen my fondest hopes  decay, I never loved a tree or flower but 'twas the first to fade away;  I never nursed a dear Gazelle, to glad me with its soft black eye, but  when it came to know me well, and love me, it was sure to marry a  market-gardener.
'    Overpowered by these reflections, Mr Swiveller stopped short at the  clients' chair, and flung himself into its open arms.
    'And this,' said Mr Swiveller, with a kind of bantering composure, 'is  life, I believe.
  Oh, certainly.
  Why not!  I'm quite satisfied.
  I  shall wear,' added Richard, taking off his hat again and looking hard  at it, as if he were only deterred by pecuniary considerations from  spurning it with his foot, 'I shall wear this emblem of woman's  perfidy, in remembrance of her with whom I shall never again thread the  windings of the mazy; whom I shall never more pledge in the rosy; who,  during the short remainder of my existence, will murder the balmy.
  Ha,  ha, ha!'    It may be necessary to observe, lest there should appear any  incongruity in the close of this soliloquy, that Mr Swiveller did not  wind up with a cheerful hilarious laugh, which would have been  undoubtedly at variance with his solemn reflections, but that, being in  a theatrical mood, he merely achieved that performance which is  designated in melodramas 'laughing like a fiend,'--for it seems that  your fiends always laugh in syllables, and always in three syllables,  never more nor less, which is a remarkable property in such gentry, and  one worthy of remembrance.
    The baleful sounds had hardly died away, and Mr Swiveller was still  sitting in a very grim state in the clients' chair, when there came a  ring--or, if we may adapt the sound to his then humour, a knell--at  the office bell.
  Opening the door with all speed, he beheld the  expressive countenance of Mr Chuckster, between whom and himself a  fraternal greeting ensued.
    'You're devilish early at this pestiferous old slaughter-house,' said  that gentleman, poising himself on one leg, and shaking the other in an  easy manner.
    'Rather,' returned Dick.
    'Rather!' retorted Mr Chuckster, with that air of graceful trifling  which so well became him.
  'I should think so.
  Why, my good feller, do  you know what o'clock it is--half-past nine a.
m.
 in the morning?'    'Won't you come in?' said Dick.
  'All alone.
  Swiveller solus.
  "'Tis  now the witching--"'    '"Hour of night!"'    '"When churchyards yawn,"'    '"And graves give up their dead.
"'    At the end of this quotation in dialogue, each gentleman struck an  attitude, and immediately subsiding into prose walked into the office.
  Such morsels of enthusiasm are common among the Glorious Apollos, and  were indeed the links that bound them together, and raised them above  the cold dull earth.
    'Well, and how are you my buck?' said Mr Chuckster, taking a stool.
  'I  was forced to come into the City upon some little private matters of my  own, and couldn't pass the corner of the street without looking in, but  upon my soul I didn't expect to find you.
  It is so everlastingly  early.
'    Mr Swiveller expressed his acknowledgments; and it appearing on further  conversation that he was in good health, and that Mr Chuckster was in  the like enviable condition, both gentlemen, in compliance with a  solemn custom of the ancient Brotherhood to which they belonged, joined  in a fragment of the popular duet of 'All's Well,' with a long shake  at the end.
    'And what's the news?' said Richard.
    'The town's as flat, my dear feller,' replied Mr Chuckster, 'as the  surface of a Dutch oven.
  There's no news.
  By-the-bye, that lodger of  yours is a most extraordinary person.
  He quite eludes the most  vigorous comprehension, you know.
  Never was such a feller!'    'What has he been doing now?' said Dick.
    'By Jove, Sir,' returned Mr Chuckster, taking out an oblong snuff-box,  the lid whereof was ornamented with a fox's head curiously carved in  brass, 'that man is an unfathomable.
  Sir, that man has made friends  with our articled clerk.
  There's no harm in him, but he is so  amazingly slow and soft.
  Now, if he wanted a friend, why couldn't he  have one that knew a thing or two, and could do him some good by his  manners and conversation.
  I have my faults, sir,' said Mr Chuckster--    'No, no,' interposed Mr Swiveller.
    'Oh yes I have, I have my faults, no man knows his faults better than I  know mine.
  But,' said Mr Chuckster, 'I'm not meek.
  My worst  enemies--every man has his enemies, Sir, and I have mine--never  accused me of being meek.
  And I tell you what, Sir, if I hadn't more  of these qualities that commonly endear man to man, than our articled  clerk has, I'd steal a Cheshire cheese, tie it round my neck, and drown  myself.
  I'd die degraded, as I had lived.
  I would upon my honour.
'    Mr Chuckster paused, rapped the fox's head exactly on the nose with the  knuckle of the fore-finger, took a pinch of snuff, and looked steadily  at Mr Swiveller, as much as to say that if he thought he was going to  sneeze, he would find himself mistaken.
    'Not contented, Sir,' said Mr Chuckster, 'with making friends with  Abel, he has cultivated the acquaintance of his father and mother.
  Since he came home from that wild-goose chase, he has been there--  actually been there.
  He patronises young Snobby besides; you'll find,  Sir, that he'll be constantly coming backwards and forwards to this  place: yet I don't suppose that beyond the common forms of civility, he  has ever exchanged half-a-dozen words with me.
  Now, upon my soul, you  know,' said Mr Chuckster, shaking his head gravely, as men are wont to  do when they consider things are going a little too far, 'this is  altogether such a low-minded affair, that if I didn't feel for the  governor, and know that he could never get on without me, I should be  obliged to cut the connection.
  I should have no alternative.
'    Mr Swiveller, who sat on another stool opposite to his friend, stirred  the fire in an excess of sympathy, but said nothing.
    'As to young Snob, sir,' pursued Mr Chuckster with a prophetic look,  'you'll find he'll turn out bad.
  In our profession we know something  of human nature, and take my word for it, that the feller that came  back to work out that shilling, will show himself one of these days in  his true colours.
  He's a low thief, sir.
  He must be.
'    Mr Chuckster being roused, would probably have pursued this subject  further, and in more emphatic language, but for a tap at the door,  which seeming to announce the arrival of somebody on business, caused  him to assume a greater appearance of meekness than was perhaps quite  consistent with his late declaration.
  Mr Swiveller, hearing the same  sound, caused his stool to revolve rapidly on one leg until it brought  him to his desk, into which, having forgotten in the sudden flurry of  his spirits to part with the poker, he thrust it as he cried 'Come in!'    Who should present himself but that very Kit who had been the theme of  Mr Chuckster's wrath!  Never did man pluck up his courage so quickly,  or look so fierce, as Mr Chuckster when he found it was he.
  Mr  Swiveller stared at him for a moment, and then leaping from his stool,  and drawing out the poker from its place of concealment, performed the  broad-sword exercise with all the cuts and guards complete, in a  species of frenzy.
    'Is the gentleman at home?' said Kit, rather astonished by this  uncommon reception.
    Before Mr Swiveller could make any reply, Mr Chuckster took occasion to  enter his indignant protest against this form of inquiry; which he held  to be of a disrespectful and snobbish tendency, inasmuch as the  inquirer, seeing two gentlemen then and there present, should have  spoken of the other gentleman; or rather (for it was not impossible  that the object of his search might be of inferior quality) should have  mentioned his name, leaving it to his hearers to determine his degree  as they thought proper.
  Mr Chuckster likewise remarked, that he had  some reason to believe this form of address was personal to himself,  and that he was not a man to be trifled with--as certain snobs (whom he  did not more particularly mention or describe) might find to their cost.
    'I mean the gentleman up-stairs,' said Kit, turning to Richard  Swiveller.
  'Is he at home?'    'Why?' rejoined Dick.
    'Because if he is, I have a letter for him.
'    'From whom?' said Dick.
    'From Mr Garland.
'    'Oh!' said Dick, with extreme politeness.
  'Then you may hand it over,  Sir.
  And if you're to wait for an answer, Sir, you may wait in the  passage, Sir, which is an airy and well-ventilated apartment, sir.
'    'Thank you,' returned Kit.
  'But I am to give it to himself, if you  please.
'    The excessive audacity of this retort so overpowered Mr Chuckster, and  so moved his tender regard for his friend's honour, that he declared,  if he were not restrained by official considerations, he must certainly  have annihilated Kit upon the spot; a resentment of the affront which  he did consider, under the extraordinary circumstances of aggravation  attending it, could but have met with the proper sanction and approval  of a jury of Englishmen, who, he had no doubt, would have returned a  verdict of justifiable Homicide, coupled with a high testimony to the  morals and character of the Avenger.
  Mr Swiveller, without being quite  so hot upon the matter, was rather shamed by his friend's excitement,  and not a little puzzled how to act (Kit being quite cool and  good-humoured), when the single gentleman was heard to call violently  down the stairs.
    'Didn't I see somebody for me, come in?' cried the lodger.
    'Yes, Sir,' replied Dick.
  'Certainly, Sir.
'    'Then where is he?' roared the single gentleman.
    'He's here, sir,' rejoined Mr Swiveller.
  'Now young man, don't you  hear you're to go up-stairs?  Are you deaf?'    Kit did not appear to think it worth his while to enter into any  altercation, but hurried off and left the Glorious Apollos gazing at  each other in silence.
    'Didn't I tell you so?' said Mr Chuckster.
  'What do you think of that?'    Mr Swiveller being in the main a good-natured fellow, and not  perceiving in the conduct of Kit any villany of enormous magnitude,  scarcely knew what answer to return.
  He was relieved from his  perplexity, however, by the entrance of Mr Sampson and his sister,  Sally, at sight of whom Mr Chuckster precipitately retired.
    Mr Brass and his lovely companion appeared to have been holding a  consultation over their temperate breakfast, upon some matter of great  interest and importance.
  On the occasion of such conferences, they  generally appeared in the office some half an hour after their usual  time, and in a very smiling state, as though their late plots and  designs had tranquillised their minds and shed a light upon their  toilsome way.
  In the present instance, they seemed particularly gay;  Miss Sally's aspect being of a most oily kind, and Mr Brass rubbing his  hands in an exceedingly jocose and light-hearted manner.
    'Well, Mr Richard,' said Brass.
  'How are we this morning?  Are we  pretty fresh and cheerful sir--eh, Mr Richard?'    'Pretty well, sir,' replied Dick.
    'That's well,' said Brass.
  'Ha ha!  We should be as gay as larks, Mr  Richard--why not?  It's a pleasant world we live in sir, a very  pleasant world.
  There are bad people in it, Mr Richard, but if there  were no bad people, there would be no good lawyers.
  Ha ha!  Any  letters by the post this morning, Mr Richard?'    Mr Swiveller answered in the negative.
    'Ha!' said Brass, 'no matter.
  If there's little business to-day,  there'll be more to-morrow.
  A contented spirit, Mr Richard, is the  sweetness of existence.
  Anybody been here, sir?'    'Only my friend'--replied Dick.
  'May we ne'er want a--'    'Friend,' Brass chimed in quickly, 'or a bottle to give him.
  Ha ha!  That's the way the song runs, isn't it?  A very good song, Mr Richard,  very good.
  I like the sentiment of it.
  Ha ha!  Your friend's the  young man from Witherden's office I think--yes--May we ne'er want a--  Nobody else at all, been, Mr Richard?'    'Only somebody to the lodger,' replied Mr Swiveller.
    'Oh indeed!' cried Brass.
  'Somebody to the lodger eh?  Ha ha!  May we  ne'er want a friend, or a----  Somebody to the lodger, eh, Mr Richard?'    'Yes,' said Dick, a little disconcerted by the excessive buoyancy of  spirits which his employer displayed.
  'With him now.
'    'With him now!' cried Brass; 'Ha ha!  There let 'em be, merry and free,  toor rul lol le.
  Eh, Mr Richard?  Ha ha!'    'Oh certainly,' replied Dick.
    'And who,' said Brass, shuffling among his papers, 'who is the lodger's  visitor--not a lady visitor, I hope, eh, Mr Richard?  The morals of the  Marks you know, sir--"when lovely women stoops to folly"--and all  that--eh, Mr Richard?'    'Another young man, who belongs to Witherden's too, or half belongs  there,' returned Richard.
  'Kit, they call him.
'    'Kit, eh!' said Brass.
  'Strange name--name of a dancing-master's  fiddle, eh, Mr Richard?  Ha ha!  Kit's there, is he?  Oh!'    Dick looked at Miss Sally, wondering that she didn't check this  uncommon exuberance on the part of Mr Sampson; but as she made no  attempt to do so, and rather appeared to exhibit a tacit acquiescence  in it, he concluded that they had just been cheating somebody, and  receiving the bill.
    'Will you have the goodness, Mr Richard,' said Brass, taking a letter  from his desk, 'just to step over to Peckham Rye with that?  There's no  answer, but it's rather particular and should go by hand.
  Charge the  office with your coach-hire back, you know; don't spare the office; get  as much out of it as you can--clerk's motto--Eh, Mr Richard?  Ha ha!'    Mr Swiveller solemnly doffed the aquatic jacket, put on his coat, took  down his hat from its peg, pocketed the letter, and departed.
  As soon  as he was gone, up rose Miss Sally Brass, and smiling sweetly at her  brother (who nodded and smote his nose in return) withdrew also.
    Sampson Brass was no sooner left alone, than he set the office-door  wide open, and establishing himself at his desk directly opposite, so  that he could not fail to see anybody who came down-stairs and passed  out at the street door, began to write with extreme cheerfulness and  assiduity; humming as he did so, in a voice that was anything but  musical, certain vocal snatches which appeared to have reference to the  union between Church and State, inasmuch as they were compounded of the  Evening Hymn and God save the King.
    Thus, the attorney of Bevis Marks sat, and wrote, and hummed, for a  long time, except when he stopped to listen with a very cunning face,  and hearing nothing, went on humming louder, and writing slower than  ever.
  At length, in one of these pauses, he heard his lodger's door  opened and shut, and footsteps coming down the stairs.
  Then, Mr Brass  left off writing entirely, and, with his pen in his hand, hummed his  very loudest; shaking his head meanwhile from side to side, like a man  whose whole soul was in the music, and smiling in a manner quite  seraphic.
    It was towards this moving spectacle that the staircase and the sweet  sounds guided Kit; on whose arrival before his door, Mr Brass stopped  his singing, but not his smiling, and nodded affably: at the same time  beckoning to him with his pen.
    'Kit,' said Mr Brass, in the pleasantest way imaginable, 'how do you  do?'    Kit, being rather shy of his friend, made a suitable reply, and had his  hand upon the lock of the street door when Mr Brass called him softly  back.
    'You are not to go, if you please, Kit,' said the attorney in a  mysterious and yet business-like way.
  'You are to step in here, if you  please.
  Dear me, dear me!  When I look at you,' said the lawyer,  quitting his stool, and standing before the fire with his back towards  it, 'I am reminded of the sweetest little face that ever my eyes  beheld.
  I remember your coming there, twice or thrice, when we were in  possession.
  Ah Kit, my dear fellow, gentleman in my profession have  such painful duties to perform sometimes, that you needn't envy us--you  needn't indeed!'    'I don't, sir,' said Kit, 'though it isn't for the like of me to judge.
'    'Our only consolation, Kit,' pursued the lawyer, looking at him in a  sort of pensive abstraction, 'is, that although we cannot turn away the  wind, we can soften it; we can temper it, if I may say so, to the shorn  lambs.
'    'Shorn indeed!' thought Kit.
  'Pretty close!' But he didn't say _so_.
    'On that occasion, Kit,' said Mr Brass, 'on that occasion that I have  just alluded to, I had a hard battle with Mr Quilp (for Mr Quilp is a  very hard man) to obtain them the indulgence they had.
  It might have  cost me a client.
  But suffering virtue inspired me, and I prevailed.
'    'He's not so bad after all,' thought honest Kit, as the attorney pursed  up his lips and looked like a man who was struggling with his better  feelings.
    'I respect you, Kit,' said Brass with emotion.
  'I saw enough of your  conduct, at that time, to respect you, though your station is humble,  and your fortune lowly.
  It isn't the waistcoat that I look at.
  It is  the heart.
  The checks in the waistcoat are but the wires of the cage.
  But the heart is the bird.
  Ah!  How many sich birds are perpetually  moulting, and putting their beaks through the wires to peck at all  mankind!'    This poetic figure, which Kit took to be in a special allusion to his  own checked waistcoat, quite overcame him; Mr Brass's voice and manner  added not a little to its effect, for he discoursed with all the mild  austerity of a hermit, and wanted but a cord round the waist of his  rusty surtout, and a skull on the chimney-piece, to be completely set  up in that line of business.
    'Well, well,' said Sampson, smiling as good men smile when they  compassionate their own weakness or that of their fellow-creatures,  'this is wide of the bull's-eye.
  You're to take that, if you please.
'  As he spoke, he pointed to a couple of half-crowns on the desk.
    Kit looked at the coins, and then at Sampson, and hesitated.
    'For yourself,' said Brass.
  'From--'    'No matter about the person they came from,' replied the lawyer.
  'Say  me, if you like.
  We have eccentric friends overhead, Kit, and we  mustn't ask questions or talk too much--you understand?  You're to take  them, that's all; and between you and me, I don't think they'll be the  last you'll have to take from the same place.
  I hope not.
  Good bye,  Kit.
  Good bye!'    With many thanks, and many more self-reproaches for having on such  slight grounds suspected one who in their very first conversation  turned out such a different man from what he had supposed, Kit took the  money and made the best of his way home.
  Mr Brass remained airing  himself at the fire, and resumed his vocal exercise, and his seraphic  smile, simultaneously.
    'May I come in?' said Miss Sally, peeping.
    'Oh yes, you may come in,' returned her brother.
    'Ahem!' coughed Miss Brass interrogatively.
    'Why, yes,' returned Sampson, 'I should say as good as done.
'              Mr Chuckster's indignant apprehensions were not without foundation.
  Certainly the friendship between the single gentleman and Mr Garland  was not suffered to cool, but had a rapid growth and flourished  exceedingly.
  They were soon in habits of constant intercourse and  communication; and the single gentleman labouring at this time under a  slight attack of illness--the consequence most probably of his late  excited feelings and subsequent disappointment--furnished a reason for  their holding yet more frequent correspondence; so that some one of the  inmates of Abel Cottage, Finchley, came backwards and forwards between  that place and Bevis Marks, almost every day.
    As the pony had now thrown off all disguise, and without any mincing of  the matter or beating about the bush, sturdily refused to be driven by  anybody but Kit, it generally happened that whether old Mr Garland  came, or Mr Abel, Kit was of the party.
  Of all messages and inquiries,  Kit was, in right of his position, the bearer; thus it came about that,  while the single gentleman remained indisposed, Kit turned into Bevis  Marks every morning with nearly as much regularity as the General  Postman.
    Mr Sampson Brass, who no doubt had his reasons for looking sharply  about him, soon learnt to distinguish the pony's trot and the clatter  of the little chaise at the corner of the street.
  Whenever the sound  reached his ears, he would immediately lay down his pen and fall to  rubbing his hands and exhibiting the greatest glee.
    'Ha ha!' he would cry.
  'Here's the pony again!  Most remarkable pony,  extremely docile, eh, Mr Richard, eh sir?'    Dick would return some matter-of-course reply, and Mr Brass standing on  the bottom rail of his stool, so as to get a view of the street over  the top of the window-blind, would take an observation of the visitors.
    'The old gentleman again!' he would exclaim, 'a very prepossessing old  gentleman, Mr Richard--charming countenance, sir--extremely  calm--benevolence in every feature, sir.
  He quite realises my idea of  King Lear, as he appeared when in possession of his kingdom, Mr  Richard--the same good humour, the same white hair and partial  baldness, the same liability to be imposed upon.
  Ah!  A sweet subject  for contemplation, sir, very sweet!'    Then Mr Garland having alighted and gone up-stairs, Sampson would nod  and smile to Kit from the window, and presently walk out into the  street to greet him, when some such conversation as the following would  ensue.
    'Admirably groomed, Kit'--Mr Brass is patting the pony--'does you great  credit--amazingly sleek and bright to be sure.
  He literally looks as  if he had been varnished all over.
'    Kit touches his hat, smiles, pats the pony himself, and expresses his  conviction, 'that Mr Brass will not find many like him.
'    'A beautiful animal indeed!' cries Brass.
  'Sagacious too?'    'Bless you!' replies Kit, 'he knows what you say to him as well as a  Christian does.
'    'Does he indeed!' cries Brass, who has heard the same thing in the same  place from the same person in the same words a dozen times, but is  paralysed with astonishment notwithstanding.
  'Dear me!'    'I little thought the first time I saw him, Sir,' says Kit, pleased  with the attorney's strong interest in his favourite, 'that I should  come to be as intimate with him as I am now.
'    'Ah!' rejoins Mr Brass, brim-full of moral precepts and love of virtue.
  'A charming subject of reflection for you, very charming.
  A subject of  proper pride and congratulation, Christopher.
  Honesty is the best  policy.
--I always find it so myself.
  I lost forty-seven pound ten by  being honest this morning.
  But it's all gain, it's gain!'    Mr Brass slyly tickles his nose with his pen, and looks at Kit with the  water standing in his eyes.
  Kit thinks that if ever there was a good  man who belied his appearance, that man is Sampson Brass.
    'A man,' says Sampson, 'who loses forty-seven pound ten in one morning  by his honesty, is a man to be envied.
  If it had been eighty pound,  the luxuriousness of feeling would have been increased.
  Every pound  lost, would have been a hundredweight of happiness gained.
  The still  small voice, Christopher,' cries Brass, smiling, and tapping himself on  the bosom, 'is a-singing comic songs within me, and all is happiness  and joy!'    Kit is so improved by the conversation, and finds it go so completely  home to his feelings, that he is considering what he shall say, when Mr  Garland appears.
  The old gentleman is helped into the chaise with  great obsequiousness by Mr Sampson Brass; and the pony, after shaking  his head several times, and standing for three or four minutes with all  his four legs planted firmly on the ground, as if he had made up his  mind never to stir from that spot, but there to live and die, suddenly  darts off, without the smallest notice, at the rate of twelve English  miles an hour.
  Then, Mr Brass and his sister (who has joined him at  the door) exchange an odd kind of smile--not at all a pleasant one in  its expression--and return to the society of Mr Richard Swiveller,  who, during their absence, has been regaling himself with various feats  of pantomime, and is discovered at his desk, in a very flushed and  heated condition, violently scratching out nothing with half a penknife.
    Whenever Kit came alone, and without the chaise, it always happened  that Sampson Brass was reminded of some mission, calling Mr Swiveller,  if not to Peckham Rye again, at all events to some pretty distant place  from which he could not be expected to return for two or three hours,  or in all probability a much longer period, as that gentleman was not,  to say the truth, renowned for using great expedition on such  occasions, but rather for protracting and spinning out the time to the  very utmost limit of possibility.
  Mr Swiveller out of sight, Miss  Sally immediately withdrew.
  Mr Brass would then set the office-door  wide open, hum his old tune with great gaiety of heart, and smile  seraphically as before.
  Kit coming down-stairs would be called in;  entertained with some moral and agreeable conversation; perhaps  entreated to mind the office for an instant while Mr Brass stepped over  the way; and afterwards presented with one or two half-crowns as the  case might be.
  This occurred so often, that Kit, nothing doubting but  that they came from the single gentleman who had already rewarded his  mother with great liberality, could not enough admire his generosity;  and bought so many cheap presents for her, and for little Jacob, and  for the baby, and for Barbara to boot, that one or other of them was  having some new trifle every day of their lives.
    While these acts and deeds were in progress in and out of the office of  Sampson Brass, Richard Swiveller, being often left alone therein, began  to find the time hang heavy on his hands.
  For the better preservation  of his cheerfulness therefore, and to prevent his faculties from  rusting, he provided himself with a cribbage-board and pack of cards,  and accustomed himself to play at cribbage with a dummy, for twenty,  thirty, or sometimes even fifty thousand pounds aside, besides many  hazardous bets to a considerable amount.
    As these games were very silently conducted, notwithstanding the  magnitude of the interests involved, Mr Swiveller began to think that  on those evenings when Mr and Miss Brass were out (and they often went  out now) he heard a kind of snorting or hard-breathing sound in the  direction of the door, which it occurred to him, after some reflection,  must proceed from the small servant, who always had a cold from damp  living.
  Looking intently that way one night, he plainly distinguished  an eye gleaming and glistening at the keyhole; and having now no doubt  that his suspicions were correct, he stole softly to the door, and  pounced upon her before she was aware of his approach.
    'Oh! I didn't mean any harm indeed, upon my word I didn't,' cried the  small servant, struggling like a much larger one.
  'It's so very dull,  down-stairs, Please don't you tell upon me, please don't.
'    'Tell upon you!' said Dick.
  'Do you mean to say you were looking  through the keyhole for company?'    'Yes, upon my word I was,' replied the small servant.
    'How long have you been cooling your eye there?' said Dick.
    'Oh ever since you first began to play them cards, and long before.
'    Vague recollections of several fantastic exercises with which he had  refreshed himself after the fatigues of business, and to all of which,  no doubt, the small servant was a party, rather disconcerted Mr  Swiveller; but he was not very sensitive on such points, and recovered  himself speedily.
    'Well--come in'--he said, after a little consideration.
  'Here--sit  down, and I'll teach you how to play.
'    'Oh! I durstn't do it,' rejoined the small servant; 'Miss Sally 'ud  kill me, if she know'd I come up here.
'    'Have you got a fire down-stairs?' said Dick.
    'A very little one,' replied the small servant.
    'Miss Sally couldn't kill me if she know'd I went down there, so I'll  come,' said Richard, putting the cards into his pocket.
  'Why, how thin  you are!  What do you mean by it?'    'It ain't my fault.
'    'Could you eat any bread and meat?' said Dick, taking down his hat.
  'Yes?  Ah! I thought so.
  Did you ever taste beer?'    'I had a sip of it once,' said the small servant.
    'Here's a state of things!' cried Mr Swiveller, raising his eyes to the  ceiling.
  'She never tasted it--it can't be tasted in a sip!  Why, how  old are you?'    'I don't know.
'    Mr Swiveller opened his eyes very wide, and appeared thoughtful for a  moment; then, bidding the child mind the door until he came back,  vanished straightway.
    Presently, he returned, followed by the boy from the public-house, who  bore in one hand a plate of bread and beef, and in the other a great  pot, filled with some very fragrant compound, which sent forth a  grateful steam, and was indeed choice purl, made after a particular  recipe which Mr Swiveller had imparted to the landlord, at a period  when he was deep in his books and desirous to conciliate his  friendship.
  Relieving the boy of his burden at the door, and charging  his little companion to fasten it to prevent surprise, Mr Swiveller  followed her into the kitchen.
    'There!' said Richard, putting the plate before her.
  'First of all  clear that off, and then you'll see what's next.
'    The small servant needed no second bidding, and the plate was soon  empty.
    'Next,' said Dick, handing the purl, 'take a pull at that; but moderate  your transports, you know, for you're not used to it.
  Well, is it  good?'    'Oh! isn't it?' said the small servant.
    Mr Swiveller appeared gratified beyond all expression by this reply,  and took a long draught himself, steadfastly regarding his companion  while he did so.
  These preliminaries disposed of, he applied himself  to teaching her the game, which she soon learnt tolerably well, being  both sharp-witted and cunning.
    'Now,' said Mr Swiveller, putting two sixpences into a saucer, and  trimming the wretched candle, when the cards had been cut and dealt,  'those are the stakes.
  If you win, you get 'em all.
  If I win, I get  'em.
  To make it seem more real and pleasant, I shall call you the  Marchioness, do you hear?'    The small servant nodded.
    'Then, Marchioness,' said Mr Swiveller, 'fire away!'    The Marchioness, holding her cards very tight in both hands, considered  which to play, and Mr Swiveller, assuming the gay and fashionable air  which such society required, took another pull at the tankard, and  waited for her lead.
              Mr Swiveller and his partner played several rubbers with varying  success, until the loss of three sixpences, the gradual sinking of the  purl, and the striking of ten o'clock, combined to render that  gentleman mindful of the flight of Time, and the expediency of  withdrawing before Mr Sampson and Miss Sally Brass returned.
    'With which object in view, Marchioness,' said Mr Swiveller gravely, 'I  shall ask your ladyship's permission to put the board in my pocket, and  to retire from the presence when I have finished this tankard; merely  observing, Marchioness, that since life like a river is flowing, I care  not how fast it rolls on, ma'am, on, while such purl on the bank still  is growing, and such eyes light the waves as they run.
  Marchioness,  your health.
  You will excuse my wearing my hat, but the palace is  damp, and the marble floor is--if I may be allowed the  expression--sloppy.
'    As a precaution against this latter inconvenience, Mr Swiveller had  been sitting for some time with his feet on the hob, in which attitude  he now gave utterance to these apologetic observations, and slowly  sipped the last choice drops of nectar.
    'The Baron Sampsono Brasso and his fair sister are (you tell me) at the  Play?' said Mr Swiveller, leaning his left arm heavily upon the table,  and raising his voice and his right leg after the manner of a  theatrical bandit.
    The Marchioness nodded.
    'Ha!' said Mr Swiveller, with a portentous frown.
  ''Tis well.
  Marchioness!--but no matter.
  Some wine there.
  Ho!' He illustrated  these melodramatic morsels by handing the tankard to himself with great  humility, receiving it haughtily, drinking from it thirstily, and  smacking his lips fiercely.
    The small servant, who was not so well acquainted with theatrical  conventionalities as Mr Swiveller (having indeed never seen a play, or  heard one spoken of, except by chance through chinks of doors and in  other forbidden places), was rather alarmed by demonstrations so novel  in their nature, and showed her concern so plainly in her looks, that  Mr Swiveller felt it necessary to discharge his brigand manner for one  more suitable to private life, as he asked,    'Do they often go where glory waits 'em, and leave you here?'    'Oh, yes; I believe you they do,' returned the small servant.
  'Miss  Sally's such a one-er for that, she is.
'    'Such a what?' said Dick.
    'Such a one-er,' returned the Marchioness.
    After a moment's reflection, Mr Swiveller determined to forego his  responsible duty of setting her right, and to suffer her to talk on; as  it was evident that her tongue was loosened by the purl, and her  opportunities for conversation were not so frequent as to render a  momentary check of little consequence.
    'They sometimes go to see Mr Quilp,' said the small servant with a  shrewd look; 'they go to a many places, bless you!'    'Is Mr Brass a wunner?' said Dick.
    'Not half what Miss Sally is, he isn't,' replied the small servant,  shaking her head.
  'Bless you, he'd never do anything without her.
'    'Oh!  He wouldn't, wouldn't he?' said Dick.
    'Miss Sally keeps him in such order,' said the small servant; 'he  always asks her advice, he does; and he catches it sometimes.
  Bless  you, you wouldn't believe how much he catches it.
'    'I suppose,' said Dick, 'that they consult together, a good deal, and  talk about a great many people--about me for instance, sometimes, eh,  Marchioness?'    The Marchioness nodded amazingly.
    'Complimentary?' said Mr Swiveller.
    The Marchioness changed the motion of her head, which had not yet left  off nodding, and suddenly began to shake it from side to side, with a  vehemence which threatened to dislocate her neck.
    'Humph!' Dick muttered.
  'Would it be any breach of confidence,  Marchioness, to relate what they say of the humble individual who has  now the honour to--?'    'Miss Sally says you're a funny chap,' replied his friend.
    'Well, Marchioness,' said Mr Swiveller, 'that's not uncomplimentary.
  Merriment, Marchioness, is not a bad or a degrading quality.
  Old King  Cole was himself a merry old soul, if we may put any faith in the pages  of history.
'    'But she says,' pursued his companion, 'that you an't to be trusted.
'    'Why, really Marchioness,' said Mr Swiveller, thoughtfully; 'several  ladies and gentlemen--not exactly professional persons, but  tradespeople, ma'am, tradespeople--have made the same remark.
  The  obscure citizen who keeps the hotel over the way, inclined strongly to  that opinion to-night when I ordered him to prepare the banquet.
  It's  a popular prejudice, Marchioness; and yet I am sure I don't know why,  for I have been trusted in my time to a considerable amount, and I can  safely say that I never forsook my trust until it deserted me--never.
  Mr Brass is of the same opinion, I suppose?'    His friend nodded again, with a cunning look which seemed to hint that  Mr Brass held stronger opinions on the subject than his sister; and  seeming to recollect herself, added imploringly, 'But don't you ever  tell upon me, or I shall be beat to death.
'    'Marchioness,' said Mr Swiveller, rising, 'the word of a gentleman is  as good as his bond--sometimes better, as in the present case, where  his bond might prove but a doubtful sort of security.
  I am your  friend, and I hope we shall play many more rubbers together in this  same saloon.
  But, Marchioness,' added Richard, stopping in his way to  the door, and wheeling slowly round upon the small servant, who was  following with the candle; 'it occurs to me that you must be in the  constant habit of airing your eye at keyholes, to know all this.
'    'I only wanted,' replied the trembling Marchioness, 'to know where the  key of the safe was hid; that was all; and I wouldn't have taken much,  if I had found it--only enough to squench my hunger.
'    'You didn't find it then?' said Dick.
  'But of course you didn't, or  you'd be plumper.
  Good night, Marchioness.
  Fare thee well, and if for  ever, then for ever fare thee well--and put up the chain, Marchioness,  in case of accidents.
'    With this parting injunction, Mr Swiveller emerged from the house; and  feeling that he had by this time taken quite as much to drink as  promised to be good for his constitution (purl being a rather strong  and heady compound), wisely resolved to betake himself to his lodgings,  and to bed at once.
  Homeward he went therefore; and his apartments  (for he still retained the plural fiction) being at no great distance  from the office, he was soon seated in his own bed-chamber, where,  having pulled off one boot and forgotten the other, he fell into deep  cogitation.
    'This Marchioness,' said Mr Swiveller, folding his arms, 'is a very  extraordinary person--surrounded by mysteries, ignorant of the taste of  beer, unacquainted with her own name (which is less remarkable), and  taking a limited view of society through the keyholes of doors--can  these things be her destiny, or has some unknown person started an  opposition to the decrees of fate?  It is a most inscrutable and  unmitigated staggerer!'    When his meditations had attained this satisfactory point, he became  aware of his remaining boot, of which, with unimpaired solemnity he  proceeded to divest himself; shaking his head with exceeding gravity  all the time, and sighing deeply.
    'These rubbers,' said Mr Swiveller, putting on his nightcap in exactly  the same style as he wore his hat, 'remind me of the matrimonial  fireside.
  Cheggs's wife plays cribbage; all-fours likewise.
  She rings  the changes on 'em now.
  From sport to sport they hurry her to banish  her regrets, and when they win a smile from her, they think that she  forgets--but she don't.
  By this time, I should say,' added Richard,  getting his left cheek into profile, and looking complacently at the  reflection of a very little scrap of whisker in the looking-glass; 'by  this time, I should say, the iron has entered into her soul.
  It serves  her right!'    Melting from this stern and obdurate, into the tender and pathetic  mood, Mr Swiveller groaned a little, walked wildly up and down, and  even made a show of tearing his hair, which, however, he thought better  of, and wrenched the tassel from his nightcap instead.
  At last,  undressing himself with a gloomy resolution, he got into bed.
    Some men in his blighted position would have taken to drinking; but as  Mr Swiveller had taken to that before, he only took, on receiving the  news that Sophy Wackles was lost to him for ever, to playing the flute;  thinking after mature consideration that it was a good, sound, dismal  occupation, not only in unison with his own sad thoughts, but  calculated to awaken a fellow-feeling in the bosoms of his neighbours.
  In pursuance of this resolution, he now drew a little table to his  bedside, and arranging the light and a small oblong music-book to the  best advantage, took his flute from its box, and began to play most  mournfully.
    The air was 'Away with melancholy'--a composition, which, when it is  played very slowly on the flute, in bed, with the further disadvantage  of being performed by a gentleman but imperfectly acquainted with the  instrument, who repeats one note a great many times before he can find  the next, has not a lively effect.
  Yet, for half the night, or more,  Mr Swiveller, lying sometimes on his back with his eyes upon the  ceiling, and sometimes half out of bed to correct himself by the book,  played this unhappy tune over and over again; never leaving off, save  for a minute or two at a time to take breath and soliloquise about the  Marchioness, and then beginning again with renewed vigour.
  It was not  until he had quite exhausted his several subjects of meditation, and  had breathed into the flute the whole sentiment of the purl down to its  very dregs, and had nearly maddened the people of the house, and at  both the next doors, and over the way--that he shut up the music-book,  extinguished the candle, and finding himself greatly lightened and  relieved in his mind, turned round and fell asleep.
    He awoke in the morning, much refreshed; and having taken half an  hour's exercise at the flute, and graciously received a notice to quit  from his landlady, who had been in waiting on the stairs for that  purpose since the dawn of day, repaired to Bevis Marks; where the  beautiful Sally was already at her post, bearing in her looks a  radiance, mild as that which beameth from the virgin moon.
    Mr Swiveller acknowledged her presence by a nod, and exchanged his coat  for the aquatic jacket; which usually took some time fitting on, for in  consequence of a tightness in the sleeves, it was only to be got into  by a series of struggles.
  This difficulty overcome, he took his seat  at the desk.
    'I say'--quoth Miss Brass, abruptly breaking silence, 'you haven't seen  a silver pencil-case this morning, have you?'    'I didn't meet many in the street,' rejoined Mr Swiveller.
  'I saw  one--a stout pencil-case of respectable appearance--but as he was in  company with an elderly penknife, and a young toothpick with whom he  was in earnest conversation, I felt a delicacy in speaking to him.
'    'No, but have you?' returned Miss Brass.
  'Seriously, you know.
'    'What a dull dog you must be to ask me such a question seriously,' said  Mr Swiveller.
  'Haven't I this moment come?'    'Well, all I know is,' replied Miss Sally, 'that it's not to be found,  and that it disappeared one day this week, when I left it on the desk.
'    'Halloa!' thought Richard, 'I hope the Marchioness hasn't been at work  here.
'    'There was a knife too,' said Miss Sally, 'of the same pattern.
  They  were given to me by my father, years ago, and are both gone.
  You  haven't missed anything yourself, have you?'    Mr Swiveller involuntarily clapped his hands to the jacket to be quite  sure that it WAS a jacket and not a skirted coat; and having satisfied  himself of the safety of this, his only moveable in Bevis Marks, made  answer in the negative.
    'It's a very unpleasant thing, Dick,' said Miss Brass, pulling out the  tin box and refreshing herself with a pinch of snuff; 'but between you  and me--between friends you know, for if Sammy knew it, I should never  hear the last of it--some of the office-money, too, that has been left  about, has gone in the same way.
  In particular, I have missed three  half-crowns at three different times.
'    'You don't mean that?' cried Dick.
  'Be careful what you say, old boy,  for this is a serious matter.
  Are you quite sure?  Is there no  mistake?'    'It is so, and there can't be any mistake at all,' rejoined Miss Brass  emphatically.
    'Then by Jove,' thought Richard, laying down his pen, 'I am afraid the  Marchioness is done for!'    The more he discussed the subject in his thoughts, the more probable it  appeared to Dick that the miserable little servant was the culprit.
  When he considered on what a spare allowance of food she lived, how  neglected and untaught she was, and how her natural cunning had been  sharpened by necessity and privation, he scarcely doubted it.
  And yet  he pitied her so much, and felt so unwilling to have a matter of such  gravity disturbing the oddity of their acquaintance, that he thought,  and thought truly, that rather than receive fifty pounds down, he would  have the Marchioness proved innocent.
    While he was plunged in very profound and serious meditation upon this  theme, Miss Sally sat shaking her head with an air of great mystery and  doubt; when the voice of her brother Sampson, carolling a cheerful  strain, was heard in the passage, and that gentleman himself, beaming  with virtuous smiles, appeared.
    'Mr Richard, sir, good morning!  Here we are again, sir, entering upon  another day, with our bodies strengthened by slumber and breakfast, and  our spirits fresh and flowing.
  Here we are, Mr Richard, rising with  the sun to run our little course--our course of duty, sir--and, like  him, to get through our day's work with credit to ourselves and  advantage to our fellow-creatures.
  A charming reflection sir, very  charming!'    While he addressed his clerk in these words, Mr Brass was, somewhat  ostentatiously, engaged in minutely examining and holding up against  the light a five-pound bank note, which he had brought in, in his hand.
    Mr Richard not receiving his remarks with anything like enthusiasm, his  employer turned his eyes to his face, and observed that it wore a  troubled expression.
    'You're out of spirits, sir,' said Brass.
  'Mr Richard, sir, we should  fall to work cheerfully, and not in a despondent state.
  It becomes us,  Mr Richard, sir, to--'    Here the chaste Sarah heaved a loud sigh.
    'Dear me!' said Mr Sampson, 'you too!  Is anything the matter?  Mr  Richard, sir--'    Dick, glancing at Miss Sally, saw that she was making signals to him,  to acquaint her brother with the subject of their recent conversation.
  As his own position was not a very pleasant one until the matter was  set at rest one way or other, he did so; and Miss Brass, plying her  snuff-box at a most wasteful rate, corroborated his account.
    The countenance of Sampson fell, and anxiety overspread his features.
  Instead of passionately bewailing the loss of his money, as Miss Sally  had expected, he walked on tiptoe to the door, opened it, looked  outside, shut it softly, returned on tiptoe, and said in a whisper,    'This is a most extraordinary and painful circumstance--Mr Richard,  sir, a most painful circumstance.
  The fact is, that I myself have  missed several small sums from the desk, of late, and have refrained  from mentioning it, hoping that accident would discover the offender;  but it has not done so--it has not done so.
  Sally--Mr Richard,  sir--this is a particularly distressing affair!'    As Sampson spoke, he laid the bank-note upon the desk among some  papers, in an absent manner, and thrust his hands into his pockets.
  Richard Swiveller pointed to it, and admonished him to take it up.
    'No, Mr Richard, sir,' rejoined Brass with emotion, 'I will not take it  up.
  I will let it lie there, sir.
  To take it up, Mr Richard, sir,  would imply a doubt of you; and in you, sir, I have unlimited  confidence.
  We will let it lie there, Sir, if you please, and we will  not take it up by any means.
'  With that, Mr Brass patted him twice or  thrice on the shoulder, in a most friendly manner, and entreated him to  believe that he had as much faith in his honesty as he had in his own.
    Although at another time Mr Swiveller might have looked upon this as a  doubtful compliment, he felt it, under the then-existing circumstances,  a great relief to be assured that he was not wrongfully suspected.
  When he had made a suitable reply, Mr Brass wrung him by the hand, and  fell into a brown study, as did Miss Sally likewise.
  Richard too  remained in a thoughtful state; fearing every moment to hear the  Marchioness impeached, and unable to resist the conviction that she  must be guilty.
    When they had severally remained in this condition for some minutes,  Miss Sally all at once gave a loud rap upon the desk with her clenched  fist, and cried, 'I've hit it!'--as indeed she had, and chipped a piece  out of it too; but that was not her meaning.
    'Well,' cried Brass anxiously.
  'Go on, will you!'    'Why,' replied his sister with an air of triumph, 'hasn't there been  somebody always coming in and out of this office for the last three or  four weeks; hasn't that somebody been left alone in it  sometimes--thanks to you; and do you mean to tell me that that somebody  isn't the thief!'    'What somebody?' blustered Brass.
    'Why, what do you call him--Kit.
'    'Mr Garland's young man?'    'To be sure.
'    'Never!' cried Brass.
  'Never.
  I'll not hear of it.
  Don't tell  me'--said Sampson, shaking his head, and working with both his hands as  if he were clearing away ten thousand cobwebs.
  'I'll never believe it  of him.
  Never!'    'I say,' repeated Miss Brass, taking another pinch of snuff, 'that he's  the thief.
'    'I say,' returned Sampson violently, 'that he is not.
  What do you  mean?  How dare you?  Are characters to be whispered away like this?  Do you know that he's the honestest and faithfullest fellow that ever  lived, and that he has an irreproachable good name?  Come in, come in!'    These last words were not addressed to Miss Sally, though they partook  of the tone in which the indignant remonstrances that preceded them had  been uttered.
  They were addressed to some person who had knocked at  the office-door; and they had hardly passed the lips of Mr Brass, when  this very Kit himself looked in.
    'Is the gentleman up-stairs, sir, if you please?'    'Yes, Kit,' said Brass, still fired with an honest indignation, and  frowning with knotted brows upon his sister; 'Yes Kit, he is.
  I am  glad to see you Kit, I am rejoiced to see you.
  Look in again, as you  come down-stairs, Kit.
  That lad a robber!' cried Brass when he had  withdrawn, 'with that frank and open countenance!  I'd trust him with  untold gold.
  Mr Richard, sir, have the goodness to step directly to  Wrasp and Co.
's in Broad Street, and inquire if they have had  instructions to appear in Carkem and Painter.
  THAT lad a robber,'  sneered Sampson, flushed and heated with his wrath.
  'Am I blind, deaf,  silly; do I know nothing of human nature when I see it before me?  Kit  a robber!  Bah!'    Flinging this final interjection at Miss Sally with immeasurable scorn  and contempt, Sampson Brass thrust his head into his desk, as if to  shut the base world from his view, and breathed defiance from under its  half-closed lid.
              When Kit, having discharged his errand, came down-stairs from the  single gentleman's apartment after the lapse of a quarter of an hour or  so, Mr Sampson Brass was alone in the office.
  He was not singing as  usual, nor was he seated at his desk.
  The open door showed him  standing before the fire with his back towards it, and looking so very  strange that Kit supposed he must have been suddenly taken ill.
    'Is anything the matter, sir?' said Kit.
    'Matter!' cried Brass.
  'No.
  Why anything the matter?'    'You are so very pale,' said Kit, 'that I should hardly have known you.
'    'Pooh pooh! mere fancy,' cried Brass, stooping to throw up the cinders.
  'Never better, Kit, never better in all my life.
  Merry too.
  Ha ha!  How's our friend above-stairs, eh?'    'A great deal better,' said Kit.
    'I'm glad to hear it,' rejoined Brass; 'thankful, I may say.
  An  excellent gentleman--worthy, liberal, generous, gives very little  trouble--an admirable lodger.
  Ha ha!  Mr Garland--he's well I hope,  Kit--and the pony--my friend, my particular friend you know.
  Ha ha!'    Kit gave a satisfactory account of all the little household at Abel  Cottage.
  Mr Brass, who seemed remarkably inattentive and impatient,  mounted on his stool, and beckoning him to come nearer, took him by the  button-hole.
    'I have been thinking, Kit,' said the lawyer, 'that I could throw some  little emoluments in your mother's way--You have a mother, I think?  If  I recollect right, you told me--'    'Oh yes, Sir, yes certainly.
'    'A widow, I think? an industrious widow?'    'A harder-working woman or a better mother never lived, Sir.
'    'Ah!' cried Brass.
  'That's affecting, truly affecting.
  A poor widow  struggling to maintain her orphans in decency and comfort, is a  delicious picture of human goodness.
--Put down your hat, Kit.
'    'Thank you Sir, I must be going directly.
'    'Put it down while you stay, at any rate,' said Brass, taking it from  him and making some confusion among the papers, in finding a place for  it on the desk.
  'I was thinking, Kit, that we have often houses to let  for people we are concerned for, and matters of that sort.
  Now you  know we're obliged to put people into those houses to take care of  'em--very often undeserving people that we can't depend upon.
  What's  to prevent our having a person that we CAN depend upon, and enjoying  the delight of doing a good action at the same time?  I say, what's to  prevent our employing this worthy woman, your mother?  What with one  job and another, there's lodging--and good lodging too--pretty well  all the year round, rent free, and a weekly allowance besides, Kit,  that would provide her with a great many comforts she don't at present  enjoy.
  Now what do you think of that?  Do you see any objection?  My  only desire is to serve you, Kit; therefore if you do, say so freely.
'    As Brass spoke, he moved the hat twice or thrice, and shuffled among  the papers again, as if in search of something.
    'How can I see any objection to such a kind offer, sir?' replied Kit  with his whole heart.
  'I don't know how to thank you sir, I don't  indeed.
'    'Why then,' said Brass, suddenly turning upon him and thrusting his  face close to Kit's with such a repulsive smile that the latter, even  in the very height of his gratitude, drew back, quite startled.
  'Why  then, it's done.
'    Kit looked at him in some confusion.
    'Done, I say,' added Sampson, rubbing his hands and veiling himself  again in his usual oily manner.
  'Ha ha! and so you shall find Kit, so  you shall find.
  But dear me,' said Brass, 'what a time Mr Richard is  gone!  A sad loiterer to be sure!  Will you mind the office one minute,  while I run up-stairs?  Only one minute.
  I'll not detain you an  instant longer, on any account, Kit.
'    Talking as he went, Mr Brass bustled out of the office, and in a very  short time returned.
  Mr Swiveller came back, almost at the same  instant; and as Kit was leaving the room hastily, to make up for lost  time, Miss Brass herself encountered him in the doorway.
    'Oh!' sneered Sally, looking after him as she entered.
  'There goes  your pet, Sammy, eh?'    'Ah!  There he goes,' replied Brass.
  'My pet, if you please.
  An  honest fellow, Mr Richard, sir--a worthy fellow indeed!'    'Hem!' coughed Miss Brass.
    'I tell you, you aggravating vagabond,' said the angry Sampson, 'that  I'd stake my life upon his honesty.
  Am I never to hear the last of  this?  Am I always to be baited, and beset, by your mean suspicions?  Have you no regard for true merit, you malignant fellow?  If you come  to that, I'd sooner suspect your honesty than his.
'    Miss Sally pulled out the tin snuff-box, and took a long, slow pinch,  regarding her brother with a steady gaze all the time.
    'She drives me wild, Mr Richard, sir,' said Brass, 'she exasperates me  beyond all bearing.
  I am heated and excited, sir, I know I am.
  These  are not business manners, sir, nor business looks, but she carries me  out of myself.
'    'Why don't you leave him alone?' said Dick.
    'Because she can't, sir,' retorted Brass; 'because to chafe and vex me  is a part of her nature, Sir, and she will and must do it, or I don't  believe she'd have her health.
  But never mind,' said Brass, 'never  mind.
  I've carried my point.
  I've shown my confidence in the lad.
  He  has minded the office again.
  Ha ha!  Ugh, you viper!'    The beautiful virgin took another pinch, and put the snuff-box in her  pocket; still looking at her brother with perfect composure.
    'He has minded the office again,' said Brass triumphantly; 'he has had  my confidence, and he shall continue to have it; he--why, where's the--'    'What have you lost?' inquired Mr Swiveller.
    'Dear me!' said Brass, slapping all his pockets, one after another, and  looking into his desk, and under it, and upon it, and wildly tossing  the papers about, 'the note, Mr Richard, sir, the five-pound note--what  can have become of it?  I laid it down here--God bless me!'    'What!' cried Miss Sally, starting up, clapping her hands, and  scattering the papers on the floor.
  'Gone!  Now who's right?  Now  who's got it?  Never mind five pounds--what's five pounds?  He's  honest, you know, quite honest.
  It would be mean to suspect him.
  Don't run after him.
  No, no, not for the world!'    'Is it really gone though?' said Dick, looking at Brass with a face as  pale as his own.
    'Upon my word, Mr Richard, Sir,' replied the lawyer, feeling in all his  pockets with looks of the greatest agitation, 'I fear this is a black  business.
  It's certainly gone, Sir.
  What's to be done?'    'Don't run after him,' said Miss Sally, taking more snuff.
  'Don't run  after him on any account.
  Give him time to get rid of it, you know.
  It would be cruel to find him out!'    Mr Swiveller and Sampson Brass looked from Miss Sally to each other, in  a state of bewilderment, and then, as by one impulse, caught up their  hats and rushed out into the street--darting along in the middle of the  road, and dashing aside all obstructions, as though they were running  for their lives.
    It happened that Kit had been running too, though not so fast, and  having the start of them by some few minutes, was a good distance  ahead.
  As they were pretty certain of the road he must have taken,  however, and kept on at a great pace, they came up with him, at the  very moment when he had taken breath, and was breaking into a run again.
    'Stop!' cried Sampson, laying his hand on one shoulder, while Mr  Swiveller pounced upon the other.
  'Not so fast sir.
  You're in a  hurry?'    'Yes, I am,' said Kit, looking from one to the other in great surprise.
    'I--I--can hardly believe it,' panted Sampson, 'but something of value  is missing from the office.
  I hope you don't know what.
'    'Know what! good Heaven, Mr Brass!' cried Kit, trembling from head to  foot; 'you don't suppose--'    'No, no,' rejoined Brass quickly, 'I don't suppose anything.
  Don't say  I said you did.
  You'll come back quietly, I hope?'    'Of course I will,' returned Kit.
  'Why not?'    'To be sure!' said Brass.
  'Why not?  I hope there may turn out to be  no why not.
  If you knew the trouble I've been in, this morning,  through taking your part, Christopher, you'd be sorry for it.
'    'And I am sure you'll be sorry for having suspected me sir,' replied  Kit.
  'Come.
  Let us make haste back.
'    'Certainly!' cried Brass, 'the quicker, the better.
  Mr Richard--have  the goodness, sir, to take that arm.
  I'll take this one.
  It's not  easy walking three abreast, but under these circumstances it must be  done, sir; there's no help for it.
'    Kit did turn from white to red, and from red to white again, when they  secured him thus, and for a moment seemed disposed to resist.
  But,  quickly recollecting himself, and remembering that if he made any  struggle, he would perhaps be dragged by the collar through the public  streets, he only repeated, with great earnestness and with the tears  standing in his eyes, that they would be sorry for this--and suffered  them to lead him off.
  While they were on the way back, Mr Swiveller,  upon whom his present functions sat very irksomely, took an opportunity  of whispering in his ear that if he would confess his guilt, even by so  much as a nod, and promise not to do so any more, he would connive at  his kicking Sampson Brass on the shins and escaping up a court; but Kit  indignantly rejecting this proposal, Mr Richard had nothing for it, but  to hold him tight until they reached Bevis Marks, and ushered him into  the presence of the charming Sarah, who immediately took the precaution  of locking the door.
    'Now, you know,' said Brass, 'if this is a case of innocence, it is a  case of that description, Christopher, where the fullest disclosure is  the best satisfaction for everybody.
  Therefore if you'll consent to an  examination,' he demonstrated what kind of examination he meant by  turning back the cuffs of his coat, 'it will be a comfortable and  pleasant thing for all parties.
'    'Search me,' said Kit, proudly holding up his arms.
  'But mind, sir--I  know you'll be sorry for this, to the last day of your life.
'    'It is certainly a very painful occurrence,' said Brass with a sigh, as  he dived into one of Kit's pockets, and fished up a miscellaneous  collection of small articles; 'very painful.
  Nothing here, Mr Richard,  Sir, all perfectly satisfactory.
  Nor here, sir.
  Nor in the waistcoat,  Mr Richard, nor in the coat tails.
  So far, I am rejoiced, I am sure.
'    Richard Swiveller, holding Kit's hat in his hand, was watching the  proceedings with great interest, and bore upon his face the slightest  possible indication of a smile, as Brass, shutting one of his eyes,  looked with the other up the inside of one of the poor fellow's sleeves  as if it were a telescope--when Sampson turning hastily to him, bade  him search the hat.
    'Here's a handkerchief,' said Dick.
    'No harm in that sir,' rejoined Brass, applying his eye to the other  sleeve, and speaking in the voice of one who was contemplating an  immense extent of prospect.
  'No harm in a handkerchief Sir, whatever.
  The faculty don't consider it a healthy custom, I believe, Mr Richard,  to carry one's handkerchief in one's hat--I have heard that it keeps  the head too warm--but in every other point of view, its being there,  is extremely satisfactory--extremely so.
'    An exclamation, at once from Richard Swiveller, Miss Sally, and Kit  himself, cut the lawyer short.
  He turned his head, and saw Dick  standing with the bank-note in his hand.
    'In the hat?' cried Brass in a sort of shriek.
    'Under the handkerchief, and tucked beneath the lining,' said Dick,  aghast at the discovery.
    Mr Brass looked at him, at his sister, at the walls, at the ceiling, at  the floor--everywhere but at Kit, who stood quite stupefied and  motionless.
    'And this,' cried Sampson, clasping his hands, 'is the world that turns  upon its own axis, and has Lunar influences, and revolutions round  Heavenly Bodies, and various games of that sort!  This is human natur,  is it!  Oh natur, natur!  This is the miscreant that I was going to  benefit with all my little arts, and that, even now, I feel so much  for, as to wish to let him go!  But,' added Mr Brass with greater  fortitude, 'I am myself a lawyer, and bound to set an example in  carrying the laws of my happy country into effect.
  Sally my dear,  forgive me, and catch hold of him on the other side.
  Mr Richard, sir,  have the goodness to run and fetch a constable.
  The weakness is past  and over sir, and moral strength returns.
  A constable, sir, if you  please!'              Kit stood as one entranced, with his eyes opened wide and fixed upon  the ground, regardless alike of the tremulous hold which Mr Brass  maintained on one side of his cravat, and of the firmer grasp of Miss  Sally upon the other; although this latter detention was in itself no  small inconvenience, as that fascinating woman, besides screwing her  knuckles inconveniently into his throat from time to time, had fastened  upon him in the first instance with so tight a grip that even in the  disorder and distraction of his thoughts he could not divest himself of  an uneasy sense of choking.
  Between the brother and sister he remained  in this posture, quite unresisting and passive, until Mr Swiveller  returned, with a police constable at his heels.
    This functionary, being, of course, well used to such scenes; looking  upon all kinds of robbery, from petty larceny up to housebreaking or  ventures on the highway, as matters in the regular course of business;  and regarding the perpetrators in the light of so many customers coming  to be served at the wholesale and retail shop of criminal law where he  stood behind the counter; received Mr Brass's statement of facts with  about as much interest and surprise, as an undertaker might evince if  required to listen to a circumstantial account of the last illness of a  person whom he was called in to wait upon professionally; and took Kit  into custody with a decent indifference.
    'We had better,' said this subordinate minister of justice, 'get to the  office while there's a magistrate sitting.
  I shall want you to come  along with us, Mr Brass, and the--' he looked at Miss Sally as if in  some doubt whether she might not be a griffin or other fabulous monster.
    'The lady, eh?' said Sampson.
    'Ah!' replied the constable.
  'Yes--the lady.
  Likewise the young man  that found the property.
'    'Mr Richard, Sir,' said Brass in a mournful voice.
  'A sad necessity.
  But the altar of our country sir--'    'You'll have a hackney-coach, I suppose?' interrupted the constable,  holding Kit (whom his other captors had released) carelessly by the  arm, a little above the elbow.
  'Be so good as send for one, will you?'    'But, hear me speak a word,' cried Kit, raising his eyes and looking  imploringly about him.
  'Hear me speak a word.
  I am no more guilty  than any one of you.
  Upon my soul I am not.
  I a thief!  Oh, Mr Brass,  you know me better.
  I am sure you know me better.
  This is not right  of you, indeed.
'    'I give you my word, constable--' said Brass.
  But here the constable  interposed with the constitutional principle 'words be blowed;'  observing that words were but spoon-meat for babes and sucklings, and  that oaths were the food for strong men.
    'Quite true, constable,' assented Brass in the same mournful tone.
  'Strictly correct.
  I give you my oath, constable, that down to a few  minutes ago, when this fatal discovery was made, I had such confidence  in that lad, that I'd have trusted him with--a hackney-coach, Mr  Richard, sir; you're very slow, Sir.
'    'Who is there that knows me,' cried Kit, 'that would not trust me--  that does not? ask anybody whether they have ever doubted me; whether I  have ever wronged them of a farthing.
  Was I ever once dishonest when I  was poor and hungry, and is it likely I would begin now!  Oh consider  what you do.
  How can I meet the kindest friends that ever human  creature had, with this dreadful charge upon me!'    Mr Brass rejoined that it would have been well for the prisoner if he  had thought of that before and was about to make some other gloomy  observations when the voice of the single gentleman was heard,  demanding from above-stairs what was the matter, and what was the cause  of all that noise and hurry.
  Kit made an involuntary start towards the  door in his anxiety to answer for himself, but being speedily detained  by the constable, had the agony of seeing Sampson Brass run out alone  to tell the story in his own way.
    'And he can hardly believe it, either,' said Sampson, when he returned,  'nor nobody will.
  I wish I could doubt the evidence of my senses, but  their depositions are unimpeachable.
  It's of no use cross-examining my  eyes,' cried Sampson, winking and rubbing them, 'they stick to their  first account, and will.
  Now, Sarah, I hear the coach in the Marks;  get on your bonnet, and we'll be off.
  A sad errand! a moral funeral,  quite!'    'Mr Brass,' said Kit.
  'Do me one favour.
  Take me to Mr Witherden's  first.
'    Sampson shook his head irresolutely.
    'Do,' said Kit.
  'My master's there.
  For Heaven's sake, take me there,  first.
'    'Well, I don't know,' stammered Brass, who perhaps had his reasons for  wishing to show as fair as possible in the eyes of the notary.
  'How do  we stand in point of time, constable, eh?'    The constable, who had been chewing a straw all this while with great  philosophy, replied that if they went away at once they would have time  enough, but that if they stood shilly-shallying there, any longer, they  must go straight to the Mansion House; and finally expressed his  opinion that that was where it was, and that was all about it.
    Mr Richard Swiveller having arrived inside the coach, and still  remaining immoveable in the most commodious corner with his face to the  horses, Mr Brass instructed the officer to remove his prisoner, and  declared himself quite ready.
  Therefore, the constable, still holding  Kit in the same manner, and pushing him on a little before him, so as  to keep him at about three-quarters of an arm's length in advance  (which is the professional mode), thrust him into the vehicle and  followed himself.
  Miss Sally entered next; and there being now four  inside, Sampson Brass got upon the box, and made the coachman drive on.
    Still completely stunned by the sudden and terrible change which had  taken place in his affairs, Kit sat gazing out of the coach window,  almost hoping to see some monstrous phenomenon in the streets which  might give him reason to believe he was in a dream.
  Alas!  Everything  was too real and familiar: the same succession of turnings, the same  houses, the same streams of people running side by side in different  directions upon the pavement, the same bustle of carts and carriages in  the road, the same well-remembered objects in the shop windows: a  regularity in the very noise and hurry which no dream ever mirrored.
  Dream-like as the story was, it was true.
  He stood charged with  robbery; the note had been found upon him, though he was innocent in  thought and deed; and they were carrying him back, a prisoner.
    Absorbed in these painful ruminations, thinking with a drooping heart  of his mother and little Jacob, feeling as though even the  consciousness of innocence would be insufficient to support him in the  presence of his friends if they believed him guilty, and sinking in  hope and courage more and more as they drew nearer to the notary's,  poor Kit was looking earnestly out of the window, observant of  nothing,--when all at once, as though it had been conjured up by magic,  he became aware of the face of Quilp.
    And what a leer there was upon the face!  It was from the open window  of a tavern that it looked out; and the dwarf had so spread himself  over it, with his elbows on the window-sill and his head resting on  both his hands, that what between this attitude and his being swoln  with suppressed laughter, he looked puffed and bloated into twice his  usual breadth.
  Mr Brass, on recognising him, immediately stopped the  coach.
  As it came to a halt directly opposite to where he stood, the  dwarf pulled off his hat, and saluted the party with a hideous and  grotesque politeness.
    'Aha!' he cried.
  'Where now, Brass? where now? Sally with you too?  Sweet Sally!  And Dick?  Pleasant Dick!  And Kit! Honest Kit!'    'He's extremely cheerful!' said Brass to the coachman.
  'Very much so!  Ah, sir--a sad business!  Never believe in honesty any more, sir.
'    'Why not?' returned the dwarf.
  'Why not, you rogue of a lawyer, why  not?'    'Bank-note lost in our office sir,' said Brass, shaking his head.
  'Found in his hat sir--he previously left alone there--no mistake at  all sir--chain of evidence complete--not a link wanting.
'    'What!' cried the dwarf, leaning half his body out of window.
  'Kit a  thief!  Kit a thief!  Ha ha ha!  Why, he's an uglier-looking thief than  can be seen anywhere for a penny.
  Eh, Kit--eh?  Ha ha ha!  Have you  taken Kit into custody before he had time and opportunity to beat me!  Eh, Kit, eh?'  And with that, he burst into a yell of laughter,  manifestly to the great terror of the coachman, and pointed to a dyer's  pole hard by, where a dangling suit of clothes bore some resemblance to  a man upon a gibbet.
    'Is it coming to that, Kit!' cried the dwarf, rubbing his hands  violently.
  'Ha ha ha ha!  What a disappointment for little Jacob, and  for his darling mother!  Let him have the Bethel minister to comfort  and console him, Brass.
  Eh, Kit, eh?  Drive on coachey, drive on.
  Bye  bye, Kit; all good go with you; keep up your spirits; my love to the  Garlands--the dear old lady and gentleman.
  Say I inquired after 'em,  will you?  Blessings on 'em, on you, and on everybody, Kit.
  Blessings  on all the world!'    With such good wishes and farewells, poured out in a rapid torrent  until they were out of hearing, Quilp suffered them to depart; and when  he could see the coach no longer, drew in his head, and rolled upon the  ground in an ecstacy of enjoyment.
    When they reached the notary's, which they were not long in doing, for  they had encountered the dwarf in a bye street at a very little  distance from the house, Mr Brass dismounted; and opening the coach  door with a melancholy visage, requested his sister to accompany him  into the office, with the view of preparing the good people within, for  the mournful intelligence that awaited them.
  Miss Sally complying, he  desired Mr Swiveller to accompany them.
  So, into the office they went;  Mr Sampson and his sister arm-in-arm; and Mr Swiveller following, alone.
    The notary was standing before the fire in the outer office, talking to  Mr Abel and the elder Mr Garland, while Mr Chuckster sat writing at the  desk, picking up such crumbs of their conversation as happened to fall  in his way.
  This posture of affairs Mr Brass observed through the  glass-door as he was turning the handle, and seeing that the notary  recognised him, he began to shake his head and sigh deeply while that  partition yet divided them.
    'Sir,' said Sampson, taking off his hat, and kissing the two  fore-fingers of his right hand beaver glove, 'my name is Brass--Brass  of Bevis Marks, Sir.
  I have had the honour and pleasure, Sir, of being  concerned against you in some little testamentary matters.
  How do you  do, sir?'    'My clerk will attend to any business you may have come upon, Mr  Brass,' said the notary, turning away.
    'Thank you Sir,' said Brass, 'thank you, I am sure.
  Allow me, Sir, to  introduce my sister--quite one of us Sir, although of the weaker  sex--of great use in my business Sir, I assure you.
  Mr Richard, sir,  have the goodness to come foward if you please--No really,' said Brass,  stepping between the notary and his private office (towards which he  had begun to retreat), and speaking in the tone of an injured man,  'really Sir, I must, under favour, request a word or two with you,  indeed.
'    'Mr Brass,' said the other, in a decided tone, 'I am engaged.
  You see  that I am occupied with these gentlemen.
  If you will communicate your  business to Mr Chuckster yonder, you will receive every attention.
'    'Gentlemen,' said Brass, laying his right hand on his waistcoat, and  looking towards the father and son with a smooth smile--'Gentlemen, I  appeal to you--really, gentlemen--consider, I beg of you.
  I am of the  law.
  I am styled "gentleman" by Act of Parliament.
  I maintain the  title by the annual payment of twelve pound sterling for a certificate.
  I am not one of your players of music, stage actors, writers of books,  or painters of pictures, who assume a station that the laws of their  country don't recognise.
  I am none of your strollers or vagabonds.
  If  any man brings his action against me, he must describe me as a  gentleman, or his action is null and void.
  I appeal to you--is this  quite respectful?  Really gentlemen--'    'Well, will you have the goodness to state your business then, Mr  Brass?' said the notary.
    'Sir,' rejoined Brass, 'I will.
  Ah Mr Witherden! you little know  the--but I will not be tempted to travel from the point, sir, I believe  the name of one of these gentlemen is Garland.
'    'Of both,' said the notary.
    'In-deed!' rejoined Brass, cringing excessively.
  'But I might have  known that, from the uncommon likeness.
  Extremely happy, I am sure, to  have the honour of an introduction to two such gentlemen, although the  occasion is a most painful one.
  One of you gentlemen has a servant  called Kit?'    'Both,' replied the notary.
    'Two Kits?' said Brass smiling.
  'Dear me!'    'One Kit, sir,' returned Mr Witherden angrily, 'who is employed by both  gentlemen.
  What of him?'    'This of him, sir,' rejoined Brass, dropping his voice impressively.
  'That young man, sir, that I have felt unbounded and unlimited  confidence in, and always behaved to as if he was my equal--that young  man has this morning committed a robbery in my office, and been taken  almost in the fact.
'    'This must be some falsehood!' cried the notary.
    'It is not possible,' said Mr Abel.
    'I'll not believe one word of it,' exclaimed the old gentleman.
    Mr Brass looked mildly round upon them, and rejoined,    'Mr Witherden, sir, YOUR words are actionable, and if I was a man of  low and mean standing, who couldn't afford to be slandered, I should  proceed for damages.
  Hows'ever, sir, being what I am, I merely scorn  such expressions.
  The honest warmth of the other gentleman I respect,  and I'm truly sorry to be the messenger of such unpleasant news.
  I  shouldn't have put myself in this painful position, I assure you, but  that the lad himself desired to be brought here in the first instance,  and I yielded to his prayers.
  Mr Chuckster, sir, will you have the  goodness to tap at the window for the constable that's waiting in the  coach?'    The three gentlemen looked at each other with blank faces when these  words were uttered, and Mr Chuckster, doing as he was desired, and  leaping off his stool with something of the excitement of an inspired  prophet whose foretellings had in the fulness of time been realised,  held the door open for the entrance of the wretched captive.
    Such a scene as there was, when Kit came in, and bursting into the rude  eloquence with which Truth at length inspired him, called Heaven to  witness that he was innocent, and that how the property came to be  found upon him he knew not!  Such a confusion of tongues, before the  circumstances were related, and the proofs disclosed!  Such a dead  silence when all was told, and his three friends exchanged looks of  doubt and amazement!    'Is it not possible,' said Mr Witherden, after a long pause, 'that this  note may have found its way into the hat by some accident,--such as  the removal of papers on the desk, for instance?'    But this was clearly shown to be quite impossible.
  Mr Swiveller,  though an unwilling witness, could not help proving to demonstration,  from the position in which it was found, that it must have been  designedly secreted.
    'It's very distressing,' said Brass, 'immensely distressing, I am sure.
  When he comes to be tried, I shall be very happy to recommend him to  mercy on account of his previous good character.
  I did lose money  before, certainly, but it doesn't quite follow that he took it.
  The  presumption's against him--strongly against him--but we're Christians,  I hope?'    'I suppose,' said the constable, looking round, 'that no gentleman here  can give evidence as to whether he's been flush of money of late, Do  you happen to know, Sir?'    'He has had money from time to time, certainly,' returned Mr Garland,  to whom the man had put the question.
  'But that, as he always told me,  was given him by Mr Brass himself.
'    'Yes to be sure,' said Kit eagerly.
  'You can bear me out in that, Sir?'    'Eh?' cried Brass, looking from face to face with an expression of  stupid amazement.
    'The money you know, the half-crowns, that you gave me--from the  lodger,' said Kit.
    'Oh dear me!' cried Brass, shaking his head and frowning heavily.
  'This is a bad case, I find; a very bad case indeed.
'    'What!  Did you give him no money on account of anybody, Sir?' asked Mr  Garland, with great anxiety.
    'I give him money, Sir!' returned Sampson.
  'Oh, come you know, this is  too barefaced.
  Constable, my good fellow, we had better be going.
'    'What!' shrieked Kit.
  'Does he deny that he did? ask him, somebody,  pray.
  Ask him to tell you whether he did or not!'    'Did you, sir?' asked the notary.
    'I tell you what, gentlemen,' replied Brass, in a very grave manner,  'he'll not serve his case this way, and really, if you feel any  interest in him, you had better advise him to go upon some other tack.
  Did I, sir?  Of course I never did.
'    'Gentlemen,' cried Kit, on whom a light broke suddenly, 'Master, Mr  Abel, Mr Witherden, every one of you--he did it!  What I have done to  offend him, I don't know, but this is a plot to ruin me.
  Mind,  gentlemen, it's a plot, and whatever comes of it, I will say with my  dying breath that he put that note in my hat himself!  Look at him,  gentlemen! see how he changes colour.
  Which of us looks the guilty  person--he, or I?'    'You hear him, gentlemen?' said Brass, smiling, 'you hear him.
  Now,  does this case strike you as assuming rather a black complexion, or  does it not?  Is it at all a treacherous case, do you think, or is it  one of mere ordinary guilt?  Perhaps, gentlemen, if he had not said  this in your presence and I had reported it, you'd have held this to be  impossible likewise, eh?'    With such pacific and bantering remarks did Mr Brass refute the foul  aspersion on his character; but the virtuous Sarah, moved by stronger  feelings, and having at heart, perhaps, a more jealous regard for the  honour of her family, flew from her brother's side, without any  previous intimation of her design, and darted at the prisoner with the  utmost fury.
  It would undoubtedly have gone hard with Kit's face, but  that the wary constable, foreseeing her design, drew him aside at the  critical moment, and thus placed Mr Chuckster in circumstances of some  jeopardy; for that gentleman happening to be next the object of Miss  Brass's wrath; and rage being, like love and fortune, blind; was  pounced upon by the fair enslaver, and had a false collar plucked up by  the roots, and his hair very much dishevelled, before the exertions of  the company could make her sensible of her mistake.
    The constable, taking warning by this desperate attack, and thinking  perhaps that it would be more satisfactory to the ends of justice if  the prisoner were taken before a magistrate, whole, rather than in  small pieces, led him back to the hackney-coach without more ado, and  moreover insisted on Miss Brass becoming an outside passenger; to which  proposal the charming creature, after a little angry discussion,  yielded her consent; and so took her brother Sampson's place upon the  box: Mr Brass with some reluctance agreeing to occupy her seat inside.
  These arrangements perfected, they drove to the justice-room with all  speed, followed by the notary and his two friends in another coach.
  Mr  Chuckster alone was left behind--greatly to his indignation; for he  held the evidence he could have given, relative to Kit's returning to  work out the shilling, to be so very material as bearing upon his  hypocritical and designing character, that he considered its  suppression little better than a compromise of felony.
    At the justice-room, they found the single gentleman, who had gone  straight there, and was expecting them with desperate impatience.
  But  not fifty single gentlemen rolled into one could have helped poor Kit,  who in half an hour afterwards was committed for trial, and was assured  by a friendly officer on his way to prison that there was no occasion  to be cast down, for the sessions would soon be on, and he would, in  all likelihood, get his little affair disposed of, and be comfortably  transported, in less than a fortnight.
              Let moralists and philosophers say what they may, it is very  questionable whether a guilty man would have felt half as much misery  that night, as Kit did, being innocent.
  The world, being in the  constant commission of vast quantities of injustice, is a little too  apt to comfort itself with the idea that if the victim of its falsehood  and malice have a clear conscience, he cannot fail to be sustained  under his trials, and somehow or other to come right at last; 'in which  case,' say they who have hunted him down, '--though we certainly don't  expect it--nobody will be better pleased than we.
'  Whereas, the world  would do well to reflect, that injustice is in itself, to every  generous and properly constituted mind, an injury, of all others the  most insufferable, the most torturing, and the most hard to bear; and  that many clear consciences have gone to their account elsewhere, and  many sound hearts have broken, because of this very reason; the  knowledge of their own deserts only aggravating their sufferings, and  rendering them the less endurable.
    The world, however, was not in fault in Kit's case.
  But Kit was  innocent; and knowing this, and feeling that his best friends deemed  him guilty--that Mr and Mrs Garland would look upon him as a monster of  ingratitude--that Barbara would associate him with all that was bad and  criminal--that the pony would consider himself forsaken--and that even  his own mother might perhaps yield to the strong appearances against  him, and believe him to be the wretch he seemed--knowing and feeling  all this, he experienced, at first, an agony of mind which no words can  describe, and walked up and down the little cell in which he was locked  up for the night, almost beside himself with grief.
    Even when the violence of these emotions had in some degree subsided,  and he was beginning to grow more calm, there came into his mind a new  thought, the anguish of which was scarcely less.
  The child--the bright  star of the simple fellow's life--she, who always came back upon him  like a beautiful dream--who had made the poorest part of his existence,  the happiest and best--who had ever been so gentle, and considerate,  and good--if she were ever to hear of this, what would she think!  As  this idea occurred to him, the walls of the prison seemed to melt away,  and the old place to reveal itself in their stead, as it was wont to be  on winter nights--the fireside, the little supper table, the old man's  hat, and coat, and stick--the half-opened door, leading to her little  room--they were all there.
  And Nell herself was there, and he--both  laughing heartily as they had often done--and when he had got as far as  this, Kit could go no farther, but flung himself upon his poor bedstead  and wept.
    It was a long night, which seemed as though it would have no end; but  he slept too, and dreamed--always of being at liberty, and roving  about, now with one person and now with another, but ever with a vague  dread of being recalled to prison; not that prison, but one which was  in itself a dim idea--not of a place, but of a care and sorrow: of  something oppressive and always present, and yet impossible to define.
  At last, the morning dawned, and there was the jail itself--cold,  black, and dreary, and very real indeed.
    He was left to himself,  however, and there was comfort in that.
  He had liberty to walk in a  small paved yard at a certain hour, and learnt from the turnkey, who  came to unlock his cell and show him where to wash, that there was a  regular time for visiting, every day, and that if any of his friends  came to see him, he would be fetched down to the grate.
  When he had  given him this information, and a tin porringer containing his  breakfast, the man locked him up again; and went clattering along the  stone passage, opening and shutting a great many other doors, and  raising numberless loud echoes which resounded through the building for  a long time, as if they were in prison too, and unable to get out.
    This turnkey had given him to understand that he was lodged, like some  few others in the jail, apart from the mass of prisoners; because he  was not supposed to be utterly depraved and irreclaimable, and had  never occupied apartments in that mansion before.
  Kit was thankful for  this indulgence, and sat reading the church catechism very attentively  (though he had known it by heart from a little child), until he heard  the key in the lock, and the man entered again.
    'Now then,' he said, 'come on!'    'Where to, Sir?' asked Kit.
    The man contented himself by briefly replying 'Wisitors;' and taking  him by the arm in exactly the same manner as the constable had done the  day before, led him, through several winding ways and strong gates,  into a passage, where he placed him at a grating and turned upon his  heel.
  Beyond this grating, at the distance of about four or five feet,  was another exactly like it.
  In the space between, sat a turnkey  reading a newspaper, and outside the further railing, Kit saw, with a  palpitating heart, his mother with the baby in her arms; Barbara's  mother with her never-failing umbrella; and poor little Jacob, staring  in with all his might, as though he were looking for the bird, or the  wild beast, and thought the men were mere accidents with whom the bars  could have no possible concern.
    But when little Jacob saw his brother, and, thrusting his arms between  the rails to hug him, found that he came no nearer, but still stood  afar off with his head resting on the arm by which he held to one of  the bars, he began to cry most piteously; whereupon, Kit's mother and  Barbara's mother, who had restrained themselves as much as possible,  burst out sobbing and weeping afresh.
  Poor Kit could not help joining  them, and not one of them could speak a word.
  During this melancholy  pause, the turnkey read his newspaper with a waggish look (he had  evidently got among the facetious paragraphs) until, happening to take  his eyes off for an instant, as if to get by dint of contemplation at  the very marrow of some joke of a deeper sort than the rest, it  appeared to occur to him, for the first time, that somebody was crying.
    'Now, ladies, ladies,' he said, looking round with surprise, 'I'd  advise you not to waste time like this.
  It's allowanced here, you  know.
  You mustn't let that child make that noise either.
  It's against  all rules.
'    'I'm his poor mother, sir,'--sobbed Mrs Nubbles, curtseying humbly,  'and this is his brother, sir.
  Oh dear me, dear me!'    'Well!' replied the turnkey, folding his paper on his knee, so as to  get with greater convenience at the top of the next column.
  'It can't  be helped you know.
  He ain't the only one in the same fix.
  You  mustn't make a noise about it!'    With that he went on reading.
  The man was not unnaturally cruel or  hard-hearted.
  He had come to look upon felony as a kind of disorder,  like the scarlet fever or erysipelas: some people had it--some  hadn't--just as it might be.
    'Oh! my darling Kit,' said his mother, whom Barbara's mother had  charitably relieved of the baby, 'that I should see my poor boy here!'    'You don't believe that I did what they accuse me of, mother dear?'  cried Kit, in a choking voice.
    'I believe it!' exclaimed the poor woman, 'I that never knew you tell a  lie, or do a bad action from your cradle--that have never had a  moment's sorrow on your account, except it was the poor meals that you  have taken with such good humour and content, that I forgot how little  there was, when I thought how kind and thoughtful you were, though you  were but a child!--I believe it of the son that's been a comfort to me  from the hour of his birth until this time, and that I never laid down  one night in anger with!  I believe it of you Kit!--'    'Why then, thank God!' said Kit, clutching the bars with an earnestness  that shook them, 'and I can bear it, mother!  Come what may, I shall  always have one drop of happiness in my heart when I think that you  said that.
'    At this the poor woman fell a-crying again, and Barbara's mother too.
  And little Jacob, whose disjointed thoughts had by this time resolved  themselves into a pretty distinct impression that Kit couldn't go out  for a walk if he wanted, and that there were no birds, lions, tigers or  other natural curiosities behind those bars--nothing indeed, but a  caged brother--added his tears to theirs with as little noise as  possible.
    Kit's mother, drying her eyes (and moistening them, poor soul, more  than she dried them), now took from the ground a small basket, and  submissively addressed herself to the turnkey, saying, would he please  to listen to her for a minute?  The turnkey, being in the very crisis  and passion of a joke, motioned to her with his hand to keep silent one  minute longer, for her life.
  Nor did he remove his hand into its  former posture, but kept it in the same warning attitude until he had  finished the paragraph, when he paused for a few seconds, with a smile  upon his face, as who should say 'this editor is a comical blade--a  funny dog,' and then asked her what she wanted.
    'I have brought him a little something to eat,' said the good woman.
  'If you please, Sir, might he have it?'    'Yes,--he may have it.
  There's no rule against that.
  Give it to me  when you go, and I'll take care he has it.
'    'No, but if you please sir--don't be angry with me sir--I am his  mother, and you had a mother once--if I might only see him eat a little  bit, I should go away, so much more satisfied that he was all  comfortable.
'    And again the tears of Kit's mother burst forth, and of Barbara's  mother, and of little Jacob.
  As to the baby, it was crowing and  laughing with its might--under the idea, apparently, that the whole  scene had been invented and got up for its particular satisfaction.
    The turnkey looked as if he thought the request a strange one and  rather out of the common way, but nevertheless he laid down his paper,  and coming round where Kit's mother stood, took the basket from her,  and after inspecting its contents, handed it to Kit, and went back to  his place.
  It may be easily conceived that the prisoner had no great  appetite, but he sat down on the ground, and ate as hard as he could,  while, at every morsel he put into his mouth, his mother sobbed and  wept afresh, though with a softened grief that bespoke the satisfaction  the sight afforded her.
    While he was thus engaged, Kit made some anxious inquiries about his  employers, and whether they had expressed any opinion concerning him;  but all he could learn was that Mr Abel had himself broken the  intelligence to his mother, with great kindness and delicacy, late on  the previous night, but had himself expressed no opinion of his  innocence or guilt.
  Kit was on the point of mustering courage to ask  Barbara's mother about Barbara, when the turnkey who had conducted him,  reappeared, a second turnkey appeared behind his visitors, and the  third turnkey with the newspaper cried 'Time's up!'--adding in the same  breath 'Now for the next party!' and then plunging deep into his  newspaper again.
  Kit was taken off in an instant, with a blessing from  his mother, and a scream from little Jacob, ringing in his ears.
  As he  was crossing the next yard with the basket in his hand, under the  guidance of his former conductor, another officer called to them to  stop, and came up with a pint pot of porter in his hand.
    'This is Christopher Nubbles, isn't it, that come in last night for  felony?' said the man.
    His comrade replied that this was the chicken in question.
    'Then here's your beer,' said the other man to Christopher.
  'What are  you looking at?  There an't a discharge in it.
'    'I beg your pardon,' said Kit.
  'Who sent it me?'    'Why, your friend,' replied the man.
  'You're to have it every day, he  says.
  And so you will, if he pays for it.
'    'My friend!' repeated Kit.
    'You're all abroad, seemingly,' returned the other man.
  'There's his  letter.
  Take hold!'    Kit took it, and when he was locked up again, read as follows.
    'Drink of this cup, you'll find there's a spell in its every drop  'gainst the ills of mortality.
  Talk of the cordial that sparkled for  Helen!  HER cup was a fiction, but this is reality (Barclay and  Co.
's).
--If they ever send it in a flat state, complain to the  Governor.
  Yours, R.
 S.
'    'R.
 S.
!' said Kit, after some consideration.
  'It must be Mr Richard  Swiveller.
  Well, its very kind of him, and I thank him heartily.
'              A faint light, twinkling from the window of the counting-house on  Quilp's wharf, and looking inflamed and red through the night-fog, as  though it suffered from it like an eye, forewarned Mr Sampson Brass, as  he approached the wooden cabin with a cautious step, that the excellent  proprietor, his esteemed client, was inside, and probably waiting with  his accustomed patience and sweetness of temper the fulfilment of the  appointment which now brought Mr Brass within his fair domain.
    'A treacherous place to pick one's steps in, of a dark night,' muttered  Sampson, as he stumbled for the twentieth time over some stray lumber,  and limped in pain.
  'I believe that boy strews the ground differently  every day, on purpose to bruise and maim one; unless his master does it  with his own hands, which is more than likely.
  I hate to come to this  place without Sally.
  She's more protection than a dozen men.
'    As he paid this compliment to the merit of the absent charmer, Mr Brass  came to a halt; looking doubtfully towards the light, and over his  shoulder.
    'What's he about, I wonder?' murmured the lawyer, standing on tiptoe,  and endeavouring to obtain a glimpse of what was passing inside, which  at that distance was impossible--'drinking, I suppose,--making himself  more fiery and furious, and heating his malice and mischievousness till  they boil.
  I'm always afraid to come here by myself, when his  account's a pretty large one.
  I don't believe he'd mind throttling me,  and dropping me softly into the river when the tide was at its  strongest, any more than he'd mind killing a rat--indeed I don't know  whether he wouldn't consider it a pleasant joke.
  Hark!  Now he's  singing!'    Mr Quilp was certainly entertaining himself with vocal exercise, but it  was rather a kind of chant than a song; being a monotonous repetition  of one sentence in a very rapid manner, with a long stress upon the  last word, which he swelled into a dismal roar.
  Nor did the burden of  this performance bear any reference to love, or war, or wine, or  loyalty, or any other, the standard topics of song, but to a subject  not often set to music or generally known in ballads; the words being  these:--'The worthy magistrate, after remarking that the prisoner would  find some difficulty in persuading a jury to believe his tale,  committed him to take his trial at the approaching sessions; and  directed the customary recognisances to be entered into for the  pros-e-cu-tion.
'    Every time he came to this concluding word, and had exhausted all  possible stress upon it, Quilp burst into a shriek of laughter, and  began again.
    'He's dreadfully imprudent,' muttered Brass, after he had listened to  two or three repetitions of the chant.
  'Horribly imprudent.
  I wish he  was dumb.
  I wish he was deaf.
  I wish he was blind.
  Hang him,' cried  Brass, as the chant began again.
  'I wish he was dead!'    Giving utterance to these friendly aspirations in behalf of his client,  Mr Sampson composed his face into its usual state of smoothness, and  waiting until the shriek came again and was dying away, went up to the  wooden house, and knocked at the door.
    'Come in!' cried the dwarf.
    'How do you do to-night sir?' said Sampson, peeping in.
  'Ha ha ha!  How do you do sir?  Oh dear me, how very whimsical!  Amazingly  whimsical to be sure!'    'Come in, you fool!' returned the dwarf, 'and don't stand there shaking  your head and showing your teeth.
  Come in, you false witness, you  perjurer, you suborner of evidence, come in!'    'He has the richest humour!' cried Brass, shutting the door behind him;  'the most amazing vein of comicality!  But isn't it rather injudicious,  sir--?'    'What?' demanded Quilp.
  'What, Judas?'    'Judas!' cried Brass.
  'He has such extraordinary spirits!  His humour  is so extremely playful!  Judas!  Oh yes--dear me, how very good!  Ha  ha ha!'    All this time, Sampson was rubbing his hands, and staring, with  ludicrous surprise and dismay, at a great, goggle-eyed, blunt-nosed  figure-head of some old ship, which was reared up against the wall in a  corner near the stove, looking like a goblin or hideous idol whom the  dwarf worshipped.
  A mass of timber on its head, carved into the dim  and distant semblance of a cocked hat, together with a representation  of a star on the left breast and epaulettes on the shoulders, denoted  that it was intended for the effigy of some famous admiral; but,  without those helps, any observer might have supposed it the authentic  portrait of a distinguished merman, or great sea-monster.
  Being  originally much too large for the apartment which it was now employed  to decorate, it had been sawn short off at the waist.
  Even in this  state it reached from floor to ceiling; and thrusting itself forward,  with that excessively wide-awake aspect, and air of somewhat obtrusive  politeness, by which figure-heads are usually characterised, seemed to  reduce everything else to mere pigmy proportions.
    'Do you know it?' said the dwarf, watching Sampson's eyes.
  'Do you see  the likeness?'    'Eh?' said Brass, holding his head on one side, and throwing it a  little back, as connoisseurs do.
  'Now I look at it again, I fancy I  see a--yes, there certainly is something in the smile that reminds me  of--and yet upon my word I--'    Now, the fact was, that Sampson, having never seen anything in the  smallest degree resembling this substantial phantom, was much  perplexed; being uncertain whether Mr Quilp considered it like himself,  and had therefore bought it for a family portrait; or whether he was  pleased to consider it as the likeness of some enemy.
  He was not very  long in doubt; for, while he was surveying it with that knowing look  which people assume when they are contemplating for the first time  portraits which they ought to recognise but don't, the dwarf threw down  the newspaper from which he had been chanting the words already quoted,  and seizing a rusty iron bar, which he used in lieu of poker, dealt the  figure such a stroke on the nose that it rocked again.
    'Is it like Kit--is it his picture, his image, his very self?' cried  the dwarf, aiming a shower of blows at the insensible countenance, and  covering it with deep dimples.
  'Is it the exact model and counterpart  of the dog--is it--is it--is it?'  And with every repetition of the  question, he battered the great image, until the perspiration streamed  down his face with the violence of the exercise.
    Although this might have been a very comical thing to look at from a  secure gallery, as a bull-fight is found to be a comfortable spectacle  by those who are not in the arena, and a house on fire is better than a  play to people who don't live near it, there was something in the  earnestness of Mr Quilp's manner which made his legal adviser feel that  the counting-house was a little too small, and a deal too lonely, for  the complete enjoyment of these humours.
  Therefore, he stood as far  off as he could, while the dwarf was thus engaged; whimpering out but  feeble applause; and when Quilp left off and sat down again from pure  exhaustion, approached with more obsequiousness than ever.
    'Excellent indeed!' cried Brass.
  'He he!  Oh, very good Sir.
  You  know,' said Sampson, looking round as if in appeal to the bruised  animal, 'he's quite a remarkable man--quite!'    'Sit down,' said the dwarf.
  'I bought the dog yesterday.
  I've been  screwing gimlets into him, and sticking forks in his eyes, and cutting  my name on him.
  I mean to burn him at last.
'    'Ha ha!' cried Brass.
  'Extremely entertaining, indeed!'    'Come here,' said Quilp, beckoning him to draw near.
  'What's  injudicious, hey?'    'Nothing Sir--nothing.
  Scarcely worth mentioning Sir; but I thought  that song--admirably humorous in itself you know--was perhaps rather--'    'Yes,' said Quilp, 'rather what?'    'Just bordering, or as one may say remotely verging, upon the confines  of injudiciousness perhaps, Sir,' returned Brass, looking timidly at  the dwarf's cunning eyes, which were turned towards the fire and  reflected its red light.
    'Why?' inquired Quilp, without looking up.
    'Why, you know, sir,' returned Brass, venturing to be more familiar:  '--the fact is, sir, that any allusion to these little combinings  together, of friends, for objects in themselves extremely laudable, but  which the law terms conspiracies, are--you take me, sir?--best kept  snug and among friends, you know.
'    'Eh!' said Quilp, looking up with a perfectly vacant countenance.
  'What do you mean?'    'Cautious, exceedingly cautious, very right and proper!' cried Brass,  nodding his head.
  'Mum, sir, even here--my meaning, sir, exactly.
'    'YOUR meaning exactly, you brazen scarecrow,--what's your meaning?'  retorted Quilp.
  'Why do you talk to me of combining together?  Do I  combine?  Do I know anything about your combinings?'    'No no, sir--certainly not; not by any means,' returned Brass.
    'If you so wink and nod at me,' said the dwarf, looking about him as if  for his poker, 'I'll spoil the expression of your monkey's face, I  will.
'    'Don't put yourself out of the way I beg, sir,' rejoined Brass,  checking himself with great alacrity.
  'You're quite right, sir, quite  right.
  I shouldn't have mentioned the subject, sir.
  It's much better  not to.
  You're quite right, sir.
  Let us change it, if you please.
  You were asking, sir, Sally told me, about our lodger.
  He has not  returned, sir.
'    'No?' said Quilp, heating some rum in a little saucepan, and watching  it to prevent its boiling over.
  'Why not?'    'Why, sir,' returned Brass, 'he--dear me, Mr Quilp, sir--'    'What's the matter?' said the dwarf, stopping his hand in the act of  carrying the saucepan to his mouth.
    'You have forgotten the water, sir,' said Brass.
  'And--excuse me,  sir--but it's burning hot.
'    Deigning no other than a practical answer to this remonstrance, Mr  Quilp raised the hot saucepan to his lips, and deliberately drank off  all the spirit it contained, which might have been in quantity about  half a pint, and had been but a moment before, when he took it off the  fire, bubbling and hissing fiercely.
  Having swallowed this gentle  stimulant, and shaken his fist at the admiral, he bade Mr Brass proceed.
    'But first,' said Quilp, with his accustomed grin, 'have a drop  yourself--a nice drop--a good, warm, fiery drop.
'    'Why, sir,' replied Brass, 'if there was such a thing as a mouthful of  water that could be got without trouble--'    'There's no such thing to be had here,' cried the dwarf.
  'Water for  lawyers!  Melted lead and brimstone, you mean, nice hot blistering  pitch and tar--that's the thing for them--eh, Brass, eh?'    'Ha ha ha!' laughed Mr Brass.
  'Oh very biting! and yet it's like being  tickled--there's a pleasure in it too, sir!'    'Drink that,' said the dwarf, who had by this time heated some more.
  'Toss it off, don't leave any heeltap, scorch your throat and be happy!'    The wretched Sampson took a few short sips of the liquor, which  immediately distilled itself into burning tears, and in that form came  rolling down his cheeks into the pipkin again, turning the colour of  his face and eyelids to a deep red, and giving rise to a violent fit of  coughing, in the midst of which he was still heard to declare, with the  constancy of a martyr, that it was 'beautiful indeed!'  While he was  yet in unspeakable agonies, the dwarf renewed their conversation.
    'The lodger,' said Quilp, '--what about him?'    'He is still, sir,'  returned Brass, with intervals of coughing, 'stopping with the Garland  family.
  He has only been home once, Sir, since the day of the  examination of that culprit.
  He informed Mr Richard, sir, that he  couldn't bear the house after what had taken place; that he was  wretched in it; and that he looked upon himself as being in a certain  kind of way the cause of the occurrence.
--A very excellent lodger Sir.
  I hope we may not lose him.
'    'Yah!' cried the dwarf.
  'Never thinking of anybody but yourself--why  don't you retrench then--scrape up, hoard, economise, eh?'    'Why, sir,' replied Brass, 'upon my word I think Sarah's as good an  economiser as any going.
  I do indeed, Mr Quilp.
'    'Moisten your clay, wet the other eye, drink, man!' cried the dwarf.
  'You took a clerk to oblige me.
'    'Delighted, sir, I am sure, at any time,' replied Sampson.
  'Yes, Sir,  I did.
'    'Then now you may discharge him,' said Quilp.
  'There's a means of  retrenchment for you at once.
'    'Discharge Mr Richard, sir?' cried Brass.
    'Have you more than one clerk, you parrot, that you ask the question?  Yes.
'    'Upon my word, Sir,' said Brass, 'I wasn't prepared for this--'    'How could you be?' sneered the dwarf, 'when I wasn't?  How often am I  to tell you that I brought him to you that I might always have my eye  on him and know where he was--and that I had a plot, a scheme, a little  quiet piece of enjoyment afoot, of which the very cream and essence  was, that this old man and grandchild (who have sunk underground I  think) should be, while he and his precious friend believed them rich,  in reality as poor as frozen rats?'    'I quite understood that, sir,' rejoined Brass.
  'Thoroughly.
'    'Well, Sir,' retorted Quilp, 'and do you understand now, that they're  not poor--that they can't be, if they have such men as your lodger  searching for them, and scouring the country far and wide?'    'Of course I do, Sir,' said Sampson.
    'Of course you do,' retorted the dwarf, viciously snapping at his  words.
  'Of course do you understand then, that it's no matter what  comes of this fellow? of course do you understand that for any other  purpose he's no man for me, nor for you?'    'I have frequently said to Sarah, sir,' returned Brass, 'that he was of  no use at all in the business.
  You can't put any confidence in him,  sir.
  If you'll believe me I've found that fellow, in the commonest  little matters of the office that have been trusted to him, blurting  out the truth, though expressly cautioned.
  The aggravation of that  chap sir, has exceeded anything you can imagine, it has indeed.
  Nothing but the respect and obligation I owe to you, sir--'    As it was plain that Sampson was bent on a complimentary harangue,  unless he received a timely interruption, Mr Quilp politely tapped him  on the crown of his head with the little saucepan, and requested that  he would be so obliging as to hold his peace.
    'Practical, sir, practical,' said Brass, rubbing the place and smiling;  'but still extremely pleasant--immensely so!'    'Hearken to me, will you?' returned Quilp, 'or I'll be a little more  pleasant, presently.
  There's no chance of his comrade and friend  returning.
  The scamp has been obliged to fly, as I learn, for some  knavery, and has found his way abroad.
  Let him rot there.
'    'Certainly, sir.
  Quite proper.
--Forcible!' cried Brass, glancing at  the admiral again, as if he made a third in company.
  'Extremely  forcible!'    'I hate him,' said Quilp between his teeth, 'and have always hated him,  for family reasons.
  Besides, he was an intractable ruffian; otherwise  he would have been of use.
  This fellow is pigeon-hearted and  light-headed.
  I don't want him any longer.
  Let him hang or  drown--starve--go to the devil.
'    'By all means, sir,' returned Brass.
  'When would you wish him, sir,  to--ha, ha!--to make that little excursion?'    'When this trial's over,' said Quilp.
  'As soon as that's ended, send  him about his business.
'    'It shall be done, sir,' returned Brass; 'by all means.
  It will be  rather a blow to Sarah, sir, but she has all her feelings under  control.
  Ah, Mr Quilp, I often think, sir, if it had only pleased  Providence to bring you and Sarah together, in earlier life, what  blessed results would have flowed from such a union!  You never saw our  dear father, sir?--A charming gentleman.
  Sarah was his pride and joy,  sir.
  He would have closed his eyes in bliss, would Foxey, Mr Quilp, if  he could have found her such a partner.
  You esteem her, sir?'    'I love her,' croaked the dwarf.
    'You're very good, Sir,' returned Brass, 'I am sure.
  Is there any  other order, sir, that I can take a note of, besides this little matter  of Mr Richard?'    'None,' replied the dwarf, seizing the saucepan.
  'Let us drink the  lovely Sarah.
'    'If we could do it in something, sir, that wasn't quite boiling,'  suggested Brass humbly, 'perhaps it would be better.
  I think it will  be more agreeable to Sarah's feelings, when she comes to hear from me  of the honour you have done her, if she learns it was in liquor rather  cooler than the last, Sir.
'    But to these remonstrances, Mr Quilp turned a deaf ear.
  Sampson Brass,  who was, by this time, anything but sober, being compelled to take  further draughts of the same strong bowl, found that, instead of at all  contributing to his recovery, they had the novel effect of making the  counting-house spin round and round with extreme velocity, and causing  the floor and ceiling to heave in a very distressing manner.
  After a  brief stupor, he awoke to a consciousness of being partly under the  table and partly under the grate.
  This position not being the most  comfortable one he could have chosen for himself, he managed to stagger  to his feet, and, holding on by the admiral, looked round for his host.
    Mr Brass's first impression was, that his host was gone and had left  him there alone--perhaps locked him in for the night.
  A strong smell  of tobacco, however, suggested a new train of ideas, he looked upward,  and saw that the dwarf was smoking in his hammock.
    'Good bye, Sir,' cried Brass faintly.
  'Good bye, Sir.
'    'Won't you stop all night?' said the dwarf, peeping out.
  'Do stop all  night!'    'I couldn't indeed, Sir,' replied Brass, who was almost dead from  nausea and the closeness of the room.
  'If you'd have the goodness to  show me a light, so that I may see my way across the yard, sir--'    Quilp was out in an instant; not with his legs first, or his head  first, or his arms first, but bodily--altogether.
    'To be sure,' he said, taking up a lantern, which was now the only  light in the place.
  'Be careful how you go, my dear friend.
  Be sure  to pick your way among the timber, for all the rusty nails are upwards.
  There's a dog in the lane.
  He bit a man last night, and a woman the  night before, and last Tuesday he killed a child--but that was in play.
  Don't go too near him.
'    'Which side of the road is he, sir?' asked Brass, in great dismay.
    'He lives on the right hand,' said Quilp, 'but sometimes he hides on  the left, ready for a spring.
  He's uncertain in that respect.
  Mind  you take care of yourself.
  I'll never forgive you if you don't.
  There's the light out--never mind--you know the way--straight on!'  Quilp had slily shaded the light by holding it against his breast, and  now stood chuckling and shaking from head to foot in a rapture of  delight, as he heard the lawyer stumbling up the yard, and now and then  falling heavily down.
  At length, however, he got quit of the place,  and was out of hearing.
    The dwarf shut himself up again, and sprang once more into his hammock.
              The professional gentleman who had given Kit the consolatory piece of  information relative to the settlement of his trifle of business at the  Old Bailey, and the probability of its being very soon disposed of,  turned out to be quite correct in his prognostications.
  In eight days'  time, the sessions commenced.
  In one day afterwards, the Grand Jury  found a True Bill against Christopher Nubbles for felony; and in two  days from that finding, the aforesaid Christopher Nubbles was called  upon to plead Guilty or Not Guilty to an Indictment for that he the  said Christopher did feloniously abstract and steal from the  dwelling-house and office of one Sampson Brass, gentleman, one Bank  Note for Five Pounds issued by the Governor and Company of the Bank of  England; in contravention of the Statutes in that case made and  provided, and against the peace of our Sovereign Lord the King, his  crown and dignity.
    To this indictment, Christopher Nubbles, in a low and trembling voice,  pleaded Not Guilty; and here, let those who are in the habit of forming  hasty judgments from appearances, and who would have had Christopher,  if innocent, speak out very strong and loud, observe, that confinement  and anxiety will subdue the stoutest hearts; and that to one who has  been close shut up, though it be only for ten or eleven days, seeing  but stone walls and a very few stony faces, the sudden entrance into a  great hall filled with life, is a rather disconcerting and startling  circumstance.
  To this, it must be added, that life in a wig is to a  large class of people much more terrifying and impressive than life  with its own head of hair; and if, in addition to these considerations,  there be taken into account Kit's natural emotion on seeing the two Mr  Garlands and the little Notary looking on with pale and anxious faces,  it will perhaps seem matter of no very great wonder that he should have  been rather out of sorts, and unable to make himself quite at home.
    Although he had never seen either of the Mr Garlands, or Mr Witherden,  since the time of his arrest, he had been given to understand that they  had employed counsel for him.
  Therefore, when one of the gentlemen in  wigs got up and said 'I am for the prisoner, my Lord,' Kit made him a  bow; and when another gentleman in a wig got up and said 'And I'm  against him, my Lord,' Kit trembled very much, and bowed to him too.
  And didn't he hope in his own heart that his gentleman was a match for  the other gentleman, and would make him ashamed of himself in no time!    The gentleman who was against him had to speak first, and being in  dreadfully good spirits (for he had, in the last trial, very nearly  procured the acquittal of a young gentleman who had had the misfortune  to murder his father) he spoke up, you may be sure; telling the jury  that if they acquitted this prisoner they must expect to suffer no less  pangs and agonies than he had told the other jury they would certainly  undergo if they convicted that prisoner.
  And when he had told them all  about the case, and that he had never known a worse case, he stopped a  little while, like a man who had something terrible to tell them, and  then said that he understood an attempt would be made by his learned  friend (and here he looked sideways at Kit's gentleman) to impeach the  testimony of those immaculate witnesses whom he should call before  them; but he did hope and trust that his learned friend would have a  greater respect and veneration for the character of the prosecutor;  than whom, as he well knew, there did not exist, and never had existed,  a more honourable member of that most honourable profession to which he  was attached.
  And then he said, did the jury know Bevis Marks?  And if  they did know Bevis Marks (as he trusted for their own character, they  did) did they know the historical and elevating associations connected  with that most remarkable spot?  Did they believe that a man like Brass  could reside in a place like Bevis Marks, and not be a virtuous and  most upright character?  And when he had said a great deal to them on  this point, he remembered that it was an insult to their understandings  to make any remarks on what they must have felt so strongly without  him, and therefore called Sampson Brass into the witness-box,  straightway.
    Then up comes Mr Brass, very brisk and fresh; and, having bowed to the  judge, like a man who has had the pleasure of seeing him before, and  who hopes he has been pretty well since their last meeting, folds his  arms, and looks at his gentleman as much as to say 'Here I am--full of  evidence--Tap me!'  And the gentleman does tap him presently, and with  great discretion too; drawing off the evidence by little and little,  and making it run quite clear and bright in the eyes of all present.
  Then, Kit's gentleman takes him in hand, but can make nothing of him;  and after a great many very long questions and very short answers, Mr  Sampson Brass goes down in glory.
    To him succeeds Sarah, who in like manner is easy to be managed by Mr  Brass's gentleman, but very obdurate to Kit's.
  In short, Kit's  gentleman can get nothing out of her but a repetition of what she has  said before (only a little stronger this time, as against his client),  and therefore lets her go, in some confusion.
  Then, Mr Brass's  gentleman calls Richard Swiveller, and Richard Swiveller appears  accordingly.
    Now, Mr Brass's gentleman has it whispered in his ear that this witness  is disposed to be friendly to the prisoner--which, to say the truth, he  is rather glad to hear, as his strength is considered to lie in what is  familiarly termed badgering.
  Wherefore, he begins by requesting the  officer to be quite sure that this witness kisses the book, then goes  to work at him, tooth and nail.
    'Mr Swiveller,' says this gentleman to Dick, when he had told his tale  with evident reluctance and a desire to make the best of it: 'Pray sir,  where did you dine yesterday?'--'Where did I dine yesterday?'--'Aye,  sir, where did you dine yesterday--was it near here, sir?'--'Oh to be  sure--yes--just over the way.
'--'To be sure.
  Yes.
  Just over the way,'  repeats Mr Brass's gentleman, with a glance at the court.
--'Alone,  sir?'--'I beg your pardon,' says Mr Swiveller, who has not caught the  question--'Alone, sir?' repeats Mr Brass's gentleman in a voice of  thunder, 'did you dine alone?  Did you treat anybody, sir? Come!'--'Oh  yes, to be sure--yes, I did,' says Mr Swiveller with a smile.
--'Have  the goodness to banish a levity, sir, which is very ill-suited to the  place in which you stand (though perhaps you have reason to be thankful  that it's only that place),' says Mr Brass's gentleman, with a nod of  the head, insinuating that the dock is Mr Swiveller's legitimate sphere  of action; 'and attend to me.
  You were waiting about here, yesterday,  in expectation that this trial was coming on.
  You dined over the way.
  You treated somebody.
  Now, was that somebody brother to the prisoner  at the bar?'--Mr Swiveller is proceeding to explain--'Yes or No, sir,'  cries Mr Brass's gentleman--'But will you allow me--'--'Yes or No,  sir'--'Yes it was, but--'--'Yes it was,' cries the gentleman, taking  him up short.
  'And a very pretty witness YOU are!'    Down sits Mr Brass's gentleman.
  Kit's gentleman, not knowing how the  matter really stands, is afraid to pursue the subject.
  Richard  Swiveller retires abashed.
  Judge, jury and spectators have visions of  his lounging about, with an ill-looking, large-whiskered, dissolute  young fellow of six feet high.
  The reality is, little Jacob, with the  calves of his legs exposed to the open air, and himself tied up in a  shawl.
  Nobody knows the truth; everybody believes a falsehood; and all  because of the ingenuity of Mr Brass's gentleman.
    Then come the witnesses to character, and here Mr Brass's gentleman  shines again.
  It turns out that Mr Garland has had no character with  Kit, no recommendation of him but from his own mother, and that he was  suddenly dismissed by his former master for unknown reasons.
  'Really  Mr Garland,' says Mr Brass's gentleman, 'for a person who has arrived  at your time of life, you are, to say the least of it, singularly  indiscreet, I think.
'  The jury think so too, and find Kit guilty.
  He  is taken off, humbly protesting his innocence.
  The spectators settle  themselves in their places with renewed attention, for there are  several female witnesses to be examined in the next case, and it has  been rumoured that Mr Brass's gentleman will make great fun in  cross-examining them for the prisoner.
    Kit's mother, poor woman, is waiting at the grate below stairs,  accompanied by Barbara's mother (who, honest soul! never does anything  but cry, and hold the baby), and a sad interview ensues.
  The  newspaper-reading turnkey has told them all.
  He don't think it will be  transportation for life, because there's time to prove the good  character yet, and that is sure to serve him.
  He wonders what he did  it for.
  'He never did it!' cries Kit's mother.
  'Well,' says the  turnkey, 'I won't contradict you.
  It's all one, now, whether he did it  or not.
'    Kit's mother can reach his hand through the bars, and she clasps it--  God, and those to whom he has given such tenderness, only know in how  much agony.
  Kit bids her keep a good heart, and, under pretence of  having the children lifted up to kiss him, prays Barbara's mother in a  whisper to take her home.
    'Some friend will rise up for us, mother,' cried Kit, 'I am sure.
  If  not now, before long.
  My innocence will come out, mother, and I shall  be brought back again; I feel confidence in that.
  You must teach  little Jacob and the baby how all this was, for if they thought I had  ever been dishonest, when they grew old enough to understand, it would  break my heart to know it, if I was thousands of miles away.
--Oh! is  there no good gentleman here, who will take care of her!'    The hand slips out of his, for the poor creature sinks down upon the  earth, insensible.
  Richard Swiveller comes hastily up, elbows the  bystanders out of the way, takes her (after some trouble) in one arm  after the manner of theatrical ravishers, and, nodding to Kit, and  commanding Barbara's mother to follow, for he has a coach waiting,  bears her swiftly off.
    Well; Richard took her home.
  And what astonishing absurdities in the  way of quotation from song and poem he perpetrated on the road, no man  knows.
  He took her home, and stayed till she was recovered; and,  having no money to pay the coach, went back in state to Bevis Marks,  bidding the driver (for it was Saturday night) wait at the door while  he went in for 'change.
'    'Mr Richard, sir,' said Brass cheerfully, 'Good evening!'    Monstrous as Kit's tale had appeared, at first, Mr Richard did, that  night, half suspect his affable employer of some deep villany.
  Perhaps  it was but the misery he had just witnessed which gave his careless  nature this impulse; but, be that as it may, it was very strong upon  him, and he said in as few words as possible, what he wanted.
    'Money?' cried Brass, taking out his purse.
  'Ha ha!  To be sure, Mr  Richard, to be sure, sir.
  All men must live.
  You haven't change for a  five-pound note, have you sir?'    'No,' returned Dick, shortly.
    'Oh!' said Brass, 'here's the very sum.
  That saves trouble.
  You're  very welcome I'm sure.
--Mr Richard, sir--'    Dick, who had by this time reached the door, turned round.
    'You needn't,' said Brass, 'trouble yourself to come back any more,  Sir.
'    'Eh?'    'You see, Mr Richard,' said Brass, thrusting his hands in his pockets,  and rocking himself to and fro on his stool, 'the fact is, that a man  of your abilities is lost, Sir, quite lost, in our dry and mouldy line.
  It's terrible drudgery--shocking.
  I should say, now, that the stage,  or the--or the army, Mr Richard--or something very superior in the  licensed victualling way--was the kind of thing that would call out the  genius of such a man as you.
  I hope you'll look in to see us now and  then.
  Sally, Sir, will be delighted I'm sure.
  She's extremely sorry  to lose you, Mr Richard, but a sense of her duty to society reconciles  her.
  An amazing creature that, sir!  You'll find the money quite  correct, I think.
  There's a cracked window sir, but I've not made any  deduction on that account.
  Whenever we part with friends, Mr Richard,  let us part liberally.
  A delightful sentiment, sir!'    To all these rambling observations, Mr Swiveller answered not one word,  but, returning for the aquatic jacket, rolled it into a tight round  ball: looking steadily at Brass meanwhile as if he had some intention  of bowling him down with it.
  He only took it under his arm, however,  and marched out of the office in profound silence.
  When he had closed  the door, he re-opened it, stared in again for a few moments with the  same portentous gravity, and nodding his head once, in a slow and  ghost-like manner, vanished.
    He paid the coachman, and turned his back on Bevis Marks, big with  great designs for the comforting of Kit's mother and the aid of Kit  himself.
    But the lives of gentlemen devoted to such pleasures as Richard  Swiveller, are extremely precarious.
  The spiritual excitement of the  last fortnight, working upon a system affected in no slight degree by  the spirituous excitement of some years, proved a little too much for  him.
  That very night, Mr Richard was seized with an alarming illness,  and in twenty-four hours was stricken with a raging fever.
              Tossing to and fro upon his hot, uneasy bed; tormented by a fierce  thirst which nothing could appease; unable to find, in any change of  posture, a moment's peace or ease; and rambling, ever, through deserts  of thought where there was no resting-place, no sight or sound  suggestive of refreshment or repose, nothing but a dull eternal  weariness, with no change but the restless shiftings of his miserable  body, and the weary wandering of his mind, constant still to one  ever-present anxiety--to a sense of something left undone, of some  fearful obstacle to be surmounted, of some carking care that would not  be driven away, and which haunted the distempered brain, now in this  form, now in that, always shadowy and dim, but recognisable for the  same phantom in every shape it took: darkening every vision like an  evil conscience, and making slumber horrible--in these slow tortures  of his dread disease, the unfortunate Richard lay wasting and consuming  inch by inch, until, at last, when he seemed to fight and struggle to  rise up, and to be held down by devils, he sank into a deep sleep, and  dreamed no more.
    He awoke.
  With a sensation of most blissful rest, better than sleep  itself, he began gradually to remember something of these sufferings,  and to think what a long night it had been, and whether he had not been  delirious twice or thrice.
  Happening, in the midst of these  cogitations, to raise his hand, he was astonished to find how heavy it  seemed, and yet how thin and light it really was.
  Still, he felt  indifferent and happy; and having no curiosity to pursue the subject,  remained in the same waking slumber until his attention was attracted  by a cough.
  This made him doubt whether he had locked his door last  night, and feel a little surprised at having a companion in the room.
  Still, he lacked energy to follow up this train of thought; and  unconsciously fell, in a luxury of repose, to staring at some green  stripes on the bed-furniture, and associating them strangely with  patches of fresh turf, while the yellow ground between made  gravel-walks, and so helped out a long perspective of trim gardens.
    He was rambling in imagination on these terraces, and had quite lost  himself among them indeed, when he heard the cough once more.
  The  walks shrunk into stripes again at the sound, and raising himself a  little in the bed, and holding the curtain open with one hand, he  looked out.
    The same room certainly, and still by candlelight; but with what  unbounded astonishment did he see all those bottles, and basins, and  articles of linen airing by the fire, and such-like furniture of a sick  chamber--all very clean and neat, but all quite different from anything  he had left there, when he went to bed!  The atmosphere, too, filled  with a cool smell of herbs and vinegar; the floor newly sprinkled;  the--the what?  The Marchioness?    Yes; playing cribbage with herself at the table.
  There she sat, intent  upon her game, coughing now and then in a subdued manner as if she  feared to disturb him--shuffling the cards, cutting, dealing, playing,  counting, pegging--going through all the mysteries of cribbage as if  she had been in full practice from her cradle!  Mr Swiveller  contemplated these things for a short time, and suffering the curtain  to fall into its former position, laid his head on the pillow again.
    'I'm dreaming,' thought Richard, 'that's clear.
  When I went to bed, my  hands were not made of egg-shells; and now I can almost see through  'em.
  If this is not a dream, I have woke up, by mistake, in an Arabian  Night, instead of a London one.
  But I have no doubt I'm asleep.
  Not  the least.
'    Here the small servant had another cough.
    'Very remarkable!' thought Mr Swiveller.
  'I never dreamt such a real  cough as that before.
  I don't know, indeed, that I ever dreamt either  a cough or a sneeze.
  Perhaps it's part of the philosophy of dreams  that one never does.
  There's another--and another--I say!--I'm  dreaming rather fast!'    For the purpose of testing his real condition, Mr Swiveller, after some  reflection, pinched himself in the arm.
    'Queerer still!' he thought.
  'I came to bed rather plump than  otherwise, and now there's nothing to lay hold of.
  I'll take another  survey.
'    The result of this additional inspection was, to convince Mr Swiveller  that the objects by which he was surrounded were real, and that he saw  them, beyond all question, with his waking eyes.
    'It's an Arabian Night; that's what it is,' said Richard.
  'I'm in  Damascus or Grand Cairo.
  The Marchioness is a Genie, and having had a  wager with another Genie about who is the handsomest young man alive,  and the worthiest to be the husband of the Princess of China, has  brought me away, room and all, to compare us together.
  Perhaps,' said  Mr Swiveller, turning languidly round on his pillow, and looking on  that side of his bed which was next the wall, 'the Princess may be  still--No, she's gone.
'    Not feeling quite satisfied with this explanation, as, even taking it  to be the correct one, it still involved a little mystery and doubt, Mr  Swiveller raised the curtain again, determined to take the first  favourable opportunity of addressing his companion.
  An occasion  presented itself.
  The Marchioness dealt, turned up a knave, and  omitted to take the usual advantage; upon which Mr Swiveller called out  as loud as he could--'Two for his heels!'    The Marchioness jumped up quickly and clapped her hands.
  'Arabian  Night, certainly,' thought Mr Swiveller; 'they always clap their hands  instead of ringing the bell.
  Now for the two thousand black slaves,  with jars of jewels on their heads!'    It appeared, however, that she had only clapped her hands for joy; for  directly afterward she began to laugh, and then to cry; declaring, not  in choice Arabic but in familiar English, that she was 'so glad, she  didn't know what to do.
'    'Marchioness,' said Mr Swiveller, thoughtfully, 'be pleased to draw  nearer.
  First of all, will you have the goodness to inform me where I  shall find my voice; and secondly, what has become of my flesh?'    The Marchioness only shook her head mournfully, and cried again;  whereupon Mr Swiveller (being very weak) felt his own eyes affected  likewise.
    'I begin to infer, from your manner, and these appearances,  Marchioness,' said Richard after a pause, and smiling with a trembling  lip, 'that I have been ill.
'    'You just have!' replied the small servant, wiping her eyes.
  'And  haven't you been a talking nonsense!'    'Oh!' said Dick.
  'Very ill, Marchioness, have I been?'    'Dead, all but,' replied the small servant.
  'I never thought you'd get  better.
  Thank Heaven you have!'    Mr Swiveller was silent for a long while.
  By and bye, he began to talk  again, inquiring how long he had been there.
    'Three weeks to-morrow,' replied the servant.
    'Three what?' said Dick.
    'Weeks,' returned the Marchioness emphatically; 'three long, slow  weeks.
'    The bare thought of having been in such extremity, caused Richard to  fall into another silence, and to lie flat down again, at his full  length.
  The Marchioness, having arranged the bed-clothes more  comfortably, and felt that his hands and forehead were quite cool--a  discovery that filled her with delight--cried a little more, and then  applied herself to getting tea ready, and making some thin dry toast.
    While she was thus engaged, Mr Swiveller looked on with a grateful  heart, very much astonished to see how thoroughly at home she made  herself, and attributing this attention, in its origin, to Sally Brass,  whom, in his own mind, he could not thank enough.
  When the Marchioness  had finished her toasting, she spread a clean cloth on a tray, and  brought him some crisp slices and a great basin of weak tea, with which  (she said) the doctor had left word he might refresh himself when he  awoke.
  She propped him up with pillows, if not as skilfully as if she  had been a professional nurse all her life, at least as tenderly; and  looked on with unutterable satisfaction while the patient--stopping  every now and then to shake her by the hand--took his poor meal with an  appetite and relish, which the greatest dainties of the earth, under  any other circumstances, would have failed to provoke.
  Having cleared  away, and disposed everything comfortably about him again, she sat down  at the table to take her own tea.
    'Marchioness,' said Mr Swiveller, 'how's Sally?'    The small servant screwed her face into an expression of the very  uttermost entanglement of slyness, and shook her head.
    'What, haven't you seen her lately?' said Dick.
    'Seen her!' cried the small servant.
  'Bless you, I've run away!'    Mr Swiveller immediately laid himself down again quite flat, and so  remained for about five minutes.
  By slow degrees he resumed his  sitting posture after that lapse of time, and inquired:    'And where do you live, Marchioness?'    'Live!' cried the small servant.
  'Here!'    'Oh!' said Mr Swiveller.
    And with that he fell down flat again, as suddenly as if he had been  shot.
  Thus he remained, motionless and bereft of speech, until she had  finished her meal, put everything in its place, and swept the hearth;  when he motioned her to bring a chair to the bedside, and, being  propped up again, opened a farther conversation.
    'And so,' said Dick, 'you have run away?'    'Yes,' said the Marchioness, 'and they've been a tizing of me.
'    'Been--I beg your pardon,' said Dick--'what have they been doing?'    'Been a tizing of me--tizing you know--in the newspapers,' rejoined the  Marchioness.
    'Aye, aye,' said Dick, 'advertising?'    The small servant nodded, and winked.
  Her eyes were so red with waking  and crying, that the Tragic Muse might have winked with greater  consistency.
  And so Dick felt.
    'Tell me,' said he, 'how it was that you thought of coming here.
'    'Why, you see,' returned the Marchioness, 'when you was gone, I hadn't  any friend at all, because the lodger he never come back, and I didn't  know where either him or you was to be found, you know.
  But one  morning, when I was--'    'Was near a keyhole?' suggested Mr Swiveller, observing that she  faltered.
    'Well then,' said the small servant, nodding; 'when I was near the  office keyhole--as you see me through, you know--I heard somebody  saying that she lived here, and was the lady whose house you lodged at,  and that you was took very bad, and wouldn't nobody come and take care  of you.
  Mr Brass, he says, "It's no business of mine," he says; and  Miss Sally, she says, "He's a funny chap, but it's no business of  mine;" and the lady went away, and slammed the door to, when she went  out, I can tell you.
  So I run away that night, and come here, and told  'em you was my brother, and they believed me, and I've been here ever  since.
'    'This poor little Marchioness has been wearing herself to death!' cried  Dick.
    'No I haven't,' she returned, 'not a bit of it.
  Don't you mind about  me.
  I like sitting up, and I've often had a sleep, bless you, in one  of them chairs.
  But if you could have seen how you tried to jump out  o' winder, and if you could have heard how you used to keep on singing  and making speeches, you wouldn't have believed it--I'm so glad you're  better, Mr Liverer.
'    'Liverer indeed!' said Dick thoughtfully.
  'It's well I am a liverer.
  I strongly suspect I should have died, Marchioness, but for you.
'    At this point, Mr Swiveller took the small servant's hand in his again,  and being, as we have seen, but poorly, might in struggling to express  his thanks have made his eyes as red as hers, but that she quickly  changed the theme by making him lie down, and urging him to keep very  quiet.
    'The doctor,' she told him, 'said you was to be kept quite still, and  there was to be no noise nor nothing.
  Now, take a rest, and then we'll  talk again.
  I'll sit by you, you know.
  If you shut your eyes, perhaps  you'll go to sleep.
  You'll be all the better for it, if you do.
'    The Marchioness, in saying these words, brought a little table to the  bedside, took her seat at it, and began to work away at the concoction  of some cooling drink, with the address of a score of chemists.
  Richard Swiveller being indeed fatigued, fell into a slumber, and  waking in about half an hour, inquired what time it was.
    'Just gone half after six,' replied his small friend, helping him to  sit up again.
    'Marchioness,' said Richard, passing his hand over his forehead and  turning suddenly round, as though the subject but that moment flashed  upon him, 'what has become of Kit?'    He had been sentenced to transportation for a great many years, she  said.
    'Has he gone?' asked Dick--'his mother--how is she,--what has become of  her?'    His nurse shook her head, and answered that she knew nothing about  them.
  'But, if I thought,' said she, very slowly, 'that you'd keep  quiet, and not put yourself into another fever, I could tell you--but  I won't now.
'    'Yes, do,' said Dick.
  'It will amuse me.
'    'Oh! would it though!' rejoined the small servant, with a horrified  look.
  'I know better than that.
  Wait till you're better and then I'll  tell you.
'      Dick looked very earnestly at his little friend: and his eyes, being  large and hollow from illness, assisted the expression so much, that  she was quite frightened, and besought him not to think any more about  it.
  What had already fallen from her, however, had not only piqued his  curiosity, but seriously alarmed him, wherefore he urged her to tell  him the worst at once.
    'Oh there's no worst in it,' said the small servant.
  'It hasn't  anything to do with you.
'    'Has it anything to do with--is it anything you heard through chinks or  keyholes--and that you were not intended to hear?' asked Dick, in a  breathless state.
    'Yes,' replied the small servant.
    'In--in Bevis Marks?' pursued Dick hastily.
  'Conversations between  Brass and Sally?'    'Yes,' cried the small servant again.
    Richard Swiveller thrust his lank arm out of bed, and, gripping her by  the wrist and drawing her close to him, bade her out with it, and  freely too, or he would not answer for the consequences; being wholly  unable to endure the state of excitement and expectation.
  She, seeing  that he was greatly agitated, and that the effects of postponing her  revelation might be much more injurious than any that were likely to  ensue from its being made at once, promised compliance, on condition  that the patient kept himself perfectly quiet, and abstained from  starting up or tossing about.
    'But if you begin to do that,' said the small servant, 'I'll leave off.
  And so I tell you.
'    'You can't leave off, till you have gone on,' said Dick.
  'And do go  on, there's a darling.
  Speak, sister, speak.
  Pretty Polly say.
  Oh  tell me when, and tell me where, pray Marchioness, I beseech you!'    Unable to resist these fervent adjurations, which Richard Swiveller  poured out as passionately as if they had been of the most solemn and  tremendous nature, his companion spoke thus:    'Well!  Before I run away, I used to sleep in the kitchen--where we  played cards, you know.
  Miss Sally used to keep the key of the kitchen  door in her pocket, and she always come down at night to take away the  candle and rake out the fire.
  When she had done that, she left me to  go to bed in the dark, locked the door on the outside, put the key in  her pocket again, and kept me locked up till she come down in the  morning--very early I can tell you--and let me out.
  I was terrible  afraid of being kept like this, because if there was a fire, I thought  they might forget me and only take care of themselves you know.
  So,  whenever I see an old rusty key anywhere, I picked it up and tried if  it would fit the door, and at last I found in the dust cellar a key  that did fit it.
'    Here, Mr Swiveller made a violent demonstration with his legs.
  But the  small servant immediately pausing in her talk, he subsided again, and  pleading a momentary forgetfulness of their compact, entreated her to  proceed.
    'They kept me very short,' said the small servant.
  'Oh! you can't  think how short they kept me!  So I used to come out at night after  they'd gone to bed, and feel about in the dark for bits of biscuit, or  sangwitches that you'd left in the office, or even pieces of orange  peel to put into cold water and make believe it was wine.
  Did you ever  taste orange peel and water?'    Mr Swiveller replied that he had never tasted that ardent liquor; and  once more urged his friend to resume the thread of her narrative.
    'If you make believe very much, it's quite nice,' said the small  servant, 'but if you don't, you know, it seems as if it would bear a  little more seasoning, certainly.
  Well, sometimes I used to come out  after they'd gone to bed, and sometimes before, you know; and one or  two nights before there was all that precious noise in the office--when  the young man was took, I mean--I come upstairs while Mr Brass and Miss  Sally was a-sittin' at the office fire; and I tell you the truth, that  I come to listen again, about the key of the safe.
'    Mr Swiveller gathered up his knees so as to make a great cone of the  bedclothes, and conveyed into his countenance an expression of the  utmost concern.
  But the small servant pausing, and holding up her  finger, the cone gently disappeared, though the look of concern did not.
    'There was him and her,' said the small servant, 'a-sittin' by the  fire, and talking softly together.
  Mr Brass says to Miss Sally, "Upon  my word," he says "it's a dangerous thing, and it might get us into a  world of trouble, and I don't half like it.
" She says--you know her  way--she says, "You're the chickenest-hearted, feeblest, faintest man I  ever see, and I think," she says, "that I ought to have been the  brother, and you the sister.
  Isn't Quilp," she says, "our principal  support?" "He certainly is," says Mr Brass, "And an't we," she says,  "constantly ruining somebody or other in the way of business?" "We  certainly are," says Mr Brass.
  "Then does it signify," she says,  "about ruining this Kit when Quilp desires it?" "It certainly does not  signify," says Mr Brass.
  Then they whispered and laughed for a long  time about there being no danger if it was well done, and then Mr Brass  pulls out his pocket-book, and says, "Well," he says, "here it  is--Quilp's own five-pound note.
  We'll agree that way, then," he says.
  "Kit's coming to-morrow morning, I know.
  While he's up-stairs, you'll  get out of the way, and I'll clear off Mr Richard.
  Having Kit alone,  I'll hold him in conversation, and put this property in his hat.
  I'll  manage so, besides," he says, "that Mr Richard shall find it there, and  be the evidence.
  And if that don't get Christopher out of Mr Quilp's  way, and satisfy Mr Quilp's grudges," he says, "the Devil's in it.
"  Miss Sally laughed, and said that was the plan, and as they seemed to  be moving away, and I was afraid to stop any longer, I went down-stairs  again.
--There!'    The small servant had gradually worked herself into as much agitation  as Mr Swiveller, and therefore made no effort to restrain him when he  sat up in bed and hastily demanded whether this story had been told to  anybody.
    'How could it be?' replied his nurse.
  'I was almost afraid to think  about it, and hoped the young man would be let off.
  When I heard 'em  say they had found him guilty of what he didn't do, you was gone, and  so was the lodger--though I think I should have been frightened to tell  him, even if he'd been there.
  Ever since I come here, you've been out  of your senses, and what would have been the good of telling you then?'    'Marchioness,' said Mr Swiveller, plucking off his nightcap and  flinging it to the other end of the room; 'if you'll do me the favour  to retire for a few minutes and see what sort of a night it is, I'll  get up.
'    'You mustn't think of such a thing,' cried his nurse.
    'I must indeed,' said the patient, looking round the room.
  'Whereabouts are my clothes?'    'Oh, I'm so glad--you haven't got any,' replied the Marchioness.
    'Ma'am!' said Mr Swiveller, in great astonishment.
    'I've been obliged to sell them, every one, to get the things that was  ordered for you.
  But don't take on about that,' urged the Marchioness,  as Dick fell back upon his pillow.
  'You're too weak to stand, indeed.
'    'I am afraid,' said Richard dolefully, 'that you're right.
  What ought  I to do! what is to be done!'    It naturally occurred to him on very little reflection, that the first  step to take would be to communicate with one of the Mr Garlands  instantly.
  It was very possible that Mr Abel had not yet left the  office.
  In as little time as it takes to tell it, the small servant  had the address in pencil on a piece of paper; a verbal description of  father and son, which would enable her to recognise either, without  difficulty; and a special caution to be shy of Mr Chuckster, in  consequence of that gentleman's known antipathy to Kit.
  Armed with  these slender powers, she hurried away, commissioned to bring either  old Mr Garland or Mr Abel, bodily, to that apartment.
    'I suppose,' said Dick, as she closed the door slowly, and peeped into  the room again, to make sure that he was comfortable, 'I suppose  there's nothing left--not so much as a waistcoat even?'    'No, nothing.
'    'It's embarrassing,' said Mr Swiveller, 'in case of fire--even an  umbrella would be something--but you did quite right, dear Marchioness.
  I should have died without you!'              It was well for the small servant that she was of a sharp, quick  nature, or the consequence of sending her out alone, from the very  neighbourhood in which it was most dangerous for her to appear, would  probably have been the restoration of Miss Sally Brass to the supreme  authority over her person.
  Not unmindful of the risk she ran, however,  the Marchioness no sooner left the house than she dived into the first  dark by-way that presented itself, and, without any present reference  to the point to which her journey tended, made it her first business to  put two good miles of brick and mortar between herself and Bevis Marks.
    When she had accomplished this object, she began to shape her course  for the notary's office, to which--shrewdly inquiring of apple-women  and oyster-sellers at street-corners, rather than in lighted shops or  of well-dressed people, at the hazard of attracting notice--she easily  procured a direction.
  As carrier-pigeons, on being first let loose in  a strange place, beat the air at random for a short time before darting  off towards the spot for which they are designed, so did the  Marchioness flutter round and round until she believed herself in  safety, and then bear swiftly down upon the port for which she was  bound.
    She had no bonnet--nothing on her head but a great cap which, in some  old time, had been worn by Sally Brass, whose taste in head-dresses  was, as we have seen, peculiar--and her speed was rather retarded than  assisted by her shoes, which, being extremely large and slipshod, flew  off every now and then, and were difficult to find again, among the  crowd of passengers.
  Indeed, the poor little creature experienced so  much trouble and delay from having to grope for these articles of dress  in mud and kennel, and suffered in these researches so much jostling,  pushing, squeezing and bandying from hand to hand, that by the time she  reached the street in which the notary lived, she was fairly worn out  and exhausted, and could not refrain from tears.
    But to have got there at last was a great comfort, especially as there  were lights still burning in the office window, and therefore some hope  that she was not too late.
  So the Marchioness dried her eyes with the  backs of her hands, and, stealing softly up the steps, peeped in  through the glass door.
    Mr Chuckster was standing behind the lid of his desk, making such  preparations towards finishing off for the night, as pulling down his  wristbands and pulling up his shirt-collar, settling his neck more  gracefully in his stock, and secretly arranging his whiskers by the aid  of a little triangular bit of looking glass.
  Before the ashes of the  fire stood two gentlemen, one of whom she rightly judged to be the  notary, and the other (who was buttoning his great-coat and was  evidently about to depart immediately) Mr Abel Garland.
    Having made these observations, the small spy took counsel with  herself, and resolved to wait in the street until Mr Abel came out, as  there would be then no fear of having to speak before Mr Chuckster, and  less difficulty in delivering her message.
  With this purpose she  slipped out again, and crossing the road, sat down upon a door-step  just opposite.
    She had hardly taken this position, when there came dancing up the  street, with his legs all wrong, and his head everywhere by turns, a  pony.
  This pony had a little phaeton behind him, and a man in it; but  neither man nor phaeton seemed to embarrass him in the least, as he  reared up on his hind legs, or stopped, or went on, or stood still  again, or backed, or went side-ways, without the smallest reference to  them--just as the fancy seized him, and as if he were the freest animal  in creation.
  When they came to the notary's door, the man called out  in a very respectful manner, 'Woa then'--intimating that if he might  venture to express a wish, it would be that they stopped there.
  The  pony made a moment's pause; but, as if it occurred to him that to stop  when he was required might be to establish an inconvenient and  dangerous precedent, he immediately started off again, rattled at a  fast trot to the street corner, wheeled round, came back, and then  stopped of his own accord.
    'Oh! you're a precious creatur!' said the man--who didn't venture by  the bye to come out in his true colours until he was safe on the  pavement.
  'I wish I had the rewarding of you--I do.
'    'What has he been doing?' said Mr Abel, tying a shawl round his neck as  he came down the steps.
    'He's enough to fret a man's heart out,' replied the hostler.
  'He is  the most wicious rascal--Woa then, will you?'    'He'll never stand still, if you call him names,' said Mr Abel, getting  in, and taking the reins.
  'He's a very good fellow if you know how to  manage him.
  This is the first time he has been out, this long while,  for he has lost his old driver and wouldn't stir for anybody else, till  this morning.
  The lamps are right, are they?  That's well.
  Be here to  take him to-morrow, if you please.
  Good night!'    And, after one or two strange plunges, quite of his own invention, the  pony yielded to Mr Abel's mildness, and trotted gently off.
    All this time Mr Chuckster had been standing at the door, and the small  servant had been afraid to approach.
  She had nothing for it now,  therefore, but to run after the chaise, and to call to Mr Abel to stop.
  Being out of breath when she came up with it, she was unable to make  him hear.
  The case was desperate; for the pony was quickening his  pace.
  The Marchioness hung on behind for a few moments, and, feeling  that she could go no farther, and must soon yield, clambered by a  vigorous effort into the hinder seat, and in so doing lost one of the  shoes for ever.
    Mr Abel being in a thoughtful frame of mind, and having quite enough to  do to keep the pony going, went jogging on without looking round:  little dreaming of the strange figure that was close behind him, until  the Marchioness, having in some degree recovered her breath, and the  loss of her shoe, and the novelty of her position, uttered close into  his ear, the words--'I say, Sir'--    He turned his head quickly enough then, and stopping the pony, cried,  with some trepidation, 'God bless me, what is this!'    'Don't be frightened, Sir,' replied the still panting messenger.
  'Oh  I've run such a way after you!'    'What do you want with me?' said Mr Abel.
  'How did you come here?'    'I got in behind,' replied the Marchioness.
  'Oh please drive on,  sir--don't stop--and go towards the City, will you?  And oh do please  make haste, because it's of consequence.
  There's somebody wants to see  you there.
  He sent me to say would you come directly, and that he  knowed all about Kit, and could save him yet, and prove his innocence.
'    'What do you tell me, child?'    'The truth, upon my word and honour I do.
  But please to drive on--  quick, please!  I've been such a time gone, he'll think I'm lost.
'    Mr Abel involuntarily urged the pony forward.
  The pony, impelled by  some secret sympathy or some new caprice, burst into a great pace, and  neither slackened it, nor indulged in any eccentric performances, until  they arrived at the door of Mr Swiveller's lodging, where, marvellous  to relate, he consented to stop when Mr Abel checked him.
    'See!  It's the room up there,' said the Marchioness, pointing to one  where there was a faint light.
  'Come!'    Mr Abel, who was one of the simplest and most retiring creatures in  existence, and naturally timid withal, hesitated; for he had heard of  people being decoyed into strange places to be robbed and murdered,  under circumstances very like the present, and, for anything he knew to  the contrary, by guides very like the Marchioness.
  His regard for Kit,  however, overcame every other consideration.
  So, entrusting Whisker to  the charge of a man who was lingering hard by in expectation of the  job, he suffered his companion to take his hand, and to lead him up the  dark and narrow stairs.
    He was not a little surprised to find himself conducted into a  dimly-lighted sick chamber, where a man was sleeping tranquilly in bed.
    'An't it nice to see him lying there so quiet?' said his guide, in an  earnest whisper.
  'Oh! you'd say it was, if you had only seen him two  or three days ago.
'    Mr Abel made no answer, and, to say the truth, kept a long way from the  bed and very near the door.
  His guide, who appeared to understand his  reluctance, trimmed the candle, and taking it in her hand, approached  the bed.
  As she did so, the sleeper started up, and he recognised in  the wasted face the features of Richard Swiveller.
    'Why, how is this?' said Mr Abel kindly, as he hurried towards him.
  'You have been ill?'    'Very,' replied Dick.
  'Nearly dead.
  You might have chanced to hear of  your Richard on his bier, but for the friend I sent to fetch you.
  Another shake of the hand, Marchioness, if you please.
  Sit down, Sir.
'    Mr Abel seemed rather astonished to hear of the quality of his guide,  and took a chair by the bedside.
    'I have sent for you, Sir,' said Dick--'but she told you on what  account?'    'She did.
  I am quite bewildered by all this.
  I really don't know what  to say or think,' replied Mr Abel.
    'You'll say that presently,' retorted Dick.
  'Marchioness, take a seat  on the bed, will you?  Now, tell this gentleman all that you told me;  and be particular.
  Don't you speak another word, Sir.
'    The story was repeated; it was, in effect, exactly the same as before,  without any deviation or omission.
  Richard Swiveller kept his eyes  fixed on his visitor during its narration, and directly it was  concluded, took the word again.
    'You have heard it all, and you'll not forget it.
  I'm too giddy and  too queer to suggest anything; but you and your friends will know what  to do.
  After this long delay, every minute is an age.
  If ever you  went home fast in your life, go home fast to-night.
  Don't stop to say  one word to me, but go.
  She will be found here, whenever she's wanted;  and as to me, you're pretty sure to find me at home, for a week or two.
  There are more reasons than one for that.
  Marchioness, a light!  If  you lose another minute in looking at me, sir, I'll never forgive you!'    Mr Abel needed no more remonstrance or persuasion.
  He was gone in an  instant; and the Marchioness, returning from lighting him down-stairs,  reported that the pony, without any preliminary objection whatever, had  dashed away at full gallop.
    'That's right!' said Dick; 'and hearty of him; and I honour him from  this time.
  But get some supper and a mug of beer, for I am sure you  must be tired.
  Do have a mug of beer.
  It will do me as much good to  see you take it as if I might drink it myself.
'    Nothing but this assurance could have prevailed upon the small nurse to  indulge in such a luxury.
  Having eaten and drunk to Mr Swiveller's  extreme contentment, given him his drink, and put everything in neat  order, she wrapped herself in an old coverlet and lay down upon the rug  before the fire.
    Mr Swiveller was by that time murmuring in his sleep, 'Strew then, oh  strew, a bed of rushes.
  Here will we stay, till morning blushes.
  Good  night, Marchioness!'              On awaking in the morning, Richard Swiveller became conscious, by slow  degrees, of whispering voices in his room.
  Looking out between the  curtains, he espied Mr Garland, Mr Abel, the notary, and the single  gentleman, gathered round the Marchioness, and talking to her with  great earnestness but in very subdued tones--fearing, no doubt, to  disturb him.
  He lost no time in letting them know that this precaution  was unnecessary, and all four gentlemen directly approached his  bedside.
  Old Mr Garland was the first to stretch out his hand, and  inquire how he felt.
    Dick was about to answer that he felt much better, though still as weak  as need be, when his little nurse, pushing the visitors aside and  pressing up to his pillow as if in jealousy of their interference, set  his breakfast before him, and insisted on his taking it before he  underwent the fatigue of speaking or of being spoken to.
  Mr Swiveller,  who was perfectly ravenous, and had had, all night, amazingly distinct  and consistent dreams of mutton chops, double stout, and similar  delicacies, felt even the weak tea and dry toast such irresistible  temptations, that he consented to eat and drink on one condition.
    'And that is,' said Dick, returning the pressure of Mr Garland's hand,  'that you answer me this question truly, before I take a bit or drop.
  Is it too late?'    'For completing the work you began so well last night?' returned the  old gentleman.
  'No.
  Set your mind at rest on that point.
  It is not,  I assure you.
'    Comforted by this intelligence, the patient applied himself to his food  with a keen appetite, though evidently not with a greater zest in the  eating than his nurse appeared to have in seeing him eat.
  The manner  of this meal was this:--Mr Swiveller, holding the slice of toast or cup  of tea in his left hand, and taking a bite or drink, as the case might  be, constantly kept, in his right, one palm of the Marchioness tight  locked; and to shake, or even to kiss this imprisoned hand, he would  stop every now and then, in the very act of swallowing, with perfect  seriousness of intention, and the utmost gravity.
  As often as he put  anything into his mouth, whether for eating or drinking, the face of  the Marchioness lighted up beyond all description; but whenever he gave  her one or other of these tokens of recognition, her countenance became  overshadowed, and she began to sob.
  Now, whether she was in her  laughing joy, or in her crying one, the Marchioness could not help  turning to the visitors with an appealing look, which seemed to say,  'You see this fellow--can I help this?'--and they, being thus made, as  it were, parties to the scene, as regularly answered by another look,  'No.
  Certainly not.
'  This dumb-show, taking place during the whole  time of the invalid's breakfast, and the invalid himself, pale and  emaciated, performing no small part in the same, it may be fairly  questioned whether at any meal, where no word, good or bad, was spoken  from beginning to end, so much was expressed by gestures in themselves  so slight and unimportant.
    At length--and to say the truth before very long--Mr Swiveller had  despatched as much toast and tea as in that stage of his recovery it  was discreet to let him have.
  But the cares of the Marchioness did not  stop here; for, disappearing for an instant and presently returning  with a basin of fair water, she laved his face and hands, brushed his  hair, and in short made him as spruce and smart as anybody under such  circumstances could be made; and all this, in as brisk and  business-like a manner, as if he were a very little boy, and she his  grown-up nurse.
  To these various attentions, Mr Swiveller submitted in  a kind of grateful astonishment beyond the reach of language.
  When  they were at last brought to an end, and the Marchioness had withdrawn  into a distant corner to take her own poor breakfast (cold enough by  that time), he turned his face away for some few moments, and shook  hands heartily with the air.
    'Gentlemen,' said Dick, rousing himself from this pause, and turning  round again, 'you'll excuse me.
  Men who have been brought so low as I  have been, are easily fatigued.
  I am fresh again now, and fit for  talking.
  We're short of chairs here, among other trifles, but if  you'll do me the favour to sit upon the bed--'    'What can we do for you?' said Mr Garland, kindly.
    'If you could make the Marchioness yonder, a Marchioness, in real,  sober earnest,' returned Dick, 'I'd thank you to get it done off-hand.
  But as you can't, and as the question is not what you will do for me,  but what you will do for somebody else who has a better claim upon you,  pray sir let me know what you intend doing.
'    'It's chiefly on that account that we have come just now,' said the  single gentleman, 'for you will have another visitor presently.
  We  feared you would be anxious unless you knew from ourselves what steps  we intended to take, and therefore came to you before we stirred in the  matter.
'    'Gentlemen,' returned Dick, 'I thank you.
  Anybody in the helpless  state that you see me in, is naturally anxious.
  Don't let me interrupt  you, sir.
'    'Then, you see, my good fellow,' said the single gentleman, 'that while  we have no doubt whatever of the truth of this disclosure, which has so  providentially come to light--'    'Meaning hers?' said Dick, pointing towards the Marchioness.
    '--Meaning hers, of course.
  While we have no doubt of that, or that a  proper use of it would procure the poor lad's immediate pardon and  liberation, we have a great doubt whether it would, by itself, enable  us to reach Quilp, the chief agent in this villany.
  I should tell you  that this doubt has been confirmed into something very nearly  approaching certainty by the best opinions we have been enabled, in  this short space of time, to take upon the subject.
  You'll agree with  us, that to give him even the most distant chance of escape, if we  could help it, would be monstrous.
  You say with us, no doubt, if  somebody must escape, let it be any one but he.
'    'Yes,' returned Dick, 'certainly.
  That is if somebody must--but upon  my word, I'm unwilling that anybody should.
  Since laws were made for  every degree, to curb vice in others as well as in me--and so forth  you know--doesn't it strike you in that light?'    The single gentleman smiled as if the light in which Mr Swiveller had  put the question were not the clearest in the world, and proceeded to  explain that they contemplated proceeding by stratagem in the first  instance; and that their design was to endeavour to extort a confession  from the gentle Sarah.
    'When she finds how much we know, and how we know it,' he said, 'and  that she is clearly compromised already, we are not without strong  hopes that we may be enabled through her means to punish the other two  effectually.
  If we could do that, she might go scot-free for aught I  cared.
'    Dick received this project in anything but a gracious manner,  representing with as much warmth as he was then capable of showing,  that they would find the old buck (meaning Sarah) more difficult to  manage than Quilp himself--that, for any tampering, terrifying, or  cajolery, she was a very unpromising and unyielding subject--that she  was of a kind of brass not easily melted or moulded into shape--in  short, that they were no match for her, and would be signally defeated.
  But it was in vain to urge them to adopt some other course.
  The single  gentleman has been described as explaining their joint intentions, but  it should have been written that they all spoke together; that if any  one of them by chance held his peace for a moment, he stood gasping and  panting for an opportunity to strike in again: in a word, that they had  reached that pitch of impatience and anxiety where men can neither be  persuaded nor reasoned with; and that it would have been as easy to  turn the most impetuous wind that ever blew, as to prevail on them to  reconsider their determination.
  So, after telling Mr Swiveller how  they had not lost sight of Kit's mother and the children; how they had  never once even lost sight of Kit himself, but had been unremitting in  their endeavours to procure a mitigation of his sentence; how they had  been perfectly distracted between the strong proofs of his guilt, and  their own fading hopes of his innocence; and how he, Richard Swiveller,  might keep his mind at rest, for everything should be happily adjusted  between that time and night;--after telling him all this, and adding a  great many kind and cordial expressions, personal to himself, which it  is unnecessary to recite, Mr Garland, the notary, and the single  gentleman, took their leaves at a very critical time, or Richard  Swiveller must assuredly have been driven into another fever, whereof  the results might have been fatal.
    Mr Abel remained behind, very often looking at his watch and at the  room door, until Mr Swiveller was roused from a short nap, by the  setting-down on the landing-place outside, as from the shoulders of a  porter, of some giant load, which seemed to shake the house, and made  the little physic bottles on the mantel-shelf ring again.
  Directly  this sound reached his ears, Mr Abel started up, and hobbled to the  door, and opened it; and behold! there stood a strong man, with a  mighty hamper, which, being hauled into the room and presently  unpacked, disgorged such treasures as tea, and coffee, and wine, and  rusks, and oranges, and grapes, and fowls ready trussed for boiling,  and calves'-foot jelly, and arrow-root, and sago, and other delicate  restoratives, that the small servant, who had never thought it possible  that such things could be, except in shops, stood rooted to the spot in  her one shoe, with her mouth and eyes watering in unison, and her power  of speech quite gone.
  But, not so Mr Abel; or the strong man who  emptied the hamper, big as it was, in a twinkling; and not so the nice  old lady, who appeared so suddenly that she might have come out of the  hamper too (it was quite large enough), and who, bustling about on  tiptoe and without noise--now here, now there, now everywhere at  once--began to fill out the jelly in tea-cups, and to make chicken  broth in small saucepans, and to peel oranges for the sick man and to  cut them up in little pieces, and to ply the small servant with glasses  of wine and choice bits of everything until more substantial meat could  be prepared for her refreshment.
  The whole of which appearances were  so unexpected and bewildering, that Mr Swiveller, when he had taken two  oranges and a little jelly, and had seen the strong man walk off with  the empty basket, plainly leaving all that abundance for his use and  benefit, was fain to lie down and fall asleep again, from sheer  inability to entertain such wonders in his mind.
    Meanwhile, the single gentleman, the Notary, and Mr Garland, repaired  to a certain coffee-house, and from that place indited and sent a  letter to Miss Sally Brass, requesting her, in terms mysterious and  brief, to favour an unknown friend who wished to consult her, with her  company there, as speedily as possible.
  The communication performed  its errand so well, that within ten minutes of the messenger's return  and report of its delivery, Miss Brass herself was announced.
    'Pray ma'am,' said the single gentleman, whom she found alone in the  room, 'take a chair.
'    Miss Brass sat herself down, in a very stiff and frigid state, and  seemed--as indeed she was--not a little astonished to find that the  lodger and her mysterious correspondent were one and the same person.
    'You did not expect to see me?' said the single gentleman.
    'I didn't think much about it,' returned the beauty.
  'I supposed it  was business of some kind or other.
  If it's about the apartments, of  course you'll give my brother regular notice, you know--or money.
  That's very easily settled.
  You're a responsible party, and in such a  case lawful money and lawful notice are pretty much the same.
'    'I am obliged to you for your good opinion,' retorted the single  gentleman, 'and quite concur in these sentiments.
  But that is not the  subject on which I wish to speak with you.
'    'Oh!' said Sally.
  'Then just state the particulars, will you?  I  suppose it's professional business?'    'Why, it is connected with the law, certainly.
'    'Very well,' returned Miss Brass.
  'My brother and I are just the same.
  I can take any instructions, or give you any advice.
'    'As there are other parties interested besides myself,' said the single  gentleman, rising and opening the door of an inner room, 'we had better  confer together.
  Miss Brass is here, gentlemen.
'    Mr Garland and the Notary walked in, looking very grave; and, drawing up  two chairs, one on each side of the single gentleman, formed a kind of  fence round the gentle Sarah, and penned her into a corner.
  Her brother  Sampson under such circumstances would certainly have evinced some  confusion or anxiety, but she--all composure--pulled out the tin box,  and calmly took a pinch of snuff.
    'Miss Brass,' said the Notary, taking the word at this crisis, 'we  professional people understand each other, and, when we choose, can say  what we have to say, in very few words.
  You advertised a runaway  servant, the other day?'    'Well,' returned Miss Sally, with a sudden flush overspreading her  features, 'what of that?'    'She is found, ma'am,' said the Notary, pulling out his  pocket-handkerchief with a flourish.
  'She is found.
'    'Who found her?' demanded Sarah hastily.
    'We did, ma'am--we three.
  Only last night, or you would have heard  from us before.
'    'And now I have heard from you,' said Miss Brass, folding her arms as  though she were about to deny something to the death, 'what have you  got to say?  Something you have got into your heads about her, of  course.
  Prove it, will you--that's all.
  Prove it.
  You have found  her, you say.
  I can tell you (if you don't know it) that you have  found the most artful, lying, pilfering, devilish little minx that was  ever born.
--Have you got her here?' she added, looking sharply round.
    'No, she is not here at present,' returned the Notary.
  'But she is  quite safe.
'    'Ha!' cried Sally, twitching a pinch of snuff out of her box, as  spitefully as if she were in the very act of wrenching off the small  servant's nose; 'she shall be safe enough from this time, I warrant  you.
'    'I hope so,' replied the Notary.
  'Did it occur to you for the first  time, when you found she had run away, that there were two keys to your  kitchen door?'    Miss Sally took another pinch, and putting her head on one side, looked  at her questioner, with a curious kind of spasm about her mouth, but  with a cunning aspect of immense expression.
    'Two keys,' repeated the Notary; 'one of which gave her the  opportunities of roaming through the house at nights when you supposed  her fast locked up, and of overhearing confidential  consultations--among others, that particular conference, to be  described to-day before a justice, which you will have an opportunity  of hearing her relate; that conference which you and Mr Brass held  together, on the night before that most unfortunate and innocent young  man was accused of robbery, by a horrible device of which I will only  say that it may be characterised by the epithets which you have applied  to this wretched little witness, and by a few stronger ones besides.
'    Sally took another pinch.
  Although her face was wonderfully composed,  it was apparent that she was wholly taken by surprise, and that what  she had expected to be taxed with, in connection with her small  servant, was something very different from this.
    'Come, come, Miss Brass,' said the Notary, 'you have great command of  feature, but you feel, I see, that by a chance which never entered your  imagination, this base design is revealed, and two of its plotters must  be brought to justice.
  Now, you know the pains and penalties you are  liable to, and so I need not dilate upon them, but I have a proposal to  make to you.
  You have the honour of being sister to one of the  greatest scoundrels unhung; and, if I may venture to say so to a lady,  you are in every respect quite worthy of him.
  But connected with you  two is a third party, a villain of the name of Quilp, the prime mover  of the whole diabolical device, who I believe to be worse than either.
  For his sake, Miss Brass, do us the favour to reveal the whole history  of this affair.
  Let me remind you that your doing so, at our instance,  will place you in a safe and comfortable position--your present one is  not desirable--and cannot injure your brother; for against him and you  we have quite sufficient evidence (as you hear) already.
  I will not  say to you that we suggest this course in mercy (for, to tell you the  truth, we do not entertain any regard for you), but it is a necessity  to which we are reduced, and I recommend it to you as a matter of the  very best policy.
  Time,' said Mr Witherden, pulling out his watch, 'in  a business like this, is exceedingly precious.
  Favour us with your  decision as speedily as possible, ma'am.
'    With a smile upon her face, and looking at each of the three by turns,  Miss Brass took two or three more pinches of snuff, and having by this  time very little left, travelled round and round the box with her  forefinger and thumb, scraping up another.
  Having disposed of this  likewise and put the box carefully in her pocket, she said,--    'I am to accept or reject at once, am I?'    'Yes,' said Mr Witherden.
    The charming creature was opening her lips to speak in reply, when the  door was hastily opened too, and the head of Sampson Brass was thrust  into the room.
    'Excuse me,' said the gentleman hastily.
  'Wait a bit!'    So saying, and quite indifferent to the astonishment his presence  occasioned, he crept in, shut the door, kissed his greasy glove as  servilely as if it were the dust, and made a most abject bow.
    'Sarah,' said Brass, 'hold your tongue if you please, and let me speak.
  Gentlemen, if I could express the pleasure it gives me to see three  such men in a happy unity of feeling and concord of sentiment, I think  you would hardly believe me.
  But though I am unfortunate--nay,  gentlemen, criminal, if we are to use harsh expressions in a company  like this--still, I have my feelings like other men.
  I have heard of a  poet, who remarked that feelings were the common lot of all.
  If he  could have been a pig, gentlemen, and have uttered that sentiment, he  would still have been immortal.
'    'If you're not an idiot,' said Miss Brass harshly, 'hold your peace.
'    'Sarah, my dear,' returned her brother, 'thank you.
  But I know what I  am about, my love, and will take the liberty of expressing myself  accordingly.
  Mr Witherden, Sir, your handkerchief is hanging out of  your pocket--would you allow me to--,    As Mr Brass advanced to remedy this accident, the Notary shrunk from  him with an air of disgust.
  Brass, who over and above his usual  prepossessing qualities, had a scratched face, a green shade over one  eye, and a hat grievously crushed, stopped short, and looked round with  a pitiful smile.
    'He shuns me,' said Sampson, 'even when I would, as I may say, heap  coals of fire upon his head.
  Well!  Ah! But I am a falling house, and  the rats (if I may be allowed the expression in reference to a  gentleman I respect and love beyond everything) fly from me!  Gentlemen--regarding your conversation just now, I happened to see my  sister on her way here, and, wondering where she could be going to, and  being--may I venture to say?--naturally of a suspicious turn, followed  her.
  Since then, I have been listening.
'    'If you're not mad,' interposed Miss Sally, 'stop there, and say no  more.
'    'Sarah, my dear,' rejoined Brass with undiminished politeness, 'I thank  you kindly, but will still proceed.
  Mr Witherden, sir, as we have the  honour to be members of the same profession--to say nothing of that  other gentleman having been my lodger, and having partaken, as one may  say, of the hospitality of my roof--I think you might have given me the  refusal of this offer in the first instance.
  I do indeed.
  Now, my  dear Sir,' cried Brass, seeing that the Notary was about to interrupt  him, 'suffer me to speak, I beg.
'    Mr Witherden was silent, and Brass went on.
    'If you will do me the favour,' he said, holding up the green shade,  and revealing an eye most horribly discoloured, 'to look at this, you  will naturally inquire, in your own minds, how did I get it.
  If you  look from that, to my face, you will wonder what could have been the  cause of all these scratches.
  And if from them to my hat, how it came  into the state in which you see it.
  Gentlemen,' said Brass, striking  the hat fiercely with his clenched hand, 'to all these questions I  answer--Quilp!'    The three gentlemen looked at each other, but said nothing.
    'I say,' pursued Brass, glancing aside at his sister, as though he were  talking for her information, and speaking with a snarling malignity, in  violent contrast to his usual smoothness, 'that I answer to all these  questions,--Quilp--Quilp, who deludes me into his infernal den, and  takes a delight in looking on and chuckling while I scorch, and burn,  and bruise, and maim myself--Quilp, who never once, no never once, in  all our communications together, has treated me otherwise than as a  dog--Quilp, whom I have always hated with my whole heart, but never so  much as lately.
  He gives me the cold shoulder on this very matter as  if he had had nothing to do with it, instead of being the first to  propose it.
  I can't trust him.
  In one of his howling, raving, blazing  humours, I believe he'd let it out, if it was murder, and never think  of himself so long as he could terrify me.
  Now,' said Brass, picking  up his hat again and replacing the shade over his eye, and actually  crouching down, in the excess of his servility, 'what does all this  lead to?--what should you say it led me to, gentlemen?--could you guess  at all near the mark?'    Nobody spoke.
  Brass stood smirking for a little while, as if he had  propounded some choice conundrum; and then said:    'To be short with you, then, it leads me to this.
  If the truth has  come out, as it plainly has in a manner that there's no standing up  against--and a very sublime and grand thing is Truth, gentlemen, in its  way, though like other sublime and grand things, such as thunder-storms  and that, we're not always over and above glad to see it--I had better  turn upon this man than let this man turn upon me.
  It's clear to me  that I am done for.
  Therefore, if anybody is to split, I had better be  the person and have the advantage of it.
  Sarah, my dear, comparatively  speaking you're safe.
  I relate these circumstances for my own profit.
'    With that, Mr Brass, in a great hurry, revealed the whole story;  bearing as heavily as possible on his amiable employer, and making  himself out to be rather a saint-like and holy character, though  subject--he acknowledged--to human weaknesses.
  He concluded thus:    'Now, gentlemen, I am not a man who does things by halves.
  Being in  for a penny, I am ready, as the saying is, to be in for a pound.
  You  must do with me what you please, and take me where you please.
  If you  wish to have this in writing, we'll reduce it into manuscript  immediately.
  You will be tender with me, I am sure.
  I am quite  confident you will be tender with me.
  You are men of honour, and have  feeling hearts.
  I yielded from necessity to Quilp, for though  necessity has no law, she has her lawyers.
  I yield to you from  necessity too; from policy besides; and because of feelings that have  been a pretty long time working within me.
  Punish Quilp, gentlemen.
  Weigh heavily upon him.
  Grind him down.
  Tread him under foot.
  He has  done as much by me, for many and many a day.
'    Having now arrived at the conclusion of his discourse, Sampson checked  the current of his wrath, kissed his glove again, and smiled as only  parasites and cowards can.
    'And this,' said Miss Brass, raising her head, with which she had  hitherto sat resting on her hands, and surveying him from head to foot  with a bitter sneer, 'this is my brother, is it!  This is my brother,  that I have worked and toiled for, and believed to have had something  of the man in him!'    'Sarah, my dear,' returned Sampson, rubbing his hands feebly; 'you  disturb our friends.
  Besides you--you're disappointed, Sarah, and, not  knowing what you say, expose yourself.
'    'Yes, you pitiful dastard,' retorted the lovely damsel, 'I understand  you.
  You feared that I should be beforehand with you.
  But do you  think that I would have been enticed to say a word!  I'd have scorned  it, if they had tried and tempted me for twenty years.
'    'He he!' simpered Brass, who, in his deep debasement, really seemed to  have changed sexes with his sister, and to have made over to her any  spark of manliness he might have possessed.
  'You think so, Sarah, you  think so perhaps; but you would have acted quite different, my good  fellow.
  You will not have forgotten that it was a maxim with  Foxey--our revered father, gentlemen--"Always suspect everybody.
"  That's the maxim to go through life with!  If you were not actually  about to purchase your own safety when I showed myself, I suspect you'd  have done it by this time.
  And therefore I've done it myself, and  spared you the trouble as well as the shame.
  The shame, gentlemen,'  added Brass, allowing himself to be slightly overcome, 'if there is  any, is mine.
  It's better that a female should be spared it.
'    With deference to the better opinion of Mr Brass, and more particularly  to the authority of his Great Ancestor, it may be doubted, with  humility, whether the elevating principle laid down by the latter  gentleman, and acted upon by his descendant, is always a prudent one,  or attended in practice with the desired results.
  This is, beyond  question, a bold and presumptuous doubt, inasmuch as many distinguished  characters, called men of the world, long-headed customers, knowing  dogs, shrewd fellows, capital hands at business, and the like, have  made, and do daily make, this axiom their polar star and compass.
  Still, the doubt may be gently insinuated.
  And in illustration it may  be observed, that if Mr Brass, not being over-suspicious, had, without  prying and listening, left his sister to manage the conference on their  joint behalf, or prying and listening, had not been in such a mighty  hurry to anticipate her (which he would not have been, but for his  distrust and jealousy), he would probably have found himself much  better off in the end.
  Thus, it will always happen that these men of  the world, who go through it in armour, defend themselves from quite as  much good as evil; to say nothing of the inconvenience and absurdity of  mounting guard with a microscope at all times, and of wearing a coat of  mail on the most innocent occasions.
    The three gentlemen spoke together apart, for a few moments.
  At the  end of their consultation, which was very brief, the Notary pointed to  the writing materials on the table, and informed Mr Brass that if he  wished to make any statement in writing, he had the opportunity of  doing so.
  At the same time he felt bound to tell him that they would  require his attendance, presently, before a justice of the peace, and  that in what he did or said, he was guided entirely by his own  discretion.
    'Gentlemen,' said Brass, drawing off his glove, and crawling in spirit  upon the ground before them, 'I will justify the tenderness with which  I know I shall be treated; and as, without tenderness, I should, now  that this discovery has been made, stand in the worst position of the  three, you may depend upon it I will make a clean breast.
  Mr  Witherden, sir, a kind of faintness is upon my spirits--if you would  do me the favour to ring the bell and order up a glass of something  warm and spicy, I shall, notwithstanding what has passed, have a  melancholy pleasure in drinking your good health.
  I had hoped,' said  Brass, looking round with a mournful smile, 'to have seen you three  gentlemen, one day or another, with your legs under the mahogany in my  humble parlour in the Marks.
  But hopes are fleeting.
  Dear me!'    Mr Brass found himself so exceedingly affected, at this point, that he  could say or do nothing more until some refreshment arrived.
  Having  partaken of it, pretty freely for one in his agitated state, he sat  down to write.
    The lovely Sarah, now with her arms folded, and now with her hands  clasped behind her, paced the room with manly strides while her brother  was thus employed, and sometimes stopped to pull out her snuff-box and  bite the lid.
  She continued to pace up and down until she was quite  tired, and then fell asleep on a chair near the door.
    It has been since supposed, with some reason, that this slumber was a  sham or feint, as she contrived to slip away unobserved in the dusk of  the afternoon.
  Whether this was an intentional and waking departure,  or a somnambulistic leave-taking and walking in her sleep, may remain a  subject of contention; but, on one point (and indeed the main one) all  parties are agreed.
  In whatever state she walked away, she certainly  did not walk back again.
    Mention having been made of the dusk of the afternoon, it will be  inferred that Mr Brass's task occupied some time in the completion.
  It  was not finished until evening; but, being done at last, that worthy  person and the three friends adjourned in a hackney-coach to the  private office of a justice, who, giving Mr Brass a warm reception and  detaining him in a secure place that he might insure to himself the  pleasure of seeing him on the morrow, dismissed the others with the  cheering assurance that a warrant could not fail to be granted next day  for the apprehension of Mr Quilp, and that a proper application and  statement of all the circumstances to the secretary of state (who was  fortunately in town), would no doubt procure Kit's free pardon and  liberation without delay.
    And now, indeed, it seemed that Quilp's malignant career was drawing to  a close, and that retribution, which often travels slowly--especially  when heaviest--had tracked his footsteps with a sure and certain scent  and was gaining on him fast.
  Unmindful of her stealthy tread, her  victim holds his course in fancied triumph.
  Still at his heels she  comes, and once afoot, is never turned aside!    Their business ended, the three gentlemen hastened back to the lodgings  of Mr Swiveller, whom they found progressing so favourably in his  recovery as to have been able to sit up for half an hour, and to have  conversed with cheerfulness.
  Mrs Garland had gone home some time  since, but Mr Abel was still sitting with him.
  After telling him all  they had done, the two Mr Garlands and the single gentleman, as if by  some previous understanding, took their leaves for the night, leaving  the invalid alone with the Notary and the small servant.
    'As you are so much better,' said Mr Witherden, sitting down at the  bedside, 'I may venture to communicate to you a piece of news which has  come to me professionally.
'    The idea of any professional intelligence from a gentleman connected  with legal matters, appeared to afford Richard any-thing but a pleasing  anticipation.
  Perhaps he connected it in his own mind with one or two  outstanding accounts, in reference to which he had already received  divers threatening letters.
  His countenance fell as he replied,    'Certainly, sir.
  I hope it's not anything of a very disagreeable  nature, though?'    'If I thought it so, I should choose some better time for communicating  it,' replied the Notary.
  'Let me tell you, first, that my friends who  have been here to-day, know nothing of it, and that their kindness to  you has been quite spontaneous and with no hope of return.
  It may do a  thoughtless, careless man, good, to know that.
'    Dick thanked him, and said he hoped it would.
    'I have been making some inquiries about you,' said Mr Witherden,  'little thinking that I should find you under such circumstances as  those which have brought us together.
  You are the nephew of Rebecca  Swiveller, spinster, deceased, of Cheselbourne in Dorsetshire.
'    'Deceased!' cried Dick.
    'Deceased.
  If you had been another sort of nephew, you would have come  into possession (so says the will, and I see no reason to doubt it) of  five-and-twenty thousand pounds.
  As it is, you have fallen into an  annuity of one hundred and fifty pounds a year; but I think I may  congratulate you even upon that.
'    'Sir,' said Dick, sobbing and laughing together, 'you may.
  For, please  God, we'll make a scholar of the poor Marchioness yet!  And she shall  walk in silk attire, and siller have to spare, or may I never rise from  this bed again!'              Unconscious of the proceedings faithfully narrated in the last chapter,  and little dreaming of the mine which had been sprung beneath him (for,  to the end that he should have no warning of the business a-foot, the  profoundest secrecy was observed in the whole transaction), Mr Quilp  remained shut up in his hermitage, undisturbed by any suspicion, and  extremely well satisfied with the result of his machinations.
  Being  engaged in the adjustment of some accounts--an occupation to which the  silence and solitude of his retreat were very favourable--he had not  strayed from his den for two whole days.
  The third day of his devotion  to this pursuit found him still hard at work, and little disposed to  stir abroad.
    It was the day next after Mr Brass's confession, and consequently, that  which threatened the restriction of Mr Quilp's liberty, and the abrupt  communication to him of some very unpleasant and unwelcome facts.
  Having no intuitive perception of the cloud which lowered upon his  house, the dwarf was in his ordinary state of cheerfulness; and, when  he found he was becoming too much engrossed by business with a due  regard to his health and spirits, he varied its monotonous routine with  a little screeching, or howling, or some other innocent relaxation of  that nature.
    He was attended, as usual, by Tom Scott, who sat crouching over the  fire after the manner of a toad, and, from time to time, when his  master's back was turned, imitating his grimaces with a fearful  exactness.
  The figure-head had not yet disappeared, but remained in  its old place.
  The face, horribly seared by the frequent application  of the red-hot poker, and further ornamented by the insertion, in the  tip of the nose, of a tenpenny nail, yet smiled blandly in its less  lacerated parts, and seemed, like a sturdy martyr, to provoke its  tormentor to the commission of new outrages and insults.
    The day, in the highest and brightest quarters of the town, was damp,  dark, cold and gloomy.
  In that low and marshy spot, the fog filled  every nook and corner with a thick dense cloud.
  Every object was  obscure at one or two yards' distance.
  The warning lights and fires  upon the river were powerless beneath this pall, and, but for a raw and  piercing chillness in the air, and now and then the cry of some  bewildered boatman as he rested on his oars and tried to make out where  he was, the river itself might have been miles away.
    The mist, though sluggish and slow to move, was of a keenly searching  kind.
  No muffling up in furs and broadcloth kept it out.
  It seemed to  penetrate into the very bones of the shrinking wayfarers, and to rack  them with cold and pains.
  Everything was wet and clammy to the touch.
  The warm blaze alone defied it, and leaped and sparkled merrily.
  It  was a day to be at home, crowding about the fire, telling stories of  travellers who had lost their way in such weather on heaths and moors;  and to love a warm hearth more than ever.
    The dwarf's humour, as we know, was to have a fireside to himself; and  when he was disposed to be convivial, to enjoy himself alone.
  By no  means insensible to the comfort of being within doors, he ordered Tom  Scott to pile the little stove with coals, and, dismissing his work for  that day, determined to be jovial.
    To this end, he lighted up fresh candles and heaped more fuel on the  fire; and having dined off a beefsteak, which he cooked himself in  somewhat of a savage and cannibal-like manner, brewed a great bowl of  hot punch, lighted his pipe, and sat down to spend the evening.
    At this moment, a low knocking at the cabin-door arrested his  attention.
  When it had been twice or thrice repeated, he softly opened  the little window, and thrusting his head out, demanded who was there.
    'Only me, Quilp,' replied a woman's voice.
    'Only you!' cried the dwarf, stretching his neck to obtain a better  view of his visitor.
  'And what brings you here, you jade?  How dare  you approach the ogre's castle, eh?'    'I have come with some news,' rejoined his spouse.
  'Don't be angry  with me.
'    'Is it good news, pleasant news, news to make a man skip and snap his  fingers?' said the dwarf.
  'Is the dear old lady dead?'    'I don't know what news it is, or whether it's good or bad,' rejoined  his wife.
    'Then she's alive,' said Quilp, 'and there's nothing the matter with  her.
  Go home again, you bird of evil note, go home!'    'I have brought a letter,' cried the meek little woman.
    'Toss it in at the window here, and go your ways,' said Quilp,  interrupting her, 'or I'll come out and scratch you.
'    'No, but please, Quilp--do hear me speak,' urged his submissive wife,  in tears.
  'Please do!'    'Speak then,' growled the dwarf with a malicious grin.
  'Be quick and  short about it.
  Speak, will you?'    'It was left at our house this afternoon,' said Mrs Quilp, trembling,  'by a boy who said he didn't know from whom it came, but that it was  given to him to leave, and that he was told to say it must be brought  on to you directly, for it was of the very greatest consequence.
--But  please,' she added, as her husband stretched out his hand for it,  'please let me in.
  You don't know how wet and cold I am, or how many  times I have lost my way in coming here through this thick fog.
  Let me  dry myself at the fire for five minutes.
  I'll go away directly you  tell me to, Quilp.
  Upon my word I will.
'    Her amiable husband hesitated for a few moments; but, bethinking  himself that the letter might require some answer, of which she could  be the bearer, closed the window, opened the door, and bade her enter.
  Mrs Quilp obeyed right willingly, and, kneeling down before the fire to  warm her hands, delivered into his a little packet.
    'I'm glad you're wet,' said Quilp, snatching it, and squinting at her.
  'I'm glad you're cold.
  I'm glad you lost your way.
  I'm glad your eyes  are red with crying.
  It does my heart good to see your little nose so  pinched and frosty.
'    'Oh Quilp!' sobbed his wife.
  'How cruel it is of you!'    'Did she think I was dead?' said Quilp, wrinkling his face into a most  extraordinary series of grimaces.
  'Did she think she was going to have  all the money, and to marry somebody she liked?  Ha ha ha!  Did she?'    These taunts elicited no reply from the poor little woman, who remained  on her knees, warming her hands, and sobbing, to Mr Quilp's great  delight.
  But, just as he was contemplating her, and chuckling  excessively, he happened to observe that Tom Scott was delighted too;  wherefore, that he might have no presumptuous partner in his glee, the  dwarf instantly collared him, dragged him to the door, and after a  short scuffle, kicked him into the yard.
  In return for this mark of  attention, Tom immediately walked upon his hands to the window, and--if  the expression be allowable--looked in with his shoes: besides  rattling his feet upon the glass like a Banshee upside down.
  As a  matter of course, Mr Quilp lost no time in resorting to the infallible  poker, with which, after some dodging and lying in ambush, he paid his  young friend one or two such unequivocal compliments that he vanished  precipitately, and left him in quiet possession of the field.
    'So!  That little job being disposed of,' said the dwarf, coolly, 'I'll  read my letter.
  Humph!' he muttered, looking at the direction.
  'I  ought to know this writing.
  Beautiful Sally!'    Opening it, he read, in a fair, round, legal hand, as follows:    'Sammy has been practised upon, and has broken confidence.
  It has all  come out.
  You had better not be in the way, for strangers are going to  call upon you.
  They have been very quiet as yet, because they mean to  surprise you.
  Don't lose time.
  I didn't.
  I am not to be found  anywhere.
  If I was you, I wouldn't either.
  S.

'    To describe the changes that passed over Quilp's face, as he read this  letter half-a-dozen times, would require some new language: such, for  power of expression, as was never written, read, or spoken.
  For a long  time he did not utter one word; but, after a considerable interval,  during which Mrs Quilp was almost paralysed with the alarm his looks  engendered, he contrived to gasp out,    'If I had him here.
  If I only had him here--'    'Oh Quilp!' said his wife, 'what's the matter?  Who are you angry with?'    '--I should drown him,' said the dwarf, not heeding her.
  'Too easy a  death, too short, too quick--but the river runs close at hand.
  Oh! if  I had him here! just to take him to the brink coaxingly and  pleasantly,--holding him by the button-hole--joking with him,--and,  with a sudden push, to send him splashing down!  Drowning men come to  the surface three times they say.
  Ah!  To see him those three times,  and mock him as his face came bobbing up,--oh, what a rich treat that  would be!'    'Quilp!' stammered his wife, venturing at the same time to touch him on  the shoulder: 'what has gone wrong?'    She was so terrified by the relish with which he pictured this pleasure  to himself that she could scarcely make herself intelligible.
    'Such a bloodless cur!' said Quilp, rubbing his hands very slowly, and  pressing them tight together.
  'I thought his cowardice and servility  were the best guarantee for his keeping silence.
  Oh Brass, Brass--my  dear, good, affectionate, faithful, complimentary, charming friend--if  I only had you here!'    His wife, who had retreated lest she should seem to listen to these  mutterings, ventured to approach him again, and was about to speak,  when he hurried to the door, and called Tom Scott, who, remembering his  late gentle admonition, deemed it prudent to appear immediately.
    'There!' said the dwarf, pulling him in.
  'Take her home.
  Don't come  here to-morrow, for this place will be shut up.
  Come back no more till  you hear from me or see me.
  Do you mind?'    Tom nodded sulkily, and beckoned Mrs Quilp to lead the way.
    'As for you,' said the dwarf, addressing himself to her, 'ask no  questions about me, make no search for me, say nothing concerning me.
  I shall not be dead, mistress, and that'll comfort you.
  He'll take  care of you.
'    'But, Quilp?  What is the matter?  Where are you going?  Do say  something more?'    'I'll say that,' said the dwarf, seizing her by the arm, 'and do that  too, which undone and unsaid would be best for you, unless you go  directly.
'    'Has anything happened?' cried his wife.
  'Oh!  Do tell me that?'    'Yes,' snarled the dwarf.
  'No.
  What matter which?  I have told you  what to do.
  Woe betide you if you fail to do it, or disobey me by a  hair's breadth.
  Will you go!'    'I am going, I'll go directly; but,' faltered his wife, 'answer me one  question first.
  Has this letter any connexion with dear little Nell?  I must ask you that--I must indeed, Quilp.
  You cannot think what days  and nights of sorrow I have had through having once deceived that  child.
  I don't know what harm I may have brought about, but, great or  little, I did it for you, Quilp.
  My conscience misgave me when I did  it.
  Do answer me this question, if you please?'    The exasperated dwarf returned no answer, but turned round and caught  up his usual weapon with such vehemence, that Tom Scott dragged his  charge away, by main force, and as swiftly as he could.
  It was well he  did so, for Quilp, who was nearly mad with rage, pursued them to the  neighbouring lane, and might have prolonged the chase but for the dense  mist which obscured them from his view and appeared to thicken every  moment.
    'It will be a good night for travelling anonymously,' he said, as he  returned slowly, being pretty well breathed with his run.
  'Stay.
  We  may look better here.
  This is too hospitable and free.
'    By a great exertion of strength, he closed the two old gates, which  were deeply sunken in the mud, and barred them with a heavy beam.
  That  done, he shook his matted hair from about his eyes, and tried  them.
--Strong and fast.
    'The fence between this wharf and the next is easily climbed,' said the  dwarf, when he had taken these precautions.
  'There's a back lane, too,  from there.
  That shall be my way out.
  A man need know his road well,  to find it in this lovely place to-night.
  I need fear no unwelcome  visitors while this lasts, I think.
'    Almost reduced to the necessity of groping his way with his hands (it  had grown so dark and the fog had so much increased), he returned to  his lair; and, after musing for some time over the fire, busied himself  in preparations for a speedy departure.
    While he was collecting a few necessaries and cramming them into his  pockets, he never once ceased communing with himself in a low voice, or  unclenched his teeth, which he had ground together on finishing Miss  Brass's note.
    'Oh Sampson!' he muttered, 'good worthy creature--if I could but hug  you!  If I could only fold you in my arms, and squeeze your ribs, as I  COULD squeeze them if I once had you tight--what a meeting there would  be between us!  If we ever do cross each other again, Sampson, we'll  have a greeting not easily to be forgotten, trust me.
  This time,  Sampson, this moment when all had gone on so well, was so nicely  chosen!  It was so thoughtful of you, so penitent, so good.
  Oh, if we  were face to face in this room again, my white-livered man of law, how  well contented one of us would be!'    There he stopped; and raising the bowl of punch to his lips, drank a  long deep draught, as if it were fair water and cooling to his parched  mouth.
  Setting it down abruptly, and resuming his preparations, he  went on with his soliloquy.
    'There's Sally,' he said, with flashing eyes; 'the woman has spirit,  determination, purpose--was she asleep, or petrified?  She could have  stabbed him--poisoned him safely.
  She might have seen this coming on.
  Why does she give me notice when it's too late?  When he sat  there,--yonder there, over there,--with his white face, and red head,  and sickly smile, why didn't I know what was passing in his heart?  It  should have stopped beating, that night, if I had been in his secret,  or there are no drugs to lull a man to sleep, or no fire to burn him!'    Another draught from the bowl; and, cowering over the fire with a  ferocious aspect, he muttered to himself again.
    'And this, like every other trouble and anxiety I have had of late  times, springs from that old dotard and his darling child--two wretched  feeble wanderers!  I'll be their evil genius yet.
  And you, sweet Kit,  honest Kit, virtuous, innocent Kit, look to yourself.
  Where I hate, I  bite.
  I hate you, my darling fellow, with good cause, and proud as you  are to-night, I'll have my turn.
----What's that?'    A knocking at the gate he had closed.
  A loud and violent knocking.
  Then, a pause; as if those who knocked had stopped to listen.
  Then,  the noise again, more clamorous and importunate than before.
    'So soon!' said the dwarf.
  'And so eager!  I am afraid I shall disappoint  you.
  It's well I'm quite prepared.
  Sally, I thank you!'    As he spoke, he extinguished the candle.
  In his impetuous attempts to  subdue the brightness of the fire, he overset the stove, which came  tumbling forward, and fell with a crash upon the burning embers it had  shot forth in its descent, leaving the room in pitchy darkness.
  The  noise at the gate still continuing, he felt his way to the door, and  stepped into the open air.
    At that moment the knocking ceased.
  It was about eight o'clock; but  the dead of the darkest night would have been as noon-day in comparison  with the thick cloud which then rested upon the earth, and shrouded  everything from view.
  He darted forward for a few paces, as if into  the mouth of some dim, yawning cavern; then, thinking he had gone  wrong, changed the direction of his steps; then stood still, not  knowing where to turn.
    'If they would knock again,' said Quilp, trying to peer into the gloom  by which he was surrounded, 'the sound might guide me!  Come!  Batter  the gate once more!'    He stood listening intently, but the noise was not renewed.
  Nothing  was to be heard in that deserted place, but, at intervals, the distant  barkings of dogs.
  The sound was far away--now in one quarter, now  answered in another--nor was it any guide, for it often came from  shipboard, as he knew.
    'If I could find a wall or fence,' said the dwarf, stretching out his  arms, and walking slowly on, 'I should know which way to turn.
  A good,  black, devil's night this, to have my dear friend here!  If I had but  that wish, it might, for anything I cared, never be day again.
'    As the word passed his lips, he staggered and fell--and next moment was  fighting with the cold dark water!    For all its bubbling up and rushing in his ears, he could hear the  knocking at the gate again--could hear a shout that followed it--could  recognise the voice.
  For all his struggling and plashing, he could  understand that they had lost their way, and had wandered back to the  point from which they started; that they were all but looking on, while  he was drowned; that they were close at hand, but could not make an  effort to save him; that he himself had shut and barred them out.
  He  answered the shout--with a yell, which seemed to make the hundred fires  that danced before his eyes tremble and flicker, as if a gust of wind  had stirred them.
  It was of no avail.
  The strong tide filled his  throat, and bore him on, upon its rapid current.
    Another mortal struggle, and he was up again, beating the water with  his hands, and looking out, with wild and glaring eyes that showed him  some black object he was drifting close upon.
  The hull of a ship!  He  could touch its smooth and slippery surface with his hand.
  One loud  cry, now--but the resistless water bore him down before he could give  it utterance, and, driving him under it, carried away a corpse.
    It toyed and sported with its ghastly freight, now bruising it against  the slimy piles, now hiding it in mud or long rank grass, now dragging  it heavily over rough stones and gravel, now feigning to yield it to  its own element, and in the same action luring it away, until, tired of  the ugly plaything, it flung it on a swamp--a dismal place where  pirates had swung in chains through many a wintry night--and left it  there to bleach.
    And there it lay alone.
  The sky was red with flame, and the water that  bore it there had been tinged with the sullen light as it flowed along.
  The place the deserted carcass had left so recently, a living man, was  now a blazing ruin.
  There was something of the glare upon its face.
  The hair, stirred by the damp breeze, played in a kind of mockery of  death--such a mockery as the dead man himself would have delighted in  when alive--about its head, and its dress fluttered idly in the night  wind.
              Lighted rooms, bright fires, cheerful faces, the music of glad voices,  words of love and welcome, warm hearts, and tears of happiness--what a  change is this!  But it is to such delights that Kit is hastening.
  They are awaiting him, he knows.
  He fears he will die of joy, before  he gets among them.
    They have prepared him for this, all day.
  He is not to be carried off  to-morrow with the rest, they tell him first.
  By degrees they let him  know that doubts have arisen, that inquiries are to be made, and  perhaps he may be pardoned after all.
  At last, the evening being come,  they bring him to a room where some gentlemen are assembled.
  Foremost  among them is his good old master, who comes and takes him by the hand.
  He hears that his innocence is established, and that he is pardoned.
  He cannot see the speaker, but he turns towards the voice, and in  trying to answer, falls down insensible.
    They recover him again, and tell him he must be composed, and bear this  like a man.
  Somebody says he must think of his poor mother.
  It is  because he does think of her so much, that the happy news had  overpowered him.
  They crowd about him, and tell him that the truth has  gone abroad, and that all the town and country ring with sympathy for  his misfortunes.
  He has no ears for this.
  His thoughts, as yet, have  no wider range than home.
  Does she know it?  what did she say? who  told her?  He can speak of nothing else.
    They make him drink a little wine, and talk kindly to him for a while,  until he is more collected, and can listen, and thank them.
  He is free  to go.
  Mr Garland thinks, if he feels better, it is time they went  away.
  The gentlemen cluster round him, and shake hands with him.
  He  feels very grateful to them for the interest they have in him, and for  the kind promises they make; but the power of speech is gone again, and  he has much ado to keep his feet, even though leaning on his master's  arm.
    As they come through the dismal passages, some officers of the jail who  are in waiting there, congratulate him, in their rough way, on his  release.
  The newsmonger is of the number, but his manner is not quite  hearty--there is something of surliness in his compliments.
  He looks  upon Kit as an intruder, as one who has obtained admission to that  place on false pretences, who has enjoyed a privilege without being  duly qualified.
  He may be a very good sort of young man, he thinks,  but he has no business there, and the sooner he is gone, the better.
    The last door shuts behind them.
  They have passed the outer wall, and  stand in the open air--in the street he has so often pictured to  himself when hemmed in by the gloomy stones, and which has been in all  his dreams.
  It seems wider and more busy than it used to be.
  The  night is bad, and yet how cheerful and gay in his eyes!  One of the  gentlemen, in taking leave of him, pressed some money into his hand.
  He has not counted it; but when they have gone a few paces beyond the  box for poor Prisoners, he hastily returns and drops it in.
    Mr Garland has a coach waiting in a neighbouring street, and, taking  Kit inside with him, bids the man drive home.
  At first, they can only  travel at a foot pace, and then with torches going on before, because  of the heavy fog.
  But, as they get farther from the river, and leave  the closer portions of the town behind, they are able to dispense with  this precaution and to proceed at a brisker rate.
  On the road, hard  galloping would be too slow for Kit; but, when they are drawing near  their journey's end, he begs they may go more slowly, and, when the  house appears in sight, that they may stop--only for a minute or two,  to give him time to breathe.
    But there is no stopping then, for the old gentleman speaks stoutly to  him, the horses mend their pace, and they are already at the  garden-gate.
  Next minute, they are at the door.
  There is a noise of  tongues, and tread of feet, inside.
  It opens.
  Kit rushes in, and  finds his mother clinging round his neck.
    And there, too, is the ever faithful Barbara's mother, still holding  the baby as if she had never put it down since that sad day when they  little hoped to have such joy as this--there she is, Heaven bless her,  crying her eyes out, and sobbing as never woman sobbed before; and  there is little Barbara--poor little Barbara, so much thinner and so  much paler, and yet so very pretty--trembling like a leaf and  supporting herself against the wall; and there is Mrs Garland, neater  and nicer than ever, fainting away stone dead with nobody to help her;  and there is Mr Abel, violently blowing his nose, and wanting to  embrace everybody; and there is the single gentleman hovering round  them all, and constant to nothing for an instant; and there is that  good, dear, thoughtful little Jacob, sitting all alone by himself on  the bottom stair, with his hands on his knees like an old man, roaring  fearfully without giving any trouble to anybody; and each and all of  them are for the time clean out of their wits, and do jointly and  severally commit all manner of follies.
    And even when the rest have in some measure come to themselves again,  and can find words and smiles, Barbara--that soft-hearted, gentle,  foolish little Barbara--is suddenly missed, and found to be in a swoon  by herself in the back parlour, from which swoon she falls into  hysterics, and from which hysterics into a swoon again, and is, indeed,  so bad, that despite a mortal quantity of vinegar and cold water she is  hardly a bit better at last than she was at first.
  Then, Kit's mother  comes in and says, will he come and speak to her; and Kit says 'Yes,'  and goes; and he says in a kind voice 'Barbara!' and Barbara's mother  tells her that 'it's only Kit;' and Barbara says (with her eyes closed  all the time) 'Oh! but is it him indeed?' and Barbara's mother says 'To  be sure it is, my dear; there's nothing the matter now.
'  And in  further assurance that he's safe and sound, Kit speaks to her again;  and then Barbara goes off into another fit of laughter, and then into  another fit of crying; and then Barbara's mother and Kit's mother nod  to each other and pretend to scold her--but only to bring her to  herself the faster, bless you!--and being experienced matrons, and  acute at perceiving the first dawning symptoms of recovery, they  comfort Kit with the assurance that 'she'll do now,' and so dismiss him  to the place from whence he came.
    Well!  In that place (which is the next room) there are decanters of  wine, and all that sort of thing, set out as grand as if Kit and his  friends were first-rate company; and there is little Jacob, walking, as  the popular phrase is, into a home-made plum-cake, at a most surprising  pace, and keeping his eye on the figs and oranges which are to follow,  and making the best use of his time, you may believe.
  Kit no sooner  comes in, than that single gentleman (never was such a busy gentleman)  charges all the glasses--bumpers--and drinks his health, and tells him  he shall never want a friend while he lives; and so does Mr Garland,  and so does Mrs Garland, and so does Mr Abel.
  But even this honour and  distinction is not all, for the single gentleman forthwith pulls out of  his pocket a massive silver watch--going hard, and right to half a  second--and upon the back of this watch is engraved Kit's name, with  flourishes all over; and in short it is Kit's watch, bought expressly  for him, and presented to him on the spot.
  You may rest assured that  Mr and Mrs Garland can't help hinting about their present, in store,  and that Mr Abel tells outright that he has his; and that Kit is the  happiest of the happy.
    There is one friend he has not seen yet, and as he cannot be  conveniently introduced into the family circle, by reason of his being  an iron-shod quadruped, Kit takes the first opportunity of slipping  away and hurrying to the stable.
  The moment he lays his hand upon the  latch, the pony neighs the loudest pony's greeting; before he has  crossed the threshold, the pony is capering about his loose box (for he  brooks not the indignity of a halter), mad to give him welcome; and  when Kit goes up to caress and pat him, the pony rubs his nose against  his coat, and fondles him more lovingly than ever pony fondled man.
  It  is the crowning circumstance of his earnest, heartfelt reception; and  Kit fairly puts his arm round Whisker's neck and hugs him.
    But how comes Barbara to trip in there? and how smart she is again!  she has been at her glass since she recovered.
  How comes Barbara in  the stable, of all places in the world?  Why, since Kit has been away,  the pony would take his food from nobody but her, and Barbara, you see,  not dreaming that Christopher was there, and just looking in, to see  that everything was right, has come upon him unawares.
  Blushing little  Barbara!    It may be that Kit has caressed the pony enough; it may be that there  are even better things to caress than ponies.
  He leaves him for  Barbara at any rate, and hopes she is better.
  Yes.
  Barbara is a great  deal better.
  She is afraid--and here Barbara looks down and blushes  more--that he must have thought her very foolish.
  'Not at all,' says  Kit.
  Barbara is glad of that, and coughs--Hem!--just the slightest  cough possible--not more than that.
    What a discreet pony when he chooses!  He is as quiet now as if he were  of marble.
  He has a very knowing look, but that he always has.
  'We  have hardly had time to shake hands, Barbara,' says Kit.
  Barbara gives  him hers.
  Why, she is trembling now!  Foolish, fluttering Barbara!    Arm's length?  The length of an arm is not much.
  Barbara's was not a  long arm, by any means, and besides, she didn't hold it out straight,  but bent a little.
  Kit was so near her when they shook hands, that he  could see a small tiny tear, yet trembling on an eyelash.
  It was  natural that he should look at it, unknown to Barbara.
  It was natural  that Barbara should raise her eyes unconsciously, and find him out.
  Was it natural that at that instant, without any previous impulse or  design, Kit should kiss Barbara?  He did it, whether or no.
  Barbara  said 'for shame,' but let him do it too--twice.
  He might have done it  thrice, but the pony kicked up his heels and shook his head, as if he  were suddenly taken with convulsions of delight, and Barbara being  frightened, ran away--not straight to where her mother and Kit's mother  were, though, lest they should see how red her cheeks were, and should  ask her why.
  Sly little Barbara!    When the first transports of the whole party had subsided, and Kit and  his mother, and Barbara and her mother, with little Jacob and the baby  to boot, had had their suppers together--which there was no hurrying  over, for they were going to stop there all night--Mr Garland called  Kit to him, and taking him into a room where they could be alone, told  him that he had something yet to say, which would surprise him greatly.
  Kit looked so anxious and turned so pale on hearing this, that the old  gentleman hastened to add, he would be agreeably surprised; and asked  him if he would be ready next morning for a journey.
    'For a journey, sir!' cried Kit.
    'In company with me and my friend in the next room.
  Can you guess its  purpose?'    Kit turned paler yet, and shook his head.
    'Oh yes.
  I think you do already,' said his master.
  'Try.
'    Kit murmured something rather rambling and unintelligible, but he  plainly pronounced the words 'Miss Nell,' three or four times--shaking  his head while he did so, as if he would add that there was no hope of  that.
    But Mr Garland, instead of saying 'Try again,' as Kit had made sure he  would, told him very seriously, that he had guessed right.
    'The place of their retreat is indeed discovered,' he said, 'at last.
  And that is our journey's end.
'    Kit faltered out such questions as, where was it, and how had it been  found, and how long since, and was she well and happy?    'Happy she is, beyond all doubt,' said Mr Garland.
  'And well, I--I  trust she will be soon.
  She has been weak and ailing, as I learn, but  she was better when I heard this morning, and they were full of hope.
  Sit you down, and you shall hear the rest.
'    Scarcely venturing to draw his breath, Kit did as he was told.
  Mr  Garland then related to him, how he had a brother (of whom he would  remember to have heard him speak, and whose picture, taken when he was  a young man, hung in the best room), and how this brother lived a long  way off, in a country-place, with an old clergyman who had been his  early friend.
  How, although they loved each other as brothers should,  they had not met for many years, but had communicated by letter from  time to time, always looking forward to some period when they would  take each other by the hand once more, and still letting the Present  time steal on, as it was the habit for men to do, and suffering the  Future to melt into the Past.
  How this brother, whose temper was very  mild and quiet and retiring--such as Mr Abel's--was greatly beloved by  the simple people among whom he dwelt, who quite revered the Bachelor  (for so they called him), and had every one experienced his charity and  benevolence.
  How even those slight circumstances had come to his  knowledge, very slowly and in course of years, for the Bachelor was one  of those whose goodness shuns the light, and who have more pleasure in  discovering and extolling the good deeds of others, than in trumpeting  their own, be they never so commendable.
  How, for that reason, he  seldom told them of his village friends; but how, for all that, his  mind had become so full of two among them--a child and an old man, to  whom he had been very kind--that, in a letter received a few days  before, he had dwelt upon them from first to last, and had told such a  tale of their wandering, and mutual love, that few could read it  without being moved to tears.
  How he, the recipient of that letter,  was directly led to the belief that these must be the very wanderers  for whom so much search had been made, and whom Heaven had directed to  his brother's care.
  How he had written for such further information as  would put the fact beyond all doubt; how it had that morning arrived;  had confirmed his first impression into a certainty; and was the  immediate cause of that journey being planned, which they were to take  to-morrow.
    'In the meantime,' said the old gentleman rising, and laying his hand  on Kit's shoulder, 'you have a great need of rest; for such a day as  this would wear out the strongest man.
  Good night, and Heaven send our  journey may have a prosperous ending!'              Kit was no sluggard next morning, but, springing from his bed some time  before day, began to prepare for his welcome expedition.
  The hurry of  spirits consequent upon the events of yesterday, and the unexpected  intelligence he had heard at night, had troubled his sleep through the  long dark hours, and summoned such uneasy dreams about his pillow that  it was best to rise.
    But, had it been the beginning of some great labour with the same end  in view--had it been the commencement of a long journey, to be  performed on foot in that inclement season of the year, to be pursued  under very privation and difficulty, and to be achieved only with great  distress, fatigue, and suffering--had it been the dawn of some painful  enterprise, certain to task his utmost powers of resolution and  endurance, and to need his utmost fortitude, but only likely to end, if  happily achieved, in good fortune and delight to Nell--Kit's cheerful  zeal would have been as highly roused: Kit's ardour and impatience  would have been, at least, the same.
    Nor was he alone excited and eager.
  Before he had been up a quarter of  an hour the whole house were astir and busy.
  Everybody hurried to do  something towards facilitating the preparations.
  The single gentleman,  it is true, could do nothing himself, but he overlooked everybody else  and was more locomotive than anybody.
  The work of packing and making  ready went briskly on, and by daybreak every preparation for the  journey was completed.
  Then Kit began to wish they had not been quite  so nimble; for the travelling-carriage which had been hired for the  occasion was not to arrive until nine o'clock, and there was nothing  but breakfast to fill up the intervening blank of one hour and a half.
  Yes there was, though.
  There was Barbara.
  Barbara was busy, to be  sure, but so much the better--Kit could help her, and that would pass  away the time better than any means that could be devised.
  Barbara had  no objection to this arrangement, and Kit, tracking out the idea which  had come upon him so suddenly overnight, began to think that surely  Barbara was fond of him, and surely he was fond of Barbara.
    Now, Barbara, if the truth must be told--as it must and ought to  be--Barbara seemed, of all the little household, to take least pleasure  in the bustle of the occasion; and when Kit, in the openness of his  heart, told her how glad and overjoyed it made him, Barbara became more  downcast still, and seemed to have even less pleasure in it than before!    'You have not been home so long, Christopher,' said Barbara--and it is  impossible to tell how carelessly she said it--'You have not been home  so long, that you need to be glad to go away again, I should think.
'    'But for such a purpose,' returned Kit.
  'To bring back Miss Nell!  To  see her again!  Only think of that!  I am so pleased too, to think that  you will see her, Barbara, at last.
'    Barbara did not absolutely say that she felt no gratification on this  point, but she expressed the sentiment so plainly by one little toss of  her head, that Kit was quite disconcerted, and wondered, in his  simplicity, why she was so cool about it.
    'You'll say she has the sweetest and beautifullest face you ever saw, I  know,' said Kit, rubbing his hands.
  'I'm sure you'll say that.
'    Barbara tossed her head again.
    'What's the matter, Barbara?' said Kit.
    'Nothing,' cried Barbara.
  And Barbara pouted--not sulkily, or in an  ugly manner, but just enough to make her look more cherry-lipped than  ever.
    There is no school in which a pupil gets on so fast, as that in which  Kit became a scholar when he gave Barbara the kiss.
  He saw what  Barbara meant now--he had his lesson by heart all at once--she was the  book--there it was before him, as plain as print.
    'Barbara,' said Kit, 'you're not cross with me?'    Oh dear no!  Why should Barbara be cross?  And what right had she to be  cross?  And what did it matter whether she was cross or not?  Who  minded her!    'Why, I do,' said Kit.
  'Of course I do.
'    Barbara didn't see why it was of course, at all.
    Kit was sure she must.
  Would she think again?    Certainly, Barbara would think again.
  No, she didn't see why it was of  course.
  She didn't understand what Christopher meant.
  And besides she  was sure they wanted her up stairs by this time, and she must go,  indeed--    'No, but Barbara,' said Kit, detaining her gently, 'let us part  friends.
  I was always thinking of you, in my troubles.
  I should have  been a great deal more miserable than I was, if it hadn't been for you.
'    Goodness gracious, how pretty Barbara was when she coloured--and when  she trembled, like a little shrinking bird!    'I am telling you the truth, Barbara, upon my word, but not half so  strong as I could wish,' said Kit.
  'When I want you to be pleased to  see Miss Nell, it's only because I like you to be pleased with what  pleases me--that's all.
  As to her, Barbara, I think I could almost die  to do her service, but you would think so too, if you knew her as I do.
  I am sure you would.
'    Barbara was touched, and sorry to have appeared indifferent.
    'I have been used, you see,' said Kit, 'to talk and think of her,  almost as if she was an angel.
  When I look forward to meeting her  again, I think of her smiling as she used to do, and being glad to see  me, and putting out her hand and saying, "It's my own old Kit," or some  such words as those--like what she used to say.
  I think of seeing her  happy, and with friends about her, and brought up as she deserves, and  as she ought to be.
  When I think of myself, it's as her old servant,  and one that loved her dearly, as his kind, good, gentle mistress; and  who would have gone--yes, and still would go--through any harm to serve  her.
  Once, I couldn't help being afraid that if she came back with  friends about her she might forget, or be ashamed of having known, a  humble lad like me, and so might speak coldly, which would have cut me,  Barbara, deeper than I can tell.
  But when I came to think again, I  felt sure that I was doing her wrong in this; and so I went on, as I  did at first, hoping to see her once more, just as she used to be.
  Hoping this, and remembering what she was, has made me feel as if I  would always try to please her, and always be what I should like to  seem to her if I was still her servant.
  If I'm the better for  that--and I don't think I'm the worse--I am grateful to her for it, and  love and honour her the more.
  That's the plain honest truth, dear  Barbara, upon my word it is!'    Little Barbara was not of a wayward or capricious nature, and, being  full of remorse, melted into tears.
  To what more conversation this  might have led, we need not stop to inquire; for the wheels of the  carriage were heard at that moment, and, being followed by a smart ring  at the garden gate, caused the bustle in the house, which had laid  dormant for a short time, to burst again into tenfold life and vigour.
    Simultaneously with the travelling equipage, arrived Mr Chuckster in a  hackney cab, with certain papers and supplies of money for the single  gentleman, into whose hands he delivered them.
  This duty discharged,  he subsided into the bosom of the family; and, entertaining himself  with a strolling or peripatetic breakfast, watched, with genteel  indifference, the process of loading the carriage.
    'Snobby's in this, I see, Sir?' he said to Mr Abel Garland.
  'I thought  he wasn't in the last trip because it was expected that his presence  wouldn't be acceptable to the ancient buffalo.
'    'To whom, Sir?' demanded Mr Abel.
    'To the old gentleman,' returned Mr Chuckster, slightly abashed.
    'Our client prefers to take him now,' said Mr Abel, drily.
  'There is  no longer any need for that precaution, as my father's relationship to  a gentleman in whom the objects of his search have full confidence,  will be a sufficient guarantee for the friendly nature of their errand.
'    'Ah!' thought Mr Chuckster, looking out of window, 'anybody but me!  Snobby before me, of course.
  He didn't happen to take that particular  five-pound note, but I have not the smallest doubt that he's always up  to something of that sort.
  I always said it, long before this came  out.
  Devilish pretty girl that!  'Pon my soul, an amazing little  creature!'    Barbara was the subject of Mr Chuckster's commendations; and as she was  lingering near the carriage (all being now ready for its departure),  that gentleman was suddenly seized with a strong interest in the  proceedings, which impelled him to swagger down the garden, and take up  his position at a convenient ogling distance.
  Having had great  experience of the sex, and being perfectly acquainted with all those  little artifices which find the readiest road to their hearts, Mr  Chuckster, on taking his ground, planted one hand on his hip, and with  the other adjusted his flowing hair.
  This is a favourite attitude in  the polite circles, and, accompanied with a graceful whistling, has  been known to do immense execution.
    Such, however, is the difference between town and country, that nobody  took the smallest notice of this insinuating figure; the wretches being  wholly engaged in bidding the travellers farewell, in kissing hands to  each other, waving handkerchiefs, and the like tame and vulgar  practices.
  For now the single gentleman and Mr Garland were in the  carriage, and the post-boy was in the saddle, and Kit, well wrapped and  muffled up, was in the rumble behind; and Mrs Garland was there, and Mr  Abel was there, and Kit's mother was there, and little Jacob was there,  and Barbara's mother was visible in remote perspective, nursing the  ever-wakeful baby; and all were nodding, beckoning, curtseying, or  crying out, 'Good bye!' with all the energy they could express.
  In  another minute, the carriage was out of sight; and Mr Chuckster  remained alone on the spot where it had lately been, with a vision of  Kit standing up in the rumble waving his hand to Barbara, and of  Barbara in the full light and lustre of his eyes--his  eyes--Chuckster's--Chuckster the successful--on whom ladies of quality  had looked with favour from phaetons in the parks on Sundays--waving  hers to Kit!    How Mr Chuckster, entranced by this monstrous fact, stood for some time  rooted to the earth, protesting within himself that Kit was the Prince  of felonious characters, and very Emperor or Great Mogul of Snobs, and  how he clearly traced this revolting circumstance back to that old  villany of the shilling, are matters foreign to our purpose; which is  to track the rolling wheels, and bear the travellers company on their  cold, bleak journey.
    It was a bitter day.
  A keen wind was blowing, and rushed against them  fiercely: bleaching the hard ground, shaking the white frost from the  trees and hedges, and whirling it away like dust.
  But little cared Kit  for weather.
  There was a freedom and freshness in the wind, as it came  howling by, which, let it cut never so sharp, was welcome.
  As it swept  on with its cloud of frost, bearing down the dry twigs and boughs and  withered leaves, and carrying them away pell-mell, it seemed as though  some general sympathy had got abroad, and everything was in a hurry,  like themselves.
  The harder the gusts, the better progress they  appeared to make.
  It was a good thing to go struggling and fighting  forward, vanquishing them one by one; to watch them driving up,  gathering strength and fury as they came along; to bend for a moment,  as they whistled past; and then to look back and see them speed away,  their hoarse noise dying in the distance, and the stout trees cowering  down before them.
    All day long, it blew without cessation.
  The night was clear and  starlit, but the wind had not fallen, and the cold was piercing.
  Sometimes--towards the end of a long stage--Kit could not help wishing  it were a little warmer: but when they stopped to change horses, and he  had had a good run, and what with that, and the bustle of paying the  old postilion, and rousing the new one, and running to and fro again  until the horses were put to, he was so warm that the blood tingled and  smarted in his fingers' ends--then, he felt as if to have it one  degree less cold would be to lose half the delight and glory of the  journey: and up he jumped again, right cheerily, singing to the merry  music of the wheels as they rolled away, and, leaving the townspeople  in their warm beds, pursued their course along the lonely road.
    Meantime the two gentlemen inside, who were little disposed to sleep,  beguiled the time with conversation.
  As both were anxious and  expectant, it naturally turned upon the subject of their expedition, on  the manner in which it had been brought about, and on the hopes and  fears they entertained respecting it.
  Of the former they had many, of  the latter few--none perhaps beyond that indefinable uneasiness which  is inseparable from suddenly awakened hope, and protracted expectation.
    In one of the pauses of their discourse, and when half the night had  worn away, the single gentleman, who had gradually become more and more  silent and thoughtful, turned to his companion and said abruptly:    'Are you a good listener?'    'Like most other men, I suppose,' returned Mr Garland, smiling.
  'I can  be, if I am interested; and if not interested, I should still try to  appear so.
  Why do you ask?'    'I have a short narrative on my lips,' rejoined his friend, 'and will  try you with it.
  It is very brief.
'    Pausing for no reply, he laid his hand on the old gentleman's sleeve,  and proceeded thus:    'There were once two brothers, who loved each other dearly.
  There was  a disparity in their ages--some twelve years.
  I am not sure but they  may insensibly have loved each other the better for that reason.
  Wide  as the interval between them was, however, they became rivals too soon.
  The deepest and strongest affection of both their hearts settled upon  one object.
    'The youngest--there were reasons for his being sensitive and  watchful--was the first to find this out.
  I will not tell you what  misery he underwent, what agony of soul he knew, how great his mental  struggle was.
  He had been a sickly child.
  His brother, patient and  considerate in the midst of his own high health and strength, had many  and many a day denied himself the sports he loved, to sit beside his  couch, telling him old stories till his pale face lighted up with an  unwonted glow; to carry him in his arms to some green spot, where he  could tend the poor pensive boy as he looked upon the bright summer  day, and saw all nature healthy but himself; to be, in any way, his  fond and faithful nurse.
  I may not dwell on all he did, to make the  poor, weak creature love him, or my tale would have no end.
  But when  the time of trial came, the younger brother's heart was full of those  old days.
  Heaven strengthened it to repay the sacrifices of  inconsiderate youth by one of thoughtful manhood.
  He left his brother  to be happy.
  The truth never passed his lips, and he quitted the  country, hoping to die abroad.
    'The elder brother married her.
  She was in Heaven before long, and  left him with an infant daughter.
    'If you have seen the picture-gallery of any one old family, you will  remember how the same face and figure--often the fairest and slightest  of them all--come upon you in different generations; and how you trace  the same sweet girl through a long line of portraits--never growing  old or changing--the Good Angel of the race--abiding by them in all  reverses--redeeming all their sins--    'In this daughter the mother lived again.
  You may judge with what  devotion he who lost that mother almost in the winning, clung to this  girl, her breathing image.
  She grew to womanhood, and gave her heart  to one who could not know its worth.
  Well!  Her fond father could not  see her pine and droop.
  He might be more deserving than he thought  him.
  He surely might become so, with a wife like her.
  He joined their  hands, and they were married.
    'Through all the misery that followed this union; through all the cold  neglect and undeserved reproach; through all the poverty he brought  upon her; through all the struggles of their daily life, too mean and  pitiful to tell, but dreadful to endure; she toiled on, in the deep  devotion of her spirit, and in her better nature, as only women can.
  Her means and substance wasted; her father nearly beggared by her  husband's hand, and the hourly witness (for they lived now under one  roof) of her ill-usage and unhappiness,--she never, but for him,  bewailed her fate.
  Patient, and upheld by strong affection to the  last, she died a widow of some three weeks' date, leaving to her  father's care two orphans; one a son of ten or twelve years old; the  other a girl--such another infant child--the same in helplessness, in  age, in form, in feature--as she had been herself when her young mother  died.
    'The elder brother, grandfather to these two children, was now a broken  man; crushed and borne down, less by the weight of years than by the  heavy hand of sorrow.
  With the wreck of his possessions, he began to  trade--in pictures first, and then in curious ancient things.
  He had  entertained a fondness for such matters from a boy, and the tastes he  had cultivated were now to yield him an anxious and precarious  subsistence.
    'The boy grew like his father in mind and person; the girl so like her  mother, that when the old man had her on his knee, and looked into her  mild blue eyes, he felt as if awakening from a wretched dream, and his  daughter were a little child again.
  The wayward boy soon spurned the  shelter of his roof, and sought associates more congenial to his taste.
  The old man and the child dwelt alone together.
    'It was then, when the love of two dead people who had been nearest and  dearest to his heart, was all transferred to this slight creature; when  her face, constantly before him, reminded him, from hour to hour, of  the too early change he had seen in such another--of all the  sufferings he had watched and known, and all his child had undergone;  when the young man's profligate and hardened course drained him of  money as his father's had, and even sometimes occasioned them temporary  privation and distress; it was then that there began to beset him, and  to be ever in his mind, a gloomy dread of poverty and want.
  He had no  thought for himself in this.
  His fear was for the child.
  It was a  spectre in his house, and haunted him night and day.
    'The younger brother had been a traveller in many countries, and had  made his pilgrimage through life alone.
  His voluntary banishment had  been misconstrued, and he had borne (not without pain) reproach and  slight for doing that which had wrung his heart, and cast a mournful  shadow on his path.
  Apart from this, communication between him and the  elder was difficult, and uncertain, and often failed; still, it was not  so wholly broken off but that he learnt--with long blanks and gaps  between each interval of information--all that I have told you now.
    'Then, dreams of their young, happy life--happy to him though laden  with pain and early care--visited his pillow yet oftener than before;  and every night, a boy again, he was at his brother's side.
  With the  utmost speed he could exert, he settled his affairs; converted into  money all the goods he had; and, with honourable wealth enough for  both, with open heart and hand, with limbs that trembled as they bore  him on, with emotion such as men can hardly bear and live, arrived one  evening at his brother's door!'    The narrator, whose voice had faltered lately, stopped.
    'The rest,' said Mr Garland, pressing his hand after a pause, 'I know.
'    'Yes,' rejoined his friend, 'we may spare ourselves the sequel.
  You  know the poor result of all my search.
  Even when by dint of such  inquiries as the utmost vigilance and sagacity could set on foot, we  found they had been seen with two poor travelling showmen--and in time  discovered the men themselves--and in time, the actual place of their  retreat; even then, we were too late.
  Pray God, we are not too late  again!'    'We cannot be,' said Mr Garland.
  'This time we must succeed.
'    'I have believed and hoped so,' returned the other.
  'I try to believe  and hope so still.
  But a heavy weight has fallen on my spirits, my  good friend, and the sadness that gathers over me, will yield to  neither hope nor reason.
'    'That does not surprise me,' said Mr Garland; 'it is a natural  consequence of the events you have recalled; of this dreary time and  place; and above all, of this wild and dismal night.
  A dismal night,  indeed!  Hark! how the wind is howling!'              Day broke, and found them still upon their way.
  Since leaving home,  they had halted here and there for necessary refreshment, and had  frequently been delayed, especially in the night time, by waiting for  fresh horses.
  They had made no other stoppages, but the weather  continued rough, and the roads were often steep and heavy.
  It would be  night again before they reached their place of destination.
    Kit, all bluff and hardened with the cold, went on manfully; and,  having enough to do to keep his blood circulating, to picture to  himself the happy end of this adventurous journey, and to look about  him and be amazed at everything, had little spare time for thinking of  discomforts.
  Though his impatience, and that of his fellow-travellers,  rapidly increased as the day waned, the hours did not stand still.
  The  short daylight of winter soon faded away, and it was dark again when  they had yet many miles to travel.
    As it grew dusk, the wind fell; its distant moanings were more low and  mournful; and, as it came creeping up the road, and rattling covertly  among the dry brambles on either hand, it seemed like some great  phantom for whom the way was narrow, whose garments rustled as it  stalked along.
  By degrees it lulled and died away, and then it came on  to snow.
    The flakes fell fast and thick, soon covering the ground some inches  deep, and spreading abroad a solemn stillness.
  The rolling wheels were  noiseless, and the sharp ring and clatter of the horses' hoofs, became  a dull, muffled tramp.
  The life of their progress seemed to be slowly  hushed, and something death-like to usurp its place.
    Shading his eyes from the falling snow, which froze upon their lashes  and obscured his sight, Kit often tried to catch the earliest glimpse  of twinkling lights, denoting their approach to some not distant town.
  He could descry objects enough at such times, but none correctly.
  Now,  a tall church spire appeared in view, which presently became a tree, a  barn, a shadow on the ground, thrown on it by their own bright lamps.
  Now, there were horsemen, foot-passengers, carriages, going on before,  or meeting them in narrow ways; which, when they were close upon them,  turned to shadows too.
  A wall, a ruin, a sturdy gable end, would rise  up in the road; and, when they were plunging headlong at it, would be  the road itself.
  Strange turnings too, bridges, and sheets of water,  appeared to start up here and there, making the way doubtful and  uncertain; and yet they were on the same bare road, and these things,  like the others, as they were passed, turned into dim illusions.
    He descended slowly from his seat--for his limbs were numbed--when  they arrived at a lone posting-house, and inquired how far they had to  go to reach their journey's end.
  It was a late hour in such by-places,  and the people were abed; but a voice answered from an upper window,  Ten miles.
  The ten minutes that ensued appeared an hour; but at the  end of that time, a shivering figure led out the horses they required,  and after another brief delay they were again in motion.
    It was a cross-country road, full, after the first three or four miles,  of holes and cart-ruts, which, being covered by the snow, were so many  pitfalls to the trembling horses, and obliged them to keep a footpace.
  As it was next to impossible for men so much agitated as they were by  this time, to sit still and move so slowly, all three got out and  plodded on behind the carriage.
  The distance seemed interminable, and  the walk was most laborious.
  As each was thinking within himself that  the driver must have lost his way, a church bell, close at hand, struck  the hour of midnight, and the carriage stopped.
  It had moved softly  enough, but when it ceased to crunch the snow, the silence was as  startling as if some great noise had been replaced by perfect stillness.
    'This is the place, gentlemen,' said the driver, dismounting from his  horse, and knocking at the door of a little inn.
  'Halloa!  Past twelve  o'clock is the dead of night here.
'    The knocking was loud and long, but it failed to rouse the drowsy  inmates.
  All continued dark and silent as before.
  They fell back a  little, and looked up at the windows, which were mere black patches in  the whitened house front.
  No light appeared.
  The house might have  been deserted, or the sleepers dead, for any air of life it had about  it.
    They spoke together with a strange inconsistency, in whispers;  unwilling to disturb again the dreary echoes they had just now raised.
    'Let us go on,' said the younger brother, 'and leave this good fellow  to wake them, if he can.
  I cannot rest until I know that we are not  too late.
  Let us go on, in the name of Heaven!'    They did so, leaving the postilion to order such accommodation as the  house afforded, and to renew his knocking.
  Kit accompanied them with a  little bundle, which he had hung in the carriage when they left home,  and had not forgotten since--the bird in his old cage--just as she had  left him.
  She would be glad to see her bird, he knew.
    The road wound gently downward.
  As they proceeded, they lost sight of  the church whose clock they had heard, and of the small village  clustering round it.
  The knocking, which was now renewed, and which in  that stillness they could plainly hear, troubled them.
  They wished the  man would forbear, or that they had told him not to break the silence  until they returned.
    The old church tower, clad in a ghostly garb of pure cold white, again  rose up before them, and a few moments brought them close beside it.
  A  venerable building--grey, even in the midst of the hoary landscape.
  An  ancient sun-dial on the belfry wall was nearly hidden by the  snow-drift, and scarcely to be known for what it was.
  Time itself  seemed to have grown dull and old, as if no day were ever to displace  the melancholy night.
    A wicket gate was close at hand, but there was more than one path  across the churchyard to which it led, and, uncertain which to take,  they came to a stand again.
    The village street--if street that could be called which was an  irregular cluster of poor cottages of many heights and ages, some with  their fronts, some with their backs, and some with gable ends towards  the road, with here and there a signpost, or a shed encroaching on the  path--was close at hand.
  There was a faint light in a chamber window  not far off, and Kit ran towards that house to ask their way.
    His first shout was answered by an old man within, who presently  appeared at the casement, wrapping some garment round his throat as a  protection from the cold, and demanded who was abroad at that  unseasonable hour, wanting him.
    ''Tis hard weather this,' he grumbled, 'and not a night to call me up  in.
  My trade is not of that kind that I need be roused from bed.
  The  business on which folks want me, will keep cold, especially at this  season.
  What do you want?'    'I would not have roused you, if I had known you were old and ill,'  said Kit.
    'Old!' repeated the other peevishly.
  'How do you know I am old?  Not  so old as you think, friend, perhaps.
  As to being ill, you will find  many young people in worse case than I am.
  More's the pity that it  should be so--not that I should be strong and hearty for my years, I  mean, but that they should be weak and tender.
  I ask your pardon  though,' said the old man, 'if I spoke rather rough at first.
  My eyes  are not good at night--that's neither age nor illness; they never  were--and I didn't see you were a stranger.
'    'I am sorry to call you from your bed,' said Kit, 'but those gentlemen  you may see by the churchyard gate, are strangers too, who have just  arrived from a long journey, and seek the parsonage-house.
  You can  direct us?'    'I should be able to,' answered the old man, in a trembling voice,  'for, come next summer, I have been sexton here, good fifty years.
  The  right hand path, friend, is the road.
--There is no ill news for our  good gentleman, I hope?'    Kit thanked him, and made him a hasty answer in the negative; he was  turning back, when his attention was caught by the voice of a child.
  Looking up, he saw a very little creature at a neighbouring window.
    'What is that?' cried the child, earnestly.
  'Has my dream come true?  Pray speak to me, whoever that is, awake and up.
'    'Poor boy!' said the sexton, before Kit could answer, 'how goes it,  darling?'    'Has my dream come true?' exclaimed the child again, in a  voice so fervent that it might have thrilled to the heart of any  listener.
  'But no, that can never be!  How could it be--Oh! how could  it!'    'I guess his meaning,' said the sexton.
  'To bed again, poor boy!'    'Ay!' cried the child, in a burst of despair.
  'I knew it could never  be, I felt too sure of that, before I asked!  But, all to-night, and  last night too, it was the same.
  I never fall asleep, but that cruel  dream comes back.
'    'Try to sleep again,' said the old man, soothingly.
  'It will go in  time.
'    'No no, I would rather that it staid--cruel as it is, I would rather  that it staid,' rejoined the child.
  'I am not afraid to have it in my  sleep, but I am so sad--so very, very sad.
'    The old man blessed him, the child in tears replied Good night, and Kit  was again alone.
    He hurried back, moved by what he had heard, though more by the child's  manner than by anything he had said, as his meaning was hidden from  him.
  They took the path indicated by the sexton, and soon arrived  before the parsonage wall.
  Turning round to look about them when they  had got thus far, they saw, among some ruined buildings at a distance,  one single solitary light.
    It shone from what appeared to be an old oriel window, and being  surrounded by the deep shadows of overhanging walls, sparkled like a  star.
  Bright and glimmering as the stars above their heads, lonely and  motionless as they, it seemed to claim some kindred with the eternal  lamps of Heaven, and to burn in fellowship with them.
    'What light is that!' said the younger brother.
    'It is surely,' said Mr Garland, 'in the ruin where they live.
  I see  no other ruin hereabouts.
'    'They cannot,' returned the brother hastily, 'be waking at this late  hour--'    Kit interposed directly, and begged that, while they rang and waited at  the gate, they would let him make his way to where this light was  shining, and try to ascertain if any people were about.
  Obtaining the  permission he desired, he darted off with breathless eagerness, and,  still carrying the birdcage in his hand, made straight towards the spot.
    It was not easy to hold that pace among the graves, and at another time  he might have gone more slowly, or round by the path.
  Unmindful of all  obstacles, however, he pressed forward without slackening his speed,  and soon arrived within a few yards of the window.
  He approached as  softly as he could, and advancing so near the wall as to brush the  whitened ivy with his dress, listened.
  There was no sound inside.
  The  church itself was not more quiet.
  Touching the glass with his cheek,  he listened again.
  No.
  And yet there was such a silence all around,  that he felt sure he could have heard even the breathing of a sleeper,  if there had been one there.
    A strange circumstance, a light in such a place at that time of night,  with no one near it.
    A curtain was drawn across the lower portion of the window, and he  could not see into the room.
  But there was no shadow thrown upon it  from within.
  To have gained a footing on the wall and tried to look in  from above, would have been attended with some danger--certainly with  some noise, and the chance of terrifying the child, if that really were  her habitation.
  Again and again he listened; again and again the same  wearisome blank.
    Leaving the spot with slow and cautious steps, and skirting the ruin  for a few paces, he came at length to a door.
  He knocked.
  No answer.
  But there was a curious noise inside.
  It was difficult to determine  what it was.
  It bore a resemblance to the low moaning of one in pain,  but it was not that, being far too regular and constant.
  Now it seemed  a kind of song, now a wail--seemed, that is, to his changing fancy, for  the sound itself was never changed or checked.
  It was unlike anything  he had ever heard; and in its tone there was something fearful,  chilling, and unearthly.
    The listener's blood ran colder now than ever it had done in frost and  snow, but he knocked again.
  There was no answer, and the sound went on  without any interruption.
  He laid his hand softly upon the latch, and  put his knee against the door.
  It was secured on the inside, but  yielded to the pressure, and turned upon its hinges.
  He saw the  glimmering of a fire upon the old walls, and entered.
              The dull, red glow of a wood fire--for no lamp or candle burnt within  the room--showed him a figure, seated on the hearth with its back  towards him, bending over the fitful light.
  The attitude was that of  one who sought the heat.
  It was, and yet was not.
  The stooping  posture and the cowering form were there, but no hands were stretched  out to meet the grateful warmth, no shrug or shiver compared its luxury  with the piercing cold outside.
  With limbs huddled together, head  bowed down, arms crossed upon the breast, and fingers tightly clenched,  it rocked to and fro upon its seat without a moment's pause,  accompanying the action with the mournful sound he had heard.
    The heavy door had closed behind him on his entrance, with a crash that  made him start.
  The figure neither spoke, nor turned to look, nor gave  in any other way the faintest sign of having heard the noise.
  The form  was that of an old man, his white head akin in colour to the mouldering  embers upon which he gazed.
  He, and the failing light and dying fire,  the time-worn room, the solitude, the wasted life, and gloom, were all  in fellowship.
  Ashes, and dust, and ruin!    Kit tried to speak, and did pronounce some words, though what they were  he scarcely knew.
  Still the same terrible low cry went on--still the  same rocking in the chair--the same stricken figure was there,  unchanged and heedless of his presence.
    He had his hand upon the latch, when something in the form--distinctly  seen as one log broke and fell, and, as it fell, blazed up--arrested  it.
  He returned to where he had stood before--advanced a  pace--another--another still.
  Another, and he saw the face.
  Yes!  Changed as it was, he knew it well.
    'Master!' he cried, stooping on one knee and catching at his hand.
  'Dear master.
  Speak to me!'    The old man turned slowly towards him; and muttered in a hollow voice,    'This is another!--How many of these spirits there have been to-night!'    'No spirit, master.
  No one but your old servant.
  You know me now, I  am sure?  Miss Nell--where is she--where is she?'    'They all say that!' cried the old man.
  'They all ask the same  question.
  A spirit!'    'Where is she?' demanded Kit.
  'Oh tell me but that,--but that, dear  master!'    'She is asleep--yonder--in there.
'    'Thank God!'    'Aye!  Thank God!' returned the old man.
  'I have prayed to Him, many,  and many, and many a livelong night, when she has been asleep, He  knows.
  Hark!  Did she call?'    'I heard no voice.
'    'You did.
  You hear her now.
  Do you tell me that you don't hear THAT?'    He started up, and listened again.
    'Nor that?' he cried, with a triumphant smile, 'Can any body know that  voice so well as I?  Hush!  Hush!'    Motioning to him to be silent, he stole away into another chamber.
  After a short absence (during which he could be heard to speak in a  softened soothing tone) he returned, bearing in his hand a lamp.
    'She is still asleep,' he whispered.
  'You were right.
  She did not  call--unless she did so in her slumber.
  She has called to me in her  sleep before now, sir; as I have sat by, watching, I have seen her lips  move, and have known, though no sound came from them, that she spoke of  me.
  I feared the light might dazzle her eyes and wake her, so I  brought it here.
'    He spoke rather to himself than to the visitor, but when he had put the  lamp upon the table, he took it up, as if impelled by some momentary  recollection or curiosity, and held it near his face.
  Then, as if  forgetting his motive in the very action, he turned away and put it  down again.
    'She is sleeping soundly,' he said; 'but no wonder.
  Angel hands have  strewn the ground deep with snow, that the lightest footstep may be  lighter yet; and the very birds are dead, that they may not wake her.
  She used to feed them, Sir.
  Though never so cold and hungry, the timid  things would fly from us.
  They never flew from her!'    Again he stopped to listen, and scarcely drawing breath, listened for a  long, long time.
  That fancy past, he opened an old chest, took out  some clothes as fondly as if they had been living things, and began to  smooth and brush them with his hand.
    'Why dost thou lie so idle there, dear Nell,' he murmured, 'when there  are bright red berries out of doors waiting for thee to pluck them!  Why dost thou lie so idle there, when thy little friends come creeping  to the door, crying "where is Nell--sweet Nell?"--and sob, and weep,  because they do not see thee.
  She was always gentle with children.
  The wildest would do her bidding--she had a tender way with them,  indeed she had!'    Kit had no power to speak.
  His eyes were filled with tears.
    'Her little homely dress,--her favourite!' cried the old man, pressing  it to his breast, and patting it with his shrivelled hand.
  'She will  miss it when she wakes.
  They have hid it here in sport, but she shall  have it--she shall have it.
  I would not vex my darling, for the wide  world's riches.
  See here--these shoes--how worn they are--she kept  them to remind her of our last long journey.
  You see where the little  feet went bare upon the ground.
  They told me, afterwards, that the  stones had cut and bruised them.
  She never told me that.
  No, no, God  bless her! and, I have remembered since, she walked behind me, sir,  that I might not see how lame she was--but yet she had my hand in hers,  and seemed to lead me still.
'    He pressed them to his lips, and having carefully put them back again,  went on communing with himself--looking wistfully from time to time  towards the chamber he had lately visited.
    'She was not wont to be a lie-abed; but she was well then.
  We must  have patience.
  When she is well again, she will rise early, as she  used to do, and ramble abroad in the healthy morning time.
  I often  tried to track the way she had gone, but her small footstep left no  print upon the dewy ground, to guide me.
  Who is that?  Shut the door.
  Quick!--Have we not enough to do to drive away that marble cold, and  keep her warm!'    The door was indeed opened, for the entrance of Mr Garland and his  friend, accompanied by two other persons.
  These were the schoolmaster,  and the bachelor.
  The former held a light in his hand.
  He had, it  seemed, but gone to his own cottage to replenish the exhausted lamp, at  the moment when Kit came up and found the old man alone.
    He softened again at sight of these two friends, and, laying aside the  angry manner--if to anything so feeble and so sad the term can be  applied--in which he had spoken when the door opened, resumed his  former seat, and subsided, by little and little into the old action,  and the old, dull, wandering sound.
    Of the strangers, he took no heed whatever.
  He had seen them, but  appeared quite incapable of interest or curiosity.
  The younger brother  stood apart.
  The bachelor drew a chair towards the old man, and sat  down close beside him.
  After a long silence, he ventured to speak.
    'Another night, and not in bed!' he said softly; 'I hoped you would be  more mindful of your promise to me.
  Why do you not take some rest?'    'Sleep has left me,' returned the old man.
  'It is all with her!'    'It would pain her very much to know that you were watching thus,' said  the bachelor.
  'You would not give her pain?'    'I am not so sure of that, if it would only rouse her.
  She has slept  so very long.
  And yet I am rash to say so.
  It is a good and happy  sleep--eh?'    'Indeed it is,' returned the bachelor.
  'Indeed, indeed, it is!'    'That's well!--and the waking--' faltered the old man.
    'Happy too.
  Happier than tongue can tell, or heart of man conceive.
'    They watched him as he rose and stole on tiptoe to the other chamber  where the lamp had been replaced.
  They listened as he spoke again  within its silent walls.
  They looked into the faces of each other, and  no man's cheek was free from tears.
  He came back, whispering that she  was still asleep, but that he thought she had moved.
  It was her hand,  he said--a little--a very, very little--but he was pretty sure she had  moved it--perhaps in seeking his.
  He had known her do that, before  now, though in the deepest sleep the while.
  And when he had said this,  he dropped into his chair again, and clasping his hands above his head,  uttered a cry never to be forgotten.
    The poor schoolmaster motioned to the bachelor that he would come on  the other side, and speak to him.
  They gently unlocked his fingers,  which he had twisted in his grey hair, and pressed them in their own.
    'He will hear me,' said the schoolmaster, 'I am sure.
  He will hear  either me or you if we beseech him.
  She would, at all times.
'    'I will hear any voice she liked to hear,' cried the old man.
  'I love  all she loved!'    'I know you do,' returned the schoolmaster.
  'I am certain of it.
  Think of her; think of all the sorrows and afflictions you have shared  together; of all the trials, and all the peaceful pleasures, you have  jointly known.
'    'I do.
  I do.
  I think of nothing else.
'    'I would have you think of nothing else to-night--of nothing but those  things which will soften your heart, dear friend, and open it to old  affections and old times.
  It is so that she would speak to you  herself, and in her name it is that I speak now.
'    'You do well to speak softly,' said the old man.
  'We will not wake  her.
  I should be glad to see her eyes again, and to see her smile.
  There is a smile upon her young face now, but it is fixed and  changeless.
  I would have it come and go.
  That shall be in Heaven's  good time.
  We will not wake her.
'    'Let us not talk of her in her sleep, but as she used to be when you  were journeying together, far away--as she was at home, in the old  house from which you fled together--as she was, in the old cheerful  time,' said the schoolmaster.
    'She was always cheerful--very cheerful,' cried the old man, looking  steadfastly at him.
  'There was ever something mild and quiet about  her, I remember, from the first; but she was of a happy nature.
'    'We have heard you say,' pursued the schoolmaster, 'that in this and in  all goodness, she was like her mother.
  You can think of, and remember  her?'    He maintained his steadfast look, but gave no answer.
    'Or even one before her,' said the bachelor.
  'It is many years ago,  and affliction makes the time longer, but you have not forgotten her  whose death contributed to make this child so dear to you, even before  you knew her worth or could read her heart?  Say, that you could carry  back your thoughts to very distant days--to the time of your early  life--when, unlike this fair flower, you did not pass your youth alone.
  Say, that you could remember, long ago, another child who loved you  dearly, you being but a child yourself.
  Say, that you had a brother,  long forgotten, long unseen, long separated from you, who now, at last,  in your utmost need came back to comfort and console you--'    'To be to you what you were once to him,' cried the younger, falling on  his knee before him; 'to repay your old affection, brother dear, by  constant care, solicitude, and love; to be, at your right hand, what he  has never ceased to be when oceans rolled between us; to call to  witness his unchanging truth and mindfulness of bygone days, whole  years of desolation.
  Give me but one word of recognition, brother--and  never--no never, in the brightest moment of our youngest days, when,  poor silly boys, we thought to pass our lives together--have we been  half as dear and precious to each other as we shall be from this time  hence!'    The old man looked from face to face, and his lips moved; but no sound  came from them in reply.
    'If we were knit together then,' pursued the younger brother, 'what  will be the bond between us now!  Our love and fellowship began in  childhood, when life was all before us, and will be resumed when we  have proved it, and are but children at the last.
  As many restless  spirits, who have hunted fortune, fame, or pleasure through the world,  retire in their decline to where they first drew breath, vainly seeking  to be children once again before they die, so we, less fortunate than  they in early life, but happier in its closing scenes, will set up our  rest again among our boyish haunts, and going home with no hope  realised, that had its growth in manhood--carrying back nothing that  we brought away, but our old yearnings to each other--saving no  fragment from the wreck of life, but that which first endeared it--may  be, indeed, but children as at first.
  And even,' he added in an  altered voice, 'even if what I dread to name has come to pass--even if  that be so, or is to be (which Heaven forbid and spare us!)--still,  dear brother, we are not apart, and have that comfort in our great  affliction.
'    By little and little, the old man had drawn back towards the inner  chamber, while these words were spoken.
  He pointed there, as he  replied, with trembling lips.
    'You plot among you to wean my heart from her.
  You never will do  that--never while I have life.
  I have no relative or friend but her--I  never had--I never will have.
  She is all in all to me.
  It is too late  to part us now.
'    Waving them off with his hand, and calling softly to her as he went, he  stole into the room.
  They who were left behind, drew close together,  and after a few whispered words--not unbroken by emotion, or easily  uttered--followed him.
  They moved so gently, that their footsteps made  no noise; but there were sobs from among the group, and sounds of grief  and mourning.
    For she was dead.
  There, upon her little bed, she lay at rest.
  The  solemn stillness was no marvel now.
    She was dead.
  No sleep so beautiful and calm, so free from trace of  pain, so fair to look upon.
  She seemed a creature fresh from the hand  of God, and waiting for the breath of life; not one who had lived and  suffered death.
    Her couch was dressed with here and there some winter berries and green  leaves, gathered in a spot she had been used to favour.
  'When I die,  put near me something that has loved the light, and had the sky above  it always.
'  Those were her words.
    She was dead.
  Dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell was dead.
  Her little  bird--a poor slight thing the pressure of a finger would have  crushed--was stirring nimbly in its cage; and the strong heart of its  child mistress was mute and motionless for ever.
    Where were the traces of her early cares, her sufferings, and fatigues?  All gone.
  Sorrow was dead indeed in her, but peace and perfect  happiness were born; imaged in her tranquil beauty and profound repose.
    And still her former self lay there, unaltered in this change.
  Yes.
  The old fireside had smiled upon that same sweet face; it had passed,  like a dream, through haunts of misery and care; at the door of the  poor schoolmaster on the summer evening, before the furnace fire upon  the cold wet night, at the still bedside of the dying boy, there had  been the same mild lovely look.
  So shall we know the angels in their  majesty, after death.
    The old man held one languid arm in his, and had the small hand tight  folded to his breast, for warmth.
  It was the hand she had stretched  out to him with her last smile--the hand that had led him on, through  all their wanderings.
  Ever and anon he pressed it to his lips; then  hugged it to his breast again, murmuring that it was warmer now; and,  as he said it, he looked, in agony, to those who stood around, as if  imploring them to help her.
    She was dead, and past all help, or need of it.
  The ancient rooms she  had seemed to fill with life, even while her own was waning fast--the  garden she had tended--the eyes she had gladdened--the noiseless haunts  of many a thoughtful hour--the paths she had trodden as it were but  yesterday--could know her never more.
    'It is not,' said the schoolmaster, as he bent down to kiss her on the  cheek, and gave his tears free vent, 'it is not on earth that Heaven's  justice ends.
  Think what earth is, compared with the World to which  her young spirit has winged its early flight; and say, if one  deliberate wish expressed in solemn terms above this bed could call her  back to life, which of us would utter it!'              When morning came, and they could speak more calmly on the subject of  their grief, they heard how her life had closed.
    She had been dead two days.
  They were all about her at the time,  knowing that the end was drawing on.
  She died soon after daybreak.
  They had read and talked to her in the earlier portion of the night,  but as the hours crept on, she sunk to sleep.
  They could tell, by what  she faintly uttered in her dreams, that they were of her journeyings  with the old man; they were of no painful scenes, but of people who had  helped and used them kindly, for she often said 'God bless you!' with  great fervour.
  Waking, she never wandered in her mind but once, and  that was of beautiful music which she said was in the air.
  God knows.
  It may have been.
    Opening her eyes at last, from a very quiet sleep, she begged that they  would kiss her once again.
  That done, she turned to the old man with a  lovely smile upon her face--such, they said, as they had never seen,  and never could forget--and clung with both her arms about his neck.
  They did not know that she was dead, at first.
    She had spoken very often of the two sisters, who, she said, were like  dear friends to her.
  She wished they could be told how much she  thought about them, and how she had watched them as they walked  together, by the river side at night.
  She would like to see poor Kit,  she had often said of late.
  She wished there was somebody to take her  love to Kit.
  And, even then, she never thought or spoke about him, but  with something of her old, clear, merry laugh.
    For the rest, she had never murmured or complained; but with a quiet  mind, and manner quite unaltered--save that she every day became more  earnest and more grateful to them--faded like the light upon a summer's  evening.
    The child who had been her little friend came there, almost as soon as  it was day, with an offering of dried flowers which he begged them to  lay upon her breast.
  It was he who had come to the window overnight  and spoken to the sexton, and they saw in the snow traces of small  feet, where he had been lingering near the room in which she lay,  before he went to bed.
  He had a fancy, it seemed, that they had left  her there alone; and could not bear the thought.
    He told them of his dream again, and that it was of her being restored  to them, just as she used to be.
  He begged hard to see her, saying  that he would be very quiet, and that they need not fear his being  alarmed, for he had sat alone by his young brother all day long when he  was dead, and had felt glad to be so near him.
  They let him have his  wish; and indeed he kept his word, and was, in his childish way, a  lesson to them all.
    Up to that time, the old man had not spoken once--except to her--or  stirred from the bedside.
  But, when he saw her little favourite, he  was moved as they had not seen him yet, and made as though he would  have him come nearer.
  Then, pointing to the bed, he burst into tears  for the first time, and they who stood by, knowing that the sight of  this child had done him good, left them alone together.
    Soothing him with his artless talk of her, the child persuaded him to  take some rest, to walk abroad, to do almost as he desired him.
  And  when the day came on, which must remove her in her earthly shape from  earthly eyes for ever, he led him away, that he might not know when she  was taken from him.
    They were to gather fresh leaves and berries for her bed.
  It was  Sunday--a bright, clear, wintry afternoon--and as they traversed the  village street, those who were walking in their path drew back to make  way for them, and gave them a softened greeting.
  Some shook the old  man kindly by the hand, some stood uncovered while he tottered by, and  many cried 'God help him!' as he passed along.
    'Neighbour!' said the old man, stopping at the cottage where his young  guide's mother dwelt, 'how is it that the folks are nearly all in black  to-day?  I have seen a mourning ribbon or a piece of crape on almost  every one.
'    She could not tell, the woman said.
    'Why, you yourself--you wear the colour too?' he said.
  'Windows are  closed that never used to be by day.
  What does this mean?'    Again the woman said she could not tell.
    'We must go back,' said the old man, hurriedly.
  'We must see what this  is.
'    'No, no,' cried the child, detaining him.
  'Remember what you promised.
  Our way is to the old green lane, where she and I so often were, and  where you found us, more than once, making those garlands for her  garden.
  Do not turn back!'    'Where is she now?' said the old man.
  'Tell me that.
'    'Do you not know?' returned the child.
  'Did we not leave her, but just  now?'    'True.
  True.
  It was her we left--was it?'    He pressed his hand upon his brow, looked vacantly round, and as if  impelled by a sudden thought, crossed the road, and entered the  sexton's house.
  He and his deaf assistant were sitting before the  fire.
  Both rose up, on seeing who it was.
    The child made a hasty sign to them with his hand.
  It was the action  of an instant, but that, and the old man's look, were quite enough.
    'Do you--do you bury any one to-day?' he said, eagerly.
    'No, no!  Who should we bury, Sir?' returned the sexton.
    'Aye, who indeed!  I say with you, who indeed!'    'It is a holiday with us, good Sir,' returned the sexton mildly.
  'We  have no work to do to-day.
'    'Why then, I'll go where you will,' said the old man, turning to the  child.
  'You're sure of what you tell me?  You would not deceive me?  I  am changed, even in the little time since you last saw me.
'    'Go thy ways with him, Sir,' cried the sexton, 'and Heaven be with ye  both!'    'I am quite ready,' said the old man, meekly.
  'Come, boy, come--' and  so submitted to be led away.
    And now the bell--the bell she had so often heard, by night and day,  and listened to with solemn pleasure almost as a living voice--rung  its remorseless toll, for her, so young, so beautiful, so good.
  Decrepit age, and vigorous life, and blooming youth, and helpless  infancy, poured forth--on crutches, in the pride of strength and  health, in the full blush of promise, in the mere dawn of life--to  gather round her tomb.
  Old men were there, whose eyes were dim and  senses failing--grandmothers, who might have died ten years ago, and  still been old--the deaf, the blind, the lame, the palsied, the living  dead in many shapes and forms, to see the closing of that early grave.
  What was the death it would shut in, to that which still could crawl  and creep above it!    Along the crowded path they bore her now; pure as the newly-fallen snow  that covered it; whose day on earth had been as fleeting.
  Under the  porch, where she had sat when Heaven in its mercy brought her to that  peaceful spot, she passed again; and the old church received her in its  quiet shade.
    They carried her to one old nook, where she had many and many a time  sat musing, and laid their burden softly on the pavement.
  The light  streamed on it through the coloured window--a window, where the boughs  of trees were ever rustling in the summer, and where the birds sang  sweetly all day long.
  With every breath of air that stirred among  those branches in the sunshine, some trembling, changing light, would  fall upon her grave.
    Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust!  Many a young hand  dropped in its little wreath, many a stifled sob was heard.
  Some--and  they were not a few--knelt down.
  All were sincere and truthful in  their sorrow.
    The service done, the mourners stood apart, and the villagers closed  round to look into the grave before the pavement-stone should be  replaced.
  One called to mind how he had seen her sitting on that very  spot, and how her book had fallen on her lap, and she was gazing with a  pensive face upon the sky.
  Another told, how he had wondered much that  one so delicate as she, should be so bold; how she had never feared to  enter the church alone at night, but had loved to linger there when all  was quiet, and even to climb the tower stair, with no more light than  that of the moon rays stealing through the loopholes in the thick old  wall.
  A whisper went about among the oldest, that she had seen and  talked with angels; and when they called to mind how she had looked,  and spoken, and her early death, some thought it might be so, indeed.
  Thus, coming to the grave in little knots, and glancing down, and  giving place to others, and falling off in whispering groups of three  or four, the church was cleared in time, of all but the sexton and the  mourning friends.
    They saw the vault covered, and the stone fixed down.
  Then, when the  dusk of evening had come on, and not a sound disturbed the sacred  stillness of the place--when the bright moon poured in her light on  tomb and monument, on pillar, wall, and arch, and most of all (it  seemed to them) upon her quiet grave--in that calm time, when outward  things and inward thoughts teem with assurances of immortality, and  worldly hopes and fears are humbled in the dust before them--then, with  tranquil and submissive hearts they turned away, and left the child  with God.
    Oh! it is hard to take to heart the lesson that such deaths will teach,  but let no man reject it, for it is one that all must learn, and is a  mighty, universal Truth.
  When Death strikes down the innocent and  young, for every fragile form from which he lets the panting spirit  free, a hundred virtues rise, in shapes of mercy, charity, and love, to  walk the world, and bless it.
  Of every tear that sorrowing mortals  shed on such green graves, some good is born, some gentler nature  comes.
  In the Destroyer's steps there spring up bright creations that  defy his power, and his dark path becomes a way of light to Heaven.
    It was late when the old man came home.
  The boy had led him to his own  dwelling, under some pretence, on their way back; and, rendered drowsy  by his long ramble and late want of rest, he had sunk into a deep sleep  by the fireside.
  He was perfectly exhausted, and they were careful not  to rouse him.
  The slumber held him a long time, and when he at length  awoke the moon was shining.
    The younger brother, uneasy at his protracted absence, was watching at  the door for his coming, when he appeared in the pathway with his  little guide.
  He advanced to meet them, and tenderly obliging the old  man to lean upon his arm, conducted him with slow and trembling steps  towards the house.
    He repaired to her chamber, straight.
  Not finding what he had left  there, he returned with distracted looks to the room in which they were  assembled.
  From that, he rushed into the schoolmaster's cottage,  calling her name.
  They followed close upon him, and when he had vainly  searched it, brought him home.
    With such persuasive words as pity and affection could suggest, they  prevailed upon him to sit among them and hear what they should tell  him.
  Then endeavouring by every little artifice to prepare his mind  for what must come, and dwelling with many fervent words upon the happy  lot to which she had been removed, they told him, at last, the truth.
  The moment it had passed their lips, he fell down among them like a  murdered man.
    For many hours, they had little hope of his surviving; but grief is  strong, and he recovered.
    If there be any who have never known the blank that follows death--the  weary void--the sense of desolation that will come upon the strongest  minds, when something familiar and beloved is missed at every turn--the  connection between inanimate and senseless things, and the object of  recollection, when every household god becomes a monument and every  room a grave--if there be any who have not known this, and proved it by  their own experience, they can never faintly guess how, for many days,  the old man pined and moped away the time, and wandered here and there  as seeking something, and had no comfort.
    Whatever power of thought or memory he retained, was all bound up in  her.
  He never understood, or seemed to care to understand, about his  brother.
  To every endearment and attention he continued listless.
  If  they spoke to him on this, or any other theme--save one--he would hear  them patiently for awhile, then turn away, and go on seeking as before.
    On that one theme, which was in his and all their minds, it was  impossible to touch.
  Dead!  He could not hear or bear the word.
  The  slightest hint of it would throw him into a paroxysm, like that he had  had when it was first spoken.
  In what hope he lived, no man could  tell; but that he had some hope of finding her again--some faint and  shadowy hope, deferred from day to day, and making him from day to day  more sick and sore at heart--was plain to all.
    They bethought them of a removal from the scene of this last sorrow; of  trying whether change of place would rouse or cheer him.
  His brother  sought the advice of those who were accounted skilful in such matters,  and they came and saw him.
  Some of the number staid upon the spot,  conversed with him when he would converse, and watched him as he  wandered up and down, alone and silent.
  Move him where they might,  they said, he would ever seek to get back there.
  His mind would run  upon that spot.
  If they confined him closely, and kept a strict guard  upon him, they might hold him prisoner, but if he could by any means  escape, he would surely wander back to that place, or die upon the road.
    The boy, to whom he had submitted at first, had no longer any influence  with him.
  At times he would suffer the child to walk by his side, or  would even take such notice of his presence as giving him his hand, or  would stop to kiss his cheek, or pat him on the head.
  At other times,  he would entreat him--not unkindly--to be gone, and would not brook him  near.
  But, whether alone, or with this pliant friend, or with those  who would have given him, at any cost or sacrifice, some consolation or  some peace of mind, if happily the means could have been devised; he  was at all times the same--with no love or care for anything in life--a  broken-hearted man.
    At length, they found, one day, that he had risen early, and, with his  knapsack on his back, his staff in hand, her own straw hat, and little  basket full of such things as she had been used to carry, was gone.
  As  they were making ready to pursue him far and wide, a frightened  schoolboy came who had seen him, but a moment before, sitting in the  church--upon her grave, he said.
    They hastened there, and going softly to the door, espied him in the  attitude of one who waited patiently.
  They did not disturb him then,  but kept a watch upon him all that day.
  When it grew quite dark, he  rose and returned home, and went to bed, murmuring to himself, 'She  will come to-morrow!'    Upon the morrow he was there again from sunrise until night; and still  at night he laid him down to rest, and murmured, 'She will come  to-morrow!'    And thenceforth, every day, and all day long, he waited at her grave,  for her.
  How many pictures of new journeys over pleasant country, of  resting-places under the free broad sky, of rambles in the fields and  woods, and paths not often trodden--how many tones of that one  well-remembered voice, how many glimpses of the form, the fluttering  dress, the hair that waved so gaily in the wind--how many visions of  what had been, and what he hoped was yet to be--rose up before him, in  the old, dull, silent church!  He never told them what he thought, or  where he went.
  He would sit with them at night, pondering with a  secret satisfaction, they could see, upon the flight that he and she  would take before night came again; and still they would hear him  whisper in his prayers, 'Lord!  Let her come to-morrow!'    The last time was on a genial day in spring.
  He did not return at the  usual hour, and they went to seek him.
  He was lying dead upon the  stone.
    They laid him by the side of her whom he had loved so well; and, in the  church where they had often prayed, and mused, and lingered hand in  hand, the child and the old man slept together.
              The magic reel, which, rolling on before, has led the chronicler thus  far, now slackens in its pace, and stops.
  It lies before the goal; the  pursuit is at an end.
    It remains but to dismiss the leaders of the little crowd who have  borne us company upon the road, and so to close the journey.
    Foremost among them, smooth Sampson Brass and Sally, arm in arm, claim  our polite attention.
    Mr Sampson, then, being detained, as already has been shown, by the  justice upon whom he called, and being so strongly pressed to protract  his stay that he could by no means refuse, remained under his  protection for a considerable time, during which the great attention of  his entertainer kept him so extremely close, that he was quite lost to  society, and never even went abroad for exercise saving into a small  paved yard.
  So well, indeed, was his modest and retiring temper  understood by those with whom he had to deal, and so jealous were they  of his absence, that they required a kind of friendly bond to be  entered into by two substantial housekeepers, in the sum of fifteen  hundred pounds a-piece, before they would suffer him to quit their  hospitable roof--doubting, it appeared, that he would return, if once  let loose, on any other terms.
  Mr Brass, struck with the humour of  this jest, and carrying out its spirit to the utmost, sought from his  wide connection a pair of friends whose joint possessions fell some  halfpence short of fifteen pence, and proffered them as bail--for that  was the merry word agreed upon both sides.
  These gentlemen being  rejected after twenty-four hours' pleasantry, Mr Brass consented to  remain, and did remain, until a club of choice spirits called a Grand  jury (who were in the joke) summoned him to a trial before twelve other  wags for perjury and fraud, who in their turn found him guilty with a  most facetious joy,--nay, the very populace entered into the whim, and  when Mr Brass was moving in a hackney-coach towards the building where  these wags assembled, saluted him with rotten eggs and carcases of  kittens, and feigned to wish to tear him into shreds, which greatly  increased the comicality of the thing, and made him relish it the more,  no doubt.
    To work this sportive vein still further, Mr Brass, by his counsel,  moved in arrest of judgment that he had been led to criminate himself,  by assurances of safety and promises of pardon, and claimed the  leniency which the law extends to such confiding natures as are thus  deluded.
  After solemn argument, this point (with others of a technical  nature, whose humorous extravagance it would be difficult to  exaggerate) was referred to the judges for their decision, Sampson  being meantime removed to his former quarters.
  Finally, some of the  points were given in Sampson's favour, and some against him; and the  upshot was, that, instead of being desired to travel for a time in  foreign parts, he was permitted to grace the mother country under  certain insignificant restrictions.
    These were, that he should, for a term of years, reside in a spacious  mansion where several other gentlemen were lodged and boarded at the  public charge, who went clad in a sober uniform of grey turned up with  yellow, had their hair cut extremely short, and chiefly lived on gruel  and light soup.
  It was also required of him that he should partake of  their exercise of constantly ascending an endless flight of stairs;  and, lest his legs, unused to such exertion, should be weakened by it,  that he should wear upon one ankle an amulet or charm of iron.
  These  conditions being arranged, he was removed one evening to his new abode,  and enjoyed, in common with nine other gentlemen, and two ladies, the  privilege of being taken to his place of retirement in one of Royalty's  own carriages.
    Over and above these trifling penalties, his name was erased and  blotted out from the roll of attorneys; which erasure has been always  held in these latter times to be a great degradation and reproach, and  to imply the commission of some amazing villany--as indeed it would  seem to be the case, when so many worthless names remain among its  better records, unmolested.
    Of Sally Brass, conflicting rumours went abroad.
  Some said with  confidence that she had gone down to the docks in male attire, and had  become a female sailor; others darkly whispered that she had enlisted  as a private in the second regiment of Foot Guards, and had been seen  in uniform, and on duty, to wit, leaning on her musket and looking out  of a sentry-box in St James's Park, one evening.
  There were many such  whispers as these in circulation; but the truth appears to be that,  after the lapse of some five years (during which there is no direct  evidence of her having been seen at all), two wretched people were more  than once observed to crawl at dusk from the inmost recesses of St  Giles's, and to take their way along the streets, with shuffling steps  and cowering shivering forms, looking into the roads and kennels as  they went in search of refuse food or disregarded offal.
  These forms  were never beheld but in those nights of cold and gloom, when the  terrible spectres, who lie at all other times in the obscene  hiding-places of London, in archways, dark vaults and cellars, venture  to creep into the streets; the embodied spirits of Disease, and Vice,  and Famine.
  It was whispered by those who should have known, that  these were Sampson and his sister Sally; and to this day, it is said,  they sometimes pass, on bad nights, in the same loathsome guise, close  at the elbow of the shrinking passenger.
    The body of Quilp being found--though not until some days had  elapsed--an inquest was held on it near the spot where it had been  washed ashore.
  The general supposition was that he had committed  suicide, and, this appearing to be favoured by all the circumstances of  his death, the verdict was to that effect.
  He was left to be buried  with a stake through his heart in the centre of four lonely roads.
    It was rumoured afterwards that this horrible and barbarous ceremony  had been dispensed with, and that the remains had been secretly given  up to Tom Scott.
  But even here, opinion was divided; for some said Tom  dug them up at midnight, and carried them to a place indicated to him  by the widow.
  It is probable that both these stories may have had  their origin in the simple fact of Tom's shedding tears upon the  inquest--which he certainly did, extraordinary as it may appear.
  He  manifested, besides, a strong desire to assault the jury; and being  restrained and conducted out of court, darkened its only window by  standing on his head upon the sill, until he was dexterously tilted  upon his feet again by a cautious beadle.
    Being cast upon the world by his master's death, he determined to go  through it upon his head and hands, and accordingly began to tumble for  his bread.
  Finding, however, his English birth an insurmountable  obstacle to his advancement in this pursuit (notwithstanding that his  art was in high repute and favour), he assumed the name of an Italian  image lad, with whom he had become acquainted; and afterwards tumbled  with extraordinary success, and to overflowing audiences.
    Little Mrs Quilp never quite forgave herself the one deceit that lay so  heavy on her conscience, and never spoke or thought of it but with  bitter tears.
 Her husband had no relations, and she was rich.
  He had  made no will, or she would probably have been poor.
  Having married the  first time at her mother's instigation, she consulted in her second  choice nobody but herself.
  It fell upon a smart young fellow enough;  and as he made it a preliminary condition that Mrs Jiniwin should be  thenceforth an out-pensioner, they lived together after marriage with no  more than the average amount of quarrelling, and led a merry life upon  the dead dwarf's money.
    Mr and Mrs Garland, and Mr Abel, went out as usual (except that there  was a change in their household, as will be seen presently), and in due  time the latter went into partnership with his friend the notary, on  which occasion there was a dinner, and a ball, and great extent of  dissipation.
  Unto this ball there happened to be invited the most  bashful young lady that was ever seen, with whom Mr Abel happened to  fall in love.
  HOW it happened, or how they found it out, or which of  them first communicated the discovery to the other, nobody knows.
  But  certain it is that in course of time they were married; and equally  certain it is that they were the happiest of the happy; and no less  certain it is that they deserved to be so.
  And it is pleasant to write  down that they reared a family; because any propagation of goodness and  benevolence is no small addition to the aristocracy of nature, and no  small subject of rejoicing for mankind at large.
    The pony preserved his character for independence and principle down to  the last moment of his life; which was an unusually long one, and  caused him to be looked upon, indeed, as the very Old Parr of ponies.
  He often went to and fro with the little phaeton between Mr Garland's  and his son's, and, as the old people and the young were frequently  together, had a stable of his own at the new establishment, into which  he would walk of himself with surprising dignity.
  He condescended to  play with the children, as they grew old enough to cultivate his  friendship, and would run up and down the little paddock with them like  a dog; but though he relaxed so far, and allowed them such small  freedoms as caresses, or even to look at his shoes or hang on by his  tail, he never permitted any one among them to mount his back or drive  him; thus showing that even their familiarity must have its limits, and  that there were points between them far too serious for trifling.
    He was not unsusceptible of warm attachments in his later life, for  when the good bachelor came to live with Mr Garland upon the  clergyman's decease, he conceived a great friendship for him, and  amiably submitted to be driven by his hands without the least  resistance.
  He did no work for two or three years before he died, but  lived in clover; and his last act (like a choleric old gentleman) was  to kick his doctor.
    Mr Swiveller, recovering very slowly from his illness, and entering  into the receipt of his annuity, bought for the Marchioness a handsome  stock of clothes, and put her to school forthwith, in redemption of the  vow he had made upon his fevered bed.
  After casting about for some  time for a name which should be worthy of her, he decided in favour of  Sophronia Sphynx, as being euphonious and genteel, and furthermore  indicative of mystery.
  Under this title the Marchioness repaired, in  tears, to the school of his selection, from which, as she soon  distanced all competitors, she was removed before the lapse of many  quarters to one of a higher grade.
  It is but bare justice to Mr  Swiveller to say, that, although the expenses of her education kept him  in straitened circumstances for half a dozen years, he never slackened  in his zeal, and always held himself sufficiently repaid by the  accounts he heard (with great gravity) of her advancement, on his  monthly visits to the governess, who looked upon him as a literary  gentleman of eccentric habits, and of a most prodigious talent in  quotation.
    In a word, Mr Swiveller kept the Marchioness at this establishment  until she was, at a moderate guess, full nineteen years of age--  good-looking, clever, and good-humoured; when he began to consider  seriously what was to be done next.
  On one of his periodical visits,  while he was revolving this question in his mind, the Marchioness came  down to him, alone, looking more smiling and more fresh than ever.
  Then, it occurred to him, but not for the first time, that if she would  marry him, how comfortable they might be!  So Richard asked her;  whatever she said, it wasn't No; and they were married in good earnest  that day week.
  Which gave Mr Swiveller frequent occasion to remark at  divers subsequent periods that there had been a young lady saving up  for him after all.
    A little cottage at Hampstead being to let, which had in its garden a  smoking-box, the envy of the civilised world, they agreed to become its  tenants, and, when the honey-moon was over, entered upon its  occupation.
  To this retreat Mr Chuckster repaired regularly every  Sunday to spend the day--usually beginning with breakfast--and here he  was the great purveyor of general news and fashionable intelligence.
  For some years he continued a deadly foe to Kit, protesting that he had  a better opinion of him when he was supposed to have stolen the  five-pound note, than when he was shown to be perfectly free of the  crime; inasmuch as his guilt would have had in it something daring and  bold, whereas his innocence was but another proof of a sneaking and  crafty disposition.
  By slow degrees, however, he was reconciled to him  in the end; and even went so far as to honour him with his patronage,  as one who had in some measure reformed, and was therefore to be  forgiven.
  But he never forgot or pardoned that circumstance of the  shilling; holding that if he had come back to get another he would have  done well enough, but that his returning to work out the former gift  was a stain upon his moral character which no penitence or contrition  could ever wash away.
    Mr Swiveller, having always been in some measure of a philosophic and  reflective turn, grew immensely contemplative, at times, in the  smoking-box, and was accustomed at such periods to debate in his own  mind the mysterious question of Sophronia's parentage.
  Sophronia  herself supposed she was an orphan; but Mr Swiveller, putting various  slight circumstances together, often thought Miss Brass must know  better than that; and, having heard from his wife of her strange  interview with Quilp, entertained sundry misgivings whether that  person, in his lifetime, might not also have been able to solve the  riddle, had he chosen.
  These speculations, however, gave him no  uneasiness; for Sophronia was ever a most cheerful, affectionate, and  provident wife to him; and Dick (excepting for an occasional outbreak  with Mr Chuckster, which she had the good sense rather to encourage  than oppose) was to her an attached and domesticated husband.
  And they  played many hundred thousand games of cribbage together.
  And let it be  added, to Dick's honour, that, though we have called her Sophronia, he  called her the Marchioness from first to last; and that upon every  anniversary of the day on which he found her in his sick room, Mr  Chuckster came to dinner, and there was great glorification.
    The gamblers, Isaac List and Jowl, with their trusty confederate Mr  James Groves of unimpeachable memory, pursued their course with varying  success, until the failure of a spirited enterprise in the way of their  profession, dispersed them in various directions, and caused their  career to receive a sudden check from the long and strong arm of the  law.
  This defeat had its origin in the untoward detection of a new  associate--young Frederick Trent--who thus became the unconscious  instrument of their punishment and his own.
    For the young man himself, he rioted abroad for a brief term, living by  his wits--which means by the abuse of every faculty that worthily  employed raises man above the beasts, and so degraded, sinks him far  below them.
  It was not long before his body was recognised by a  stranger, who chanced to visit that hospital in Paris where the drowned  are laid out to be owned; despite the bruises and disfigurements which  were said to have been occasioned by some previous scuffle.
  But the  stranger kept his own counsel until he returned home, and it was never  claimed or cared for.
    The younger brother, or the single gentleman, for that designation is  more familiar, would have drawn the poor schoolmaster from his lone  retreat, and made him his companion and friend.
  But the humble village  teacher was timid of venturing into the noisy world, and had become  fond of his dwelling in the old churchyard.
  Calmly happy in his  school, and in the spot, and in the attachment of Her little mourner,  he pursued his quiet course in peace; and was, through the righteous  gratitude of his friend--let this brief mention suffice for that--a  POOR school-master no more.
    That friend--single gentleman, or younger brother, which you will--had  at his heart a heavy sorrow; but it bred in him no misanthropy or  monastic gloom.
  He went forth into the world, a lover of his kind.
  For a long, long time, it was his chief delight to travel in the steps  of the old man and the child (so far as he could trace them from her  last narrative), to halt where they had halted, sympathise where they  had suffered, and rejoice where they had been made glad.
  Those who had  been kind to them, did not escape his search.
  The sisters at the  school--they who were her friends, because themselves so  friendless--Mrs Jarley of the wax-work, Codlin, Short--he found them  all; and trust me, the man who fed the furnace fire was not forgotten.
    Kit's story having got abroad, raised him up a host of friends, and  many offers of provision for his future life.
  He had no idea at first  of ever quitting Mr Garland's service; but, after serious remonstrance  and advice from that gentleman, began to contemplate the possibility of  such a change being brought about in time.
  A good post was procured  for him, with a rapidity which took away his breath, by some of the  gentlemen who had believed him guilty of the offence laid to his  charge, and who had acted upon that belief.
  Through the same kind  agency, his mother was secured from want, and made quite happy.
  Thus,  as Kit often said, his great misfortune turned out to be the source of  all his subsequent prosperity.
    Did Kit live a single man all his days, or did he marry?  Of course he  married, and who should be his wife but Barbara?  And the best of it  was, he married so soon that little Jacob was an uncle, before the  calves of his legs, already mentioned in this history, had ever been  encased in broadcloth pantaloons,--though that was not quite the best  either, for of necessity the baby was an uncle too.
  The delight of  Kit's mother and of Barbara's mother upon the great occasion is past  all telling; finding they agreed so well on that, and on all other  subjects, they took up their abode together, and were a most harmonious  pair of friends from that time forth.
  And hadn't Astley's cause to  bless itself for their all going together once a quarter--to the  pit--and didn't Kit's mother always say, when they painted the outside,  that Kit's last treat had helped to that, and wonder what the manager  would feel if he but knew it as they passed his house!    When Kit had children six and seven years old, there was a Barbara  among them, and a pretty Barbara she was.
  Nor was there wanting an  exact facsimile and copy of little Jacob, as he appeared in those  remote times when they taught him what oysters meant.
  Of course there  was an Abel, own godson to the Mr Garland of that name; and there was a  Dick, whom Mr Swiveller did especially favour.
  The little group would  often gather round him of a night and beg him to tell again that story  of good Miss Nell who died.
  This, Kit would do; and when they cried to  hear it, wishing it longer too, he would teach them how she had gone to  Heaven, as all good people did; and how, if they were good, like her,  they might hope to be there too, one day, and to see and know her as he  had done when he was quite a boy.
  Then, he would relate to them how  needy he used to be, and how she had taught him what he was otherwise  too poor to learn, and how the old man had been used to say 'she always  laughs at Kit;' at which they would brush away their tears, and laugh  themselves to think that she had done so, and be again quite merry.
    He sometimes took them to the street where she had lived; but new  improvements had altered it so much, it was not like the same.
  The old  house had been long ago pulled down, and a fine broad road was in its  place.
  At first he would draw with his stick a square upon the ground  to show them where it used to stand.
  But he soon became uncertain of  the spot, and could only say it was thereabouts, he thought, and these  alterations were confusing.
    Such are the changes which a few years bring about, and so do things  pass away, like a tale that is told!              .

                    RAFFLES    FURTHER ADVENTURES OF THE AMATEUR CRACKSMAN      BY    E.
 W.
 HORNUNG        CONTENTS        NO SINECURE    A JUBILEE PRESENT    THE FATE OF FAUSTINA    THE LAST LAUGH    TO CATCH A THIEF    AN OLD FLAME    THE WRONG HOUSE    THE KNEES OF THE GODS          RAFFLES        NO SINECURE      I    I am still uncertain which surprised me more, the telegram calling my  attention to the advertisement, or the advertisement itself.
  The  telegram is before me as I write.
  It would appear to have been handed  in at Vere Street at eight o'clock in the morning of May 11, 1897, and  received before half-past at Holloway B.
O.
  And in that drab region it  duly found me, unwashen but at work before the day grew hot and my  attic insupportable.
    "See Mr. Maturin's advertisement Daily Mail might suit you earnestly  beg try will speak if necessary ---- ----"    I transcribe the thing as I see it before me, all in one breath that  took away mine; but I leave out the  initials at the end, which  completed the surprise.
  They stood very obviously for the knighted  specialist whose consulting-room is within a cab-whistle of Vere  Street, and who once called me kinsman for his sins.
  More recently he  had called me other names.
  I was a disgrace, qualified by an adjective  which seemed to me another.
 I had made my bed, and I could go and lie  and die in it.
  If I ever again had the insolence to show my nose in  that house,  I should go out quicker than I came in.
  All this, and  more, my least distant relative could tell a poor devil to his face;  could ring for his man, and give him his brutal instructions on the  spot; and then relent to the tune of this telegram!  I have no phrase  for my amazement.
  I literally could not believe my eyes.
  Yet their  evidence was more and more conclusive: a very epistle could not have  been more characteristic of its sender.
 Meanly  elliptical, ludicrously  precise, saving half-pence at the expense of sense, yet paying like a  man for  "Mr." Maturin, that was my distinguished relative from his  bald patch to his corns.
  Nor was all  the rest unlike him, upon second  thoughts.
 He  had a reputation for charity; he was going to live  up to  it after all.
  Either that, or it was the sudden impulse of which the  most calculating are capable at times; the morning papers with the  early cup of tea, this advertisement seen by chance, and the rest upon  the spur of a guilty conscience.
    Well, I must see it for myself, and the sooner the better, though work  pressed.
  I was writing a series of articles upon prison life, and had  my nib into the whole System; a literary and philanthropical daily was  parading my "charges," the graver ones with the more gusto; and the  terms, if unhandsome for creative work, were temporary wealth to me.
  It so happened that my first check  had just arrived by the eight  o'clock post; and my position should be appreciated when I say that I  had to cash it to obtain a Daily Mail.
    Of the advertisement itself, what is to be said?  It should speak for  itself if I could find it, but I cannot, and only remember that it was  a "male  nurse and constant attendant" that was "wanted  for an elderly  gentleman in feeble health.
"  A  male nurse!  An absurd tag was  appended, offering "liberal salary to University or public-school man";  and of a sudden I saw that I should get this thing if I applied for it.
  What other "University or public-school man" would dream of  doing so?  Was any other in such straits as I?  And then my relenting relative; he  not only promised to speak for me, but was the very man to do so.
  Could any recommendation compete with his in the matter of a male  nurse?  And need the duties of such be necessarily loathsome and  repellent?  Certainly the surroundings would be better than those of my  common lodging-house and own particular garret; and the food; and every  other condition of life that I could think of on my way back to that  unsavory asylum.
  So I dived into a pawnbroker's shop, where I was a  stranger only upon my present errand, and within the hour was  airing a  decent if antiquated suit, but little corrupted by the pawnbroker's  moth, and a new straw hat, on the top of a tram.
    The address given in the advertisement was that of a flat at Earl's  Court, which cost me a cross-country journey, finishing with the  District Railway and a seven minutes' walk.
  It was now past mid-day,  and the tarry wood-pavement was good to smell as I strode up the Earl's  Court Road.
  It was great to walk the civilized world again.
  Here were  men with coats on their backs, and ladies in gloves.
  My only fear was  lest I might run up against one or other whom I had known of old.
  But  it was my lucky day.
  I felt it in my bones.
  I was going to get this  berth; and sometimes I should be able to smell the wood-pavement on the  old boy's errands; perhaps he would insist on skimming over it in his  bath-chair, with me behind.
    I felt quite nervous when I reached the flats.
  They were a small pile  in a side street, and I pitied the doctor whose plate I saw upon the  palings before the ground-floor windows; he must be in a  very small  way, I thought.
  I rather pitied myself as well.
 I had indulged in  visions of better flats than these.
  There were no balconies.
  The  porter was out of livery.
  There was no lift, and my invalid on the  third floor!  I trudged up, wishing I  had never lived in Mount Street,  and brushed against a dejected individual coming down.
  A  full-blooded  young fellow in a frock-coat flung the right door open at my summons.
    "Does Mr. Maturin live here?" I inquired.
    "That's right," said the full-blooded young man, grinning all over a  convivial countenance.
    "I--I've come about his advertisement in the Daily Mail.
"    "You're the thirty-ninth," cried the blood; "that was the thirty-eighth  you met upon the stairs,  and the day's still young.
  Excuse my staring  at you.
  Yes, you pass your prelim.
, and can come inside; you're one of  the few.
  We had most just after breakfast, but now the porter's  heading off the worst cases, and that last chap was the first for  twenty minutes.
 Come in here.
"    And I was ushered into an empty room with a good bay-window, which  enabled my full-blooded friend to inspect me yet more critically in a  good light; this he did without the least false delicacy;  then his  questions began.
    "'Varsity man?"    "No.
"    "Public school?"    "Yes.
"    "Which one?"    I told him, and he sighed relief.
    "At last!  You're the very first I've not had to argue with as to what  is and what is not a public school.
  Expelled?"    "No," I said, after a moment's hesitation; "no, I was not expelled.
  And I hope you won't expel me if I ask a question in my turn?"    "Certainly not.
"    "Are you Mr. Maturin's son?"    "No, my name's Theobald.
  You may have seen it down below.
"    "The doctor?" I said.
    "His doctor," said Theobald, with a satisfied  eye.
  "Mr. Maturin's  doctor.
  He is having a  male nurse and attendant by my advice, and he  wants a gentleman if he can get one.
  I rather think he'll see you,  though he's only seen two or three all day.
 There are certain questions  which  he prefers to ask himself, and it's no good going over the same  ground twice.
  So perhaps I had better tell him about you before we get  any further.
"    And he withdrew to a room still nearer the entrance, as I could hear,  for it was a very small flat indeed.
  But now two doors were shut  between us, and I had to rest content with murmurs through the wall  until the doctor returned to summon me.
    "I have persuaded my patient to see you," he whispered, "but I confess  I am not sanguine of the result.
  He is very difficult to please.
  You  must prepare yourself for a querulous invalid, and for no sinecure if  you get the billet.
"    "May I ask what's the matter with him?"    "By all means--when you've got the billet.
"    Dr.
 Theobald then led the way, his professional dignity so thoroughly  intact that I could not but smile as I followed his swinging coat-tails  to the sick-room.
  I carried no smile across the  threshold of a  darkened chamber which reeked of drugs and twinkled with medicine  bottles, and in the middle of which a gaunt figure lay abed in the  half-light.
    "Take him to the window, take him to the window," a thin voice snapped,  "and let's have a look  at him.
  Open the blind a bit.
 Not as much as  that, damn you, not as much as that!"    The doctor took the oath as though it had been a fee.
  I no longer  pitied him.
  It was now very clear to me that he had one patient who  was a little practice in himself.
  I determined there and then that he  should prove a little profession to me, if  we could but keep him alive  between us.
  Mr. Maturin, however, had the whitest face that I have  ever seen, and his teeth gleamed out through the dusk as though the  withered lips no longer met about them; nor did they except in speech;  and anything ghastlier than the perpetual grin of his repose I defy you  to imagine.
  It was with this grin that he lay regarding me while the  doctor held the blind.
    "So you think you could look after me, do you?"    "I'm certain I could, sir.
"    "Single-handed, mind!  I don't keep another soul.
  You would have to  cook your own grub and my slops.
  Do you think you could do all that?"    "Yes, sir, I think so.
"    "Why do you?  Have you any experience of the kind?"    "No, sir, none.
"    "Then why do you pretend you have?"    "I only meant that I would do my best.
"    "Only meant, only meant!  Have you done your best at everything else,  then?"    I hung my head.
  This was a facer.
  And there was something in my  invalid which thrust the unspoken lie down my throat.
    "No, sir, I have not," I told him plainly.
    "He, he, he!" the old wretch tittered; "and you do well to own it; you  do well, sir, very well indeed.
  If you hadn't owned up, out you would  have gone, out neck-and-crop!  You've saved your bacon.
  You may do  more.
  So you are a public-school boy, and a very good school yours is,  but you weren't at either University.
 Is that correct?"    "Absolutely.
"    "What did you do when you left school?"    "I came in for money.
"    "And then?"    "I spent my money.
"    "And since then?"    I stood like a mule.
    "And since then, I say!"    "A relative of mine will tell you if you ask him.
  He is an eminent  man, and he has promised to  speak for me.
  I would rather say no more  myself.
"    "But you shall, sir, but you shall!  Do you suppose that I suppose a  public-school boy would apply for a berth like this if something or  other hadn't happened?  What I want is a gentleman of sorts, and I  don't much care what sort; but you've got to tell me what did happen,  if you don't tell anybody else.
  Dr.
 Theobald, sir, you can go to the  devil if you won't take a hint.
 This man  may do or he may not.
  You  have no more to say to it till I send him down to tell you one thing or  the other.
  Clear out, sir, clear out; and if you think you've anything  to complain of, you stick it down in the bill!"    In the mild excitement of our interview the thin voice had gathered  strength, and the last shrill insult was screamed after the devoted  medico, as he retired in such order that I felt certain he was going to  take this trying patient at his word.
 The  bedroom door closed, then  the outer one, and the doctor's heels went drumming down the common  stair.
  I was alone in the flat with this highly singular and rather  terrible old man.
    "And a damned good riddance!" croaked the invalid, raising himself on  one elbow without  delay.
  "I may not have much body left to boast  about, but at least I've got a lost old soul to call my own.
  That's  why I want a gentleman of sorts  about me.
 I've been too dependent on  that chap.
  He won't even let me smoke, and he's been in the flat all  day to see I didn't.
 You'll find the cigarettes behind the Madonna of  the Chair.
"    It was a steel engraving of the great Raffaelle, and the frame was  tilted from the wall; at a touch a packet of cigarettes tumbled down  from behind.
    "Thanks; and now a light.
"    I struck the match and held it, while the invalid inhaled with normal  lips; and suddenly I sighed.
  I was irresistibly reminded of my poor  dear old Raffles.
  A smoke-ring worthy of the great A.
 J.
 was floating  upward from the sick man's lips.
    "And now take one yourself.
  I have smoked more poisonous cigarettes.
  But even these are not Sullivans!"    I cannot repeat what I said.
  I have no idea what I did.
  I only  know--I only knew--that it was A.
 J.
 Raffles in the flesh!      II    "Yes, Bunny, it was the very devil of a swim;  but I defy you to sink  in the Mediterranean.
  That  sunset saved me.
  The sea was on fire.
  I  hardly  swam under water at all, but went all I knew for the sun  itself; when it set I must have been a mile away; until it did I was  the invisible man.
  I  figured on that, and only hope it wasn't set  down as a case of suicide.
  I shall get outed quite soon enough, Bunny,  but I'd rather be dropped by the hangman than throw my own wicket away.
"    "Oh, my dear old chap, to think of having you by the hand again! I feel  as though we were both aboard that German liner, and all that's  happened since a nightmare.
  I thought that time was  the last!"    "It looked rather like it, Bunny.
  It was taking all the risks, and  hitting at everything.
  But the game came off, and some day I'll tell  you how.
"    "Oh, I'm in no hurry to hear.
  It's enough for me to see you lying  there.
  I don't want to know how you came there, or why, though I fear  you must be pretty bad.
  I must have a good look at you before I let  you speak another word!"    I raised one of the blinds, I sat upon the bed, and I had that look.
  It left me all unable to conjecture his true state of health, but quite  certain  in my own mind that my dear Raffles was not and never would be  the man that he had been.
  He had aged twenty years; he looked fifty at  the very least.
  His hair was white; there was no trick  about that;  and his face was another white.
  The lines about the corners of the  eyes and mouth were both many and deep.
  On the other hand, the eyes  themselves were alight and alert as ever; they were still keen and gray  and gleaming, like finely tempered steel.
  Even the mouth, with a  cigarette to close it, was the mouth of Raffles and no other:  strong  and unscrupulous as the man himself.
  It was only the physical strength  which appeared to  have departed; but that was quite sufficient to make  my heart bleed for the dear rascal who had cost me every tie I valued  but the tie between us two.
    "Think I look much older?" he asked at length.
    "A bit," I admitted.
  "But it is chiefly your hair.
"    "Whereby hangs a tale for when we've talked ourselves out, though I  have often thought it was that long swim that started it.
  Still, the  Island of Elba is a rummy show, I can assure you.
  And  Naples is a  rummier!"    "You went there after all?"    "Rather!  It's the European paradise for such as our noble selves.
  But  there's no place that's a patch on little London as a non-conductor of  heat;  it never need get too hot for a fellow here;  if it does it's  his own fault.
  It's the kind of wicket you don't get out on, unless  you get yourself out.
  So here I am again, and have been for the last  six weeks.
  And I mean to have another knock.
"    "But surely, old fellow, you're not awfully fit, are you?"    "Fit?  My dear Bunny, I'm dead--I'm at the bottom of the sea--and don't  you forget it for a  minute.
"    "But are you all right, or are you not?"    "No, I'm half-poisoned by Theobald's prescriptions and putrid  cigarettes, and as weak as a cat from lying in bed.
"    "Then why on earth lie in bed, Raffles?"    "Because it's better than lying in gaol, as I am afraid YOU know, my  poor dear fellow.
  I tell you I am dead; and my one terror is of coming  to life again by accident.
  Can't you see? I simply dare not show my  nose out of doors--by day.
  You  have no idea of the number of  perfectly innocent things a dead man daren't do.
  I can't even smoke  Sullivans, because no one man was ever so partial to them as I was in  my lifetime, and you never know when you may start a clew.
"    "What brought you to these mansions?"    "I fancied a flat, and a man recommended these on the boat; such a good  chap, Bunny; he was my reference when it came to signing the lease.
  You see I landed on a stretcher--most pathetic case--old Australian  without a friend in old country--ordered Engadine as last chance--no  go--not an earthly--sentimental wish to die in London--that's the  history of Mr. Maturin.
  If it doesn't  hit you hard, Bunny, you're the  first.
  But it hit friend Theobald hardest of all.
  I'm an income to  him.
  I believe he's going to marry on me.
"    "Does he guess there's nothing wrong?"    "Knows, bless you!  But he doesn't know I know he knows, and there  isn't a disease in the  dictionary that he hasn't treated me for since  he's had me in hand.
  To do him justice, I believe he thinks me a  hypochondriac of the first water; but that young man will go far if he  keeps on the wicket.
  He has spent half his nights up here, at guineas  apiece.
"    "Guineas must be plentiful, old chap!"    "They have been, Bunny.
  I can't say more.
  But I don't see why they  shouldn't be again.
"    I was not going to inquire where the guineas came from.
  As if I cared!  But I did ask old Raffles how in the world he had got upon my tracks;  and thereby drew the sort of smile with which old gentlemen rub their  hands, and old ladies nod their noses.
 Raffles merely produced a  perfect  oval of blue smoke before replying.
    "I was waiting for you to ask that, Bunny; it's a long time since I did  anything upon which I plume myself more.
  Of course, in the first  place, I spotted you at once by these prison articles; they were not  signed, but the fist was the fist of my sitting rabbit!"    "But who gave you my address?"    "I wheedled it out of your excellent editor; called on him at dead of  night, when I occasionally go afield like other ghosts, and wept it out  of him in five minutes.
  I was your only relative;  your name was not  your own name; if he insisted  I would give him mine.
  He didn't  insist, Bunny,  and I danced down his stairs with your address in my  pocket.
"    "Last night?"    "No, last week.
"    "And so the advertisement was yours, as well as the telegram!"    I had, of course, forgotten both in the high excitement of the hour, or  I should scarcely have announced my belated discovery with such an air.
  As it was I made Raffles look at me as I had known  him look before,  and the droop of his eyelids  began to sting.
    "Why all this subtlety?" I petulantly exclaimed.
  "Why couldn't you  come straight away to me in a cab?"    He did not inform me that I was hopeless as ever.
  He did not address  me as his good rabbit.
    He was silent for a time, and then spoke in a tone which made me  ashamed of mine.
    "You see, there are two or three of me now, Bunny: one's at the bottom  of the Mediterranean,  and one's an old Australian desirous of dying in  the old country, but in no immediate danger of  dying anywhere.
  The  old Australian doesn't know a soul in town; he's got to be consistent,  or he's done.
  This sitter Theobald is his only friend, and has seen  rather too much of him; ordinary dust won't do for his eyes.
  Begin to  see?  To pick you out of a crowd, that was the game; to let old  Theobald help to pick you, better still!  To start with, he was dead  against my having anybody at all; wanted me all to himself, naturally;  but anything rather than kill the goose!  So he is to have a fiver a  week while he keeps me alive, and he's going to be married next month.
  That's a pity in some ways, but a good thing in others; he will want  more money than he foresees, and he  may always be of use to us at a  pinch.
  Meanwhile he eats out of my hand.
"    I complimented Raffles on the mere composition of his telegram, with  half the characteristics  of my distinguished kinsman squeezed into a  dozen odd words; and let him know how the old ruffian had really  treated me.
  Raffles was not surprised; we had dined together at my  relative's in the old days, and filed for reference a professional  valuation of his household gods.
  I now learnt that the telegram had  been posted, with the hour marked for its despatch, at the pillar  nearest Vere Street, on the night before the advertisement was due to  appear in the Daily Mail.
  This also  had been carefully prearranged;  and Raffles's only fear had been lest it might be held over despite his  explicit instructions, and so drive me to the  doctor for an  explanation of his telegram.
  But the adverse chances had been weeded  out and  weeded out to the irreducible minimum of  risk.
    His greatest risk, according to Raffles, lay nearest home: bedridden  invalid that he was supposed to be, his nightly terror was of running  into Theobald's arms in the immediate neighborhood of the flat.
  But  Raffles had characteristic methods of minimizing even that danger, of  which something anon; meanwhile he recounted more than one of  his  nocturnal adventures, all, however, of a singularly innocent type; and  one thing I noticed while  he talked.
  His room was the first as you  entered  the flat.
  The long inner wall divided the room  not merely  from the passage but from the outer landing as well.
 Thus every step  upon the bare stone stairs could be heard by Raffles where he lay;  and  he would never speak while one was ascending, until it had passed his  door.
  The afternoon brought more than one applicant for the post which  it was my duty to tell them that I had already obtained.
  Between three  and four, however, Raffles, suddenly looking at his watch, packed me  off in a hurry to the other end of  London for my things.
    "I'm afraid you must be famishing, Bunny.
  It's a fact that I eat very  little, and that at odd hours, but I ought not to have forgotten you.
  Get yourself a snack outside, but not a square meal if you  can resist  one.
  We've got to celebrate this day this night!"    "To-night?" I cried.
    "To-night at eleven, and Kellner's the place.
  You may well open your  eyes, but we didn't go there much, if you remember, and the staff seems  changed.
  Anyway we'll risk it for once.
  I was in last night, talking  like a stage American, and supper's ordered for eleven sharp.
"    "You made as sure of me as all that!"    "There was no harm in ordering supper.
  We shall have it in a private  room, but you may as well dress if you've got the duds.
"    "They're at my only forgiving relative's.
"    "How much will get them out, and square you up, and bring you back bag  and baggage in good time?"    I had to calculate.
    "A tenner, easily.
"    "I had one ready for you.
  Here it is, and I wouldn't lose any time if  I were you.
  On the way you might look up Theobald, tell him you've got  it and how long you'll be gone, and that I can't be left alone all the  time.
  And, by Jove, yes!  You get me a stall for the Lyceum at the  nearest agent's; there are two or three in High Street; and say it was  given you when you come in.
 That young  man shall be out of the way  to-night.
"    I found our doctor in a minute consulting-room and his shirt-sleeves, a  tall tumbler at his elbow; at least I caught sight of the tumbler on  entering;  thereafter he stood in front of it, with a futility which  had my sympathy.
    "So you've got the billet," said Dr.
 Theobald.
  "Well, as I told you  before, and as you have since probably discovered for yourself, you  won't find it exactly a sinecure.
  My own part of the business is by no  means that; indeed, there are those who would throw up the case, after  the kind of treatment that you have seen for yourself.
  But  professional considerations are not the only ones, and one cannot make  too many allowances in such a case.
"    "But what is the case?" I asked him.
  "You said you would tell me if I  was successful.
"    Dr.
 Theobald's shrug was worthy of the profession he seemed destined to  adorn; it was not incompatible with any construction which one chose to  put upon it.
  Next moment he had stiffened.
 I suppose I still spoke  more or less like  a gentleman.
  Yet, after all, I was only the  male  nurse.
  He seemed to remember this suddenly, and he took occasion to  remind me of the fact.
    "Ah," said he, "that was before I knew you were altogether without  experience; and I must  say that I was surprised even at Mr. Maturin's  engaging you after that; but it will depend upon yourself how long I  allow him to persist in so curious an experiment.
  As for what is the  matter with him, my good fellow, it is no use my giving you an answer  which would be double Dutch to you; moreover, I have still to test your  discretionary powers.
  I may say, however, that that  poor gentleman  presents at once the most complex and most troublesome case, which is  responsibility enough without certain features which make it all but  insupportable.
  Beyond this I must refuse to discuss my patient for the  present; but I shall certainly go up if I can find time.
"    He went up within five minutes.
  I found him there on my return at  dusk.
  But he did not refuse my stall for the Lyceum, which Raffles  would not allow me to use myself, and presented to him off-hand without  my leave.
    "And don't you bother any more about me till to-morrow," snapped the  high thin voice as he was off.
  "I can send for you now when I want  you, and I'm hoping to have a decent night for once.
"      III    It was half-past ten when we left the flat, in an interval of silence  on the noisy stairs.
  The silence was unbroken by our wary feet.
  Yet  for me a surprise was in store upon the very landing.
  Instead of going  downstairs, Raffles led me up two flights, and so out upon a perfectly  flat roof.
    "There are two entrances to these mansions," he explained between stars  and chimney-stacks: "one to our staircase, and another round the  corner.
  But there's only one porter, and he lives on the  basement  underneath us, and affects the door nearest home.
  We miss him by using  the wrong stairs, and we run less risk of old Theobald.
  I got the tip  from the postmen, who come up one way and down the other.
  Now, follow  me, and look out!"    There was indeed some necessity for caution, for each half of the  building had its L-shaped well dropping sheer to the base, the parapets  so low that one might easily have tripped over them into  eternity.
  However, we were soon upon the second staircase, which opened on the  roof like the first.
  And twenty minutes of the next twenty-five we  spent in an admirable hansom, skimming east.
    "Not much change in the old hole, Bunny.
  More of these magic-lantern  advertisements .
.
.
 and absolutely the worst bit of taste in town,  though it's saying something, in that equestrian statue with the gilt  stirrups and fixings; why don't they black the buffer's boots and his  horse's hoofs while they are about it? .
.
.
  More bicyclists, of course.
  That was just beginning, if you remember.
  It might have been useful to  us.
.
.
.
 And there's the old club, getting put into a crate for the  Jubilee; by Jove, Bunny, we ought to be there.
  I wouldn't lean forward  in Piccadilly, old chap.
  If you're seen I'm thought of, and we shall  have to be jolly careful at Kellner's.
.
.
.
  Ah, there it is!  Did I tell  you I was a low-down stage Yankee at Kellner's?  You'd better be  another, while the waiter's in the room.
"    We had the little room upstairs; and on the very threshold I, even I,  who knew my Raffles of old, was taken horribly aback.
 The table was  laid for three.
  I called his attention to it in a whisper.
    "Why, yep!" came through his nose.
  "Say, boy, the lady, she's not  comin', but you leave that tackle where 'tis.
  If I'm liable to pay, I  guess I'll have all there is to it.
"    I have never been in America, and the American public is the last on  earth that I desire to insult;  but idiom and intonation alike would  have imposed upon my inexperience.
  I had to look at Raffles to make  sure that it was he who spoke, and I had my own reasons for looking  hard.
    "Who on earth was the lady?" I inquired aghast at the first opportunity.
    "She isn't on earth.
  They don't like wasting this room on two, that's  all.
  Bunny--my Bunny--here's to us both!"    And we clinked glasses swimming with the liquid gold of Steinberg,  1868; but of the rare delights of that supper I can scarcely trust  myself to write.
  It was no mere meal, it was no coarse orgy, but a  little feast for the fastidious gods, not unworthy of Lucullus at his  worst.
  And I who had bolted my skilly at Wormwood Scrubbs, and  tightened my  belt in a Holloway attic, it was I who sat down to this  ineffable repast!  Where the courses were few, but each a triumph of  its kind, it would be invidious to single out any one dish; but the  Jambon de Westphalie au Champagne tempts me sorely.
  And then the  champagne that we drank, not the quantity but the quality!  Well, it  was Pol Roger, '84, and  quite good enough for me; but even so it was  not  more dry, nor did it sparkle more, than the merry  rascal who had  dragged me thus far to the devil, but should lead me dancing the rest  of the way.
  I was beginning to tell him so.
  I had done my honest best  since my reappearance in the world;  but the world had done its worst  by me.
  A further antithesis and my final intention were both upon  my  tongue when the waiter with the Chateau Margaux cut me short; for he  was the bearer of more than that great wine; bringing also a card upon  a  silver tray.
    "Show him up," said Raffles, laconically.
    "And who is this?" I cried when the man was gone.
  Raffles reached  across the table and gripped  my arm in a vice.
  His eyes were steel  points fixed on mine.
    "Bunny, stand by me," said he in the old irresistible voice, a voice  both stern and winning.
  "Stand by me, Bunny--if there's a row!"    And there was time for nothing more, the door flying open, and a dapper  person entering with a bow; a frock-coat on his back, gold pince-nez on  his nose; a shiny hat in one hand, and a black bag in the other.
    "Good-evening, gentlemen," said he, at home and smiling.
    "Sit down," drawled Raffles in casual response.
  "Say, let me introduce  you to Mr. Ezra B.
 Martin, of Shicawgo.
  Mr. Martin is my future  brother-in-law.
  This is Mr. Robinson, Ezra, manager to Sparks &  Company, the cellerbrated joolers on Re-gent Street.
"    I pricked up my ears, but contented myself with a nod.
  I altogether  distrusted my ability to live up to my new name and address.
    "I figured on Miss Martin bein' right here, too," continued Raffles,  "but I regret to say she's  not feelin' so good.
  We light out for  Parrus on the 9 A.
 M.
 train to-morrer mornin', and she  guessed she'd  be too dead.
  Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Robinson; but you'll see I'm  advertisin' your wares.
"    Raffles held his right hand under the electric light, and a diamond  ring flashed upon his little finger.
  I could have sworn it was not  there five  minutes before.
    The tradesman had a disappointed face, but for a moment it brightened  as he expatiated on the value of that ring and on the price his people  had accepted for it.
  I was invited to guess the figure, but I shook a  discreet head.
  I have seldom been more taciturn in my life.
    "Forty-five pounds," cried the jeweller; "and it would be cheap at  fifty guineas.
"    "That's right," assented Raffles.
  "That'd be dead cheap, I allow.
  But  then, my boy, you gotten ready cash, and don't you forget it.
"    I do not dwell upon my own mystification in all this.
  I merely pause  to state that I was keenly enjoying that very element.
 Nothing could  have been more typical of Raffles and the past.
 It was only my own  attitude that was changed.
    It appeared that the mythical lady, my sister, had just become engaged  to Raffles, who seemed  all anxiety to pin her down with gifts of  price.
  I could not quite gather whose gift to whom was the diamond  ring; but it had evidently been paid for; and I voyaged to the moon,  wondering when and how.
  I was recalled to this planet by a deluge of  gems from the jeweller's bag.
  They lay alight in their cases like the  electric lamps above.
  We all three put our heads together over them,  myself  without the slightest clew as to what was coming, but not  unprepared for violent crime.
  One does not do eighteen months for  nothing.
    "Right away," Raffles was saying.
  "We'll choose for her, and you'll  change anything she don't like.
  Is that the idea?"    "That was my suggestion, sir.
"    "Then come on, Ezra.
  I guess you know Sadie's taste.
  You help me  choose.
"    And we chose--lord!  What did we not choose?  There was her ring, a  diamond half-hoop.
  It cost L95, and there was no attempt to get it for  L90.
  Then there was a diamond necklet--two  hundred guineas, but  pounds accepted.
  That was  to be the gift of the bridegroom.
  The  wedding  was evidently imminent.
  It behooved me to play a  brotherly  part.
  I therefore rose to the occasion; calculated she would like a  diamond star (L116), but reckoned it was more than I could afford; and  sustained a vicious kick under the table for either verb.
  I was afraid  to open my mouth on finally  obtaining the star for the round hundred.
  And then the fat fell in the fire; for pay we could not; though a  remittance (said Raffles) was "overdo from Noo York.
"    "But I don't know you, gentlemen," the jeweller exclaimed.
  "I haven't  even the name of your hotel!"    "I told you we was stoppin' with friends," said Raffles, who was not  angry, though thwarted and crushed.
  "But that's right, sir! Oh, that's  dead  right, and I'm the last man to ask you to take Quixotic risks.
  I'm tryin' to figure a way out.
  Yes, SIR, that's what I'm tryin' to  do.
"    "I wish you could, sir," the jeweller said, with feeling.
  "It isn't as  if we hadn't seen the color  of your money.
  But certain rules I'm  sworn to observe; it isn't as if I was in business for myself; and--you  say you start for Paris in the morning!"    "On the 9 A.
 M.
 train," mused Raffles; "and I've heard no-end yarns  about the joolers' stores in Parrus.
  But that ain't fair; don't you  take no notice o' that.
  I'm tryin' to figure a way out.
  Yes, SIR!"    He was smoking cigarettes out of a twenty-five box; the tradesman and I  had cigars.
  Raffles sat frowning with a pregnant eye, and it was only  too clear to me that his plans had miscarried.
  I could not help  thinking, however, that they deserved to do so, if he had counted upon  buying credit for all but L400 by a single payment of some ten per  cent.
  That again seemed unworthy of Raffles, and I, for my part, still  sat prepared to spring any moment at our visitor's throat.
    "We could mail you the money from Parrus,"  drawled Raffles at length.
  "But how should we know you'd hold up your end of the string, and mail  us the same articles we've selected to-night?"    The visitor stiffened in his chair.
  The name of his firm should be  sufficient guarantee for that.
    "I guess I'm no better acquainted with their name than they are with  mine," remarked Raffles, laughing.
  "See here, though!  I got a scheme.
  You pack 'em in this!"    He turned the cigarettes out of the tin box,  while the jeweller and I  joined wondering eyes.
    "Pack 'em in this," repeated Raffles, "the three things we want, and  never mind the boxes; you can pack 'em in cotton-wool.
  Then we'll ring  for string and sealing wax, seal up the lot right here,  and you can  take 'em away in your grip.
  Within three days we'll have our  remittance, and mail you the money, and you'll mail us this darned box  with my seal unbroken!  It's no use you lookin' so sick, Mr. Jooler;  you won't trust us any, and yet  we're goin' to trust you some.
  Ring  the bell, Ezra, and we'll see if they've gotten any sealing-wax and  string.
"    They had; and the thing was done.
  The tradesman did not like it; the  precaution was absolutely unnecessary; but since he was taking all his  goods away with him, the sold with the unsold, his sentimental  objections soon fell to the ground.
  He packed necklet, ring, and star,  with his own hands, in cotton-wool; and the cigarette-box held them so  easily that at the last moment, when the box was closed, and the string  ready, Raffles very nearly added a diamond bee-brooch at L51 10s.
  This  temptation, however, he ultimately overcame, to the other's chagrin.
  The cigarette-box was tied up, and the string sealed, oddly enough,  with the diamond of the ring that had been bought and paid for.
    "I'll chance you having another ring in the store the dead spit of  mine," laughed Raffles, as he relinquished the box, and it disappeared  into the tradesman's bag.
  "And now, Mr. Robinson, I hope you'll  appreciate my true hospitality in not offering you any thing to drink  while business was in progress.
  That's Chateau Margaux, sir, and I  should judge it's what you'd call an eighteen-carat article.
"    In the cab which we took to the vicinity of the flat, I was instantly  snubbed for asking questions which the driver might easily overhear,  and took the repulse just a little to heart.
  I could make  neither  head nor tail of Raffles's dealings with the man from Regent Street,  and was naturally inquisitive as to the meaning of it all.
  But I held  my tongue until we had regained the flat in the cautious manner of our  exit, and even there until Raffles rallied me with a hand on either  shoulder and an old smile upon his face.
    "You rabbit!" said he.
  "Why couldn't you wait till we got home?"    "Why couldn't you tell me what you were going to do?" I retorted as of  yore.
    "Because your dear old phiz is still worth its weight in innocence, and  because you never could act for nuts!  You looked as puzzled as the  other poor devil; but you wouldn't if you had known what my game really  was.
"    "And pray what was it?"    "That," said Raffles, and he smacked the cigarette-box down upon the  mantelpiece.
  It was not tied.
  It was not sealed.
  It flew open from  the force of the impact.
  And the diamond ring that cost L95, the  necklet for L200, and my flaming  star at another L100, all three lay  safe and snug in the jeweller's own cotton-wool!    "Duplicate boxes!" I cried.
    "Duplicate boxes, my brainy Bunny.
  One was already packed and  weighted, and in my pocket.
  I don't know whether you noticed me  weighing the three things together in my hand?  I know that neither of  you saw me change the boxes, for I did it when I was nearest buying the  bee-brooch at the end, and you were too puzzled, and the other  Johnny  too keen.
  It was the cheapest shot in the game; the dear ones were  sending old Theobald  to Southampton on a fool's errand yesterday  afternoon, and showing one's own nose down Regent Street in broad  daylight while he was gone;  but some things are worth paying for, and  certain  risks one must always take.
  Nice boxes, aren't  they?  I only  wished they contained a better cigarette; but a notorious brand was  essential; a box  of Sullivans would have brought me to life to-morrow.
"    "But they oughtn't to open it to-morrow.
"    "Nor will they, as a matter of fact.
  Meanwhile, Bunny, I may call upon  you to dispose of the boodle.
"    "I'm on for any mortal thing!"    My voice rang true, I swear, but it was the way  of Raffles to take the  evidence of as many senses  as possible.
  I felt the cold steel of his  eyes through  mine and through my brain.
  But what he saw seemed to  satisfy him no less than what he heard, for his hand found my hand, and  pressed it with a  fervor foreign to the man.
    "I know you are, and I knew you would be.
  Only remember, Bunny, it's  my turn next to pay the shot!"    You shall hear how he paid it when the time came.
        A JUBILEE PRESENT    The Room of Gold, in the British Museum, is probably well enough known  to the inquiring alien and the travelled American.
  A true Londoner,  however, I myself had never heard of it until Raffles casually proposed  a raid.
    "The older I grow, Bunny, the less I think of your so-called precious  stones.
  When did they ever bring in half their market value in L.
s.
d.
  There was the first little crib we ever cracked together--you with  your innocent eyes shut.
  A  thousand pounds that stuff was worth; but  how many hundreds did it actually fetch.
  The Ardagh emeralds weren't  much better; old Lady Melrose's necklace was far worse; but that little  lot the other night has about finished me.
  A cool hundred for goods  priced well over four; and L35 to come off for bait, since we only got  a tenner for the ring I bought and paid for like an ass.
  I'll be shot  if I  ever touch a diamond again!  Not if it was the  Koh-I-noor; those  few whacking stones are too well known, and to cut them up is to  decrease their value by arithmetical retrogression.
  Besides, that  brings you up against the Fence once more, and I'm done with the  beggars for good and all.
  You talk about your editors and publishers,  you literary swine.
  Barabbas was neither a robber nor a publisher, but  a six-barred, barbed-wired, spike-topped Fence.
  What we really want is  an Incorporated Society of Thieves, with some public-spirited old  forger to run it for us on business lines.
"    Raffles uttered these blasphemies under his breath, not, I am afraid,  out of any respect for my one redeeming profession, but because we were  taking a midnight airing on the roof, after a whole day of June in the  little flat below.
  The stars  shone overhead, the lights of London  underneath, and between the lips of Raffles a cigarette of the old and  only brand.
  I had sent in secret for a box of the best; the boon had  arrived that night; and the foregoing speech was the first result.
  I  could afford to ignore the insolent asides, however, where the apparent  contention was so manifestly unsound.
    "And how are you going to get rid of your gold?" said I, pertinently.
    "Nothing easier, my dear rabbit.
"    "Is your Room of Gold a roomful of sovereigns?"    Raffles laughed softly at my scorn.
    "No, Bunny, it's principally in the shape of archaic ornaments, whose  value, I admit, is largely  extrinsic.
  But gold is gold, from  Phoenicia to  Klondike, and if we cleared the room we should eventually  do very well.
"    "How?"    "I should melt it down into a nugget, and bring it home from the U.
S.
A.
  to-morrow.
"    "And then?"    "Make them pay up in hard cash across the counter of the Bank of  England.
  And you CAN make them.
"    That I knew, and so said nothing for a time, remaining a hostile though  a silent critic, while we paced the cool black leads with our bare  feet, softly as cats.
    "And how do you propose to get enough away," at length I asked, "to  make it worth while?"    "Ah, there you have it," said Raffles.
  "I only propose to reconnoitre  the ground, to see what we  can see.
  We might find some hiding-place  for a night; that, I am afraid, would be our only chance.
"    "Have you ever been there before?"    "Not since they got the one good, portable piece which I believe that  they exhibit now.
  It's a long time since I read of it--I can't  remember where--but I know they have got a gold cup of sorts worth  several thousands.
  A number of the immorally  rich clubbed together  and presented it to the nation; and two of the richly immoral intend to  snaffle it for themselves.
  At any rate we might go and have a look at  it, Bunny, don't you think?"    Think!  I seized his arm.
    "When?  When?  When?" I asked, like a quick-firing gun.
    "The sooner the better, while old Theobald's away on his honeymoon.
"    Our medico had married the week before, nor was any fellow-practitioner  taking his work--at least not that considerable branch of it which  consisted of Raffles--during his brief absence from  town.
  There were  reasons, delightfully obvious to us, why such a plan would have been  highly unwise in Dr.
 Theobald.
  I, however, was sending him daily  screeds, and both matutinal and nocturnal telegrams, the composition of  which afforded Raffles not a little enjoyment.
    "Well, then, when--when?" I began to repeat.
    "To-morrow, if you like.
"    "Only to look?"    The limitation was my one regret.
    "We must do so, Bunny, before we leap.
"    "Very well," I sighed.
  "But to-morrow it is!"    And the morrow it really was.
    I saw the porter that night, and, I still think, bought his absolute  allegiance for the second coin of the realm.
  My story, however,  invented by  Raffles, was sufficiently specious in itself.
  That sick  gentleman, Mr. Maturin (as I had to remember to call him), was really,  or apparently, sickening for fresh air.
  Dr.
 Theobald would allow him  none; he was pestering me for just one day in the country while the  glorious weather lasted.
 I was myself convinced that no possible harm  could come of the experiment.
  Would the porter help me in so innocent  and meritorious an intrigue?  The  man hesitated.
  I produced my  half-sovereign.
  The man was lost.
  And at half-past eight next  morning--before the heat of the day--Raffles and I drove to Kew Gardens  in a hired landau which was to call for us at mid-day and wait until we  came.
  The porter had assisted me to carry my invalid downstairs, in a  carrying-chair hired (like  the landau) from Harrod's Stores for the  occasion.
    It was little after nine when we crawled together into the gardens; by  half-past my invalid had had enough, and out he tottered on my arm; a  cab, a  message to our coachman, a timely train to Baker Street,  another cab, and we were at the British Museum--brisk pedestrians  now--not very many  minutes after the opening hour of 10 A.
M.
    It was one of those glowing days which will not be forgotten by many  who were in town at the  time.
  The Diamond Jubilee was upon us, and  Queen's weather had already set in.
  Raffles, indeed, declared it was  as hot as Italy and Australia  put together; and certainly the short  summer nights gave the channels of wood and asphalt and the continents  of brick and mortar but little time to cool.
  At the British Museum the  pigeons were crooning among the shadows of the grimy colonnade, and the  stalwart janitors looked less stalwart  than usual, as though their  medals were too heavy for them.
  I recognized some habitual Readers  going to their labor underneath the dome; of mere visitors we seemed  among the first.
    "That's the room," said Raffles, who had bought the two-penny guide, as  we studied it openly on the nearest bench; "number 43, upstairs and  sharp round to the right.
  Come on, Bunny!"    And he led the way in silence, but with a long methodical stride which  I could not understand until we came to the corridor leading to the  Room of Gold, when he turned to me for a moment.
    "A hundred and thirty-nine yards from this to  the open street," said  Raffles, "not counting the stairs.
  I suppose we COULD do it in twenty  seconds, but if we did we should have to jump the gates.
  No, you must  remember to loaf out at slow march, Bunny, whether you like it or not.
"    "But you talked about a hiding-place for a night?"    "Quite so--for all night.
  We should have to get back, go on lying low,  and saunter out with the crowd next day--after doing the whole show  thoroughly.
"    "What!  With gold in our pockets--"    "And gold in our boots, and gold up the sleeves and legs of our suits!  You leave that to me, Bunny, and wait till you've tried two pairs of  trousers sewn together at the foot!  This is only a preliminary  reconnoitre.
  And here we are.
"    It is none of my business to describe the so-called Room of Gold, with  which I, for one, was not a little disappointed.
  The glass cases,  which both fill and line it, may contain unique examples of the  goldsmith's art in times and places of which one heard quite enough in  the course of one's classical education; but, from a professional point  of view, I would as lief have the ransacking of a single window in the  West End as the pick of all those spoils of Etruria and of ancient  Greece.
 The  gold may not be so soft as it appears, but it certainly  looks as though you could bite off the business ends of the spoons, and  stop your own teeth in doing so.
  Nor should I care to be seen wearing  one of the rings; but the greatest fraud of all  (from the aforesaid  standpoint) is assuredly that very cup of which Raffles had spoken.
  Moreover, he felt this himself.
    "Why, it's as thin as paper," said he, "and enamelled like a  middle-aged lady of quality!  But, by Jove, it's one of the most  beautiful things I ever saw in my life, Bunny.
  I should like to have  it for its own sake, by all my gods!"    The thing had a little square case of plate-glass all to itself at one  end of the room.
  It may have been the thing of beauty that Raffles  affected to consider it, but I for my part was in no mood to look at it  in that light.
  Underneath were the names of the plutocrats who had  subscribed for this national gewgaw, and I fell to wondering where  their L8,000 came in, while Raffles devoured his  two-penny guide-book  as greedily as a school-girl with a zeal for culture.
    "Those are scenes from the martyrdom of St.
 Agnes," said he .
.
.
  "'translucent on relief .
.
.
 one of the finest specimens of its  kind.
'  I should think it was!  Bunny, you Philistine, why can't you admire the  thing for its own  sake?  It would be worth having only to live up to!  There never was such rich enamelling on such thin gold; and what a good  scheme to hang the lid up over it, so that you can see how thin it is.
  I wonder if we could lift it, Bunny, by hook or crook?"    "You'd better try, sir," said a dry voice at his elbow.
    The madman seemed to think we had the room to ourselves.
  I knew  better, but, like another madman, had let him ramble on unchecked.
  And  here  was a stolid constable confronting us, in the short tunic that  they wear in summer, his whistle on its chain, but no truncheon at his  side.
  Heavens!  how I see him now: a man of medium size, with a  broad, good-humored, perspiring face, and a limp moustache.
  He looked  sternly at Raffles, and Raffles looked merrily at him.
    "Going to run me in, officer?" said he.
  "That WOULD be a joke--my hat!"    "I didn't say as I was, sir," replied the policeman.
  "But that's queer  talk for a gentleman like you, sir, in the British Museum!"  And he  wagged  his helmet at my invalid, who had taken his airing in  frock-coat and top-hat, the more readily to assume his present part.
    "What!" cried Raffles, "simply saying to my friend that I'd like to  lift the gold cup?  Why, so I should, officer, so I should! I don't  mind who hears me say so.
  It's one of the most beautiful things I ever  saw in all my life.
"    The constable's face had already relaxed, and now a grin peeped under  the limp moustache.
  "I  daresay there's many as feels like that, sir,"  said he.
    "Exactly; and I say what I feel, that's all," said Raffles airily.
  "But seriously, officer, is a valuable thing like this quite safe in a  case like that?"    "Safe enough as long as I'm here," replied the other, between grim jest  and stout earnest.
  Raffles studied his face; he was still watching  Raffles; and I kept an eye on them both without putting in my word.
    "You appear to be single-handed," observed Raffles.
  "Is that wise?"    The note of anxiety was capitally caught; it was at once personal and  public-spirited, that of the enthusiastic savant, afraid for a national  treasure which few appreciated as he did himself.
  And, to be sure, the  three of us now had this treasury to ourselves; one or two others had  been there when we entered; but now they were gone.
    "I'm not single-handed," said the officer, comfortably.
  "See that seat  by the door?  One of the attendants sits there all day long.
"    "Then where is he now?"    "Talking to another attendant just outside.
  If you listen you'll hear  them for yourself.
"    We listened, and we did hear them, but not just outside.
  In my own  mind I even questioned  whether they were in the corridor through which  we had come; to me it sounded as though they were just outside the  corridor.
    "You mean the fellow with the billiard-cue who was here when we came  in?" pursued Raffles.
    "That wasn't a billiard-cue!  It was a pointer," the intelligent  officer explained.
    "It ought to be a javelin," said Raffles, nervously.
  "It ought to be a  poleaxe!  The public treasure ought to be better guarded than this.
  I  shall write to the Times about it--you see if I don't!"    All at once, yet somehow not so suddenly as to excite suspicion,  Raffles had become the elderly busybody with nerves; why, I could not  for the life of me imagine; and the policeman seemed equally at sea.
    "Lor' bless you, sir," said he, "I'm all right; don't you bother your  head about ME.
"    "But you haven't even got a truncheon!"    "Not likely to want one either.
  You see, sir, it's early as yet; in a  few minutes these here rooms will fill up; and there's safety in  numbers, as they say.
"    "Oh, it will fill up soon, will it?"    "Any minute now, sir.
"    "Ah!"    "It isn't often empty as long as this, sir.
  It's the Jubilee, I  suppose.
"    "Meanwhile, what if my friend and I had been professional thieves?  Why, we could have over-powered you in an instant, my good fellow!"    "That you couldn't; leastways, not without bringing the whole place  about your ears.
"    "Well, I shall write to the Times, all the same.
  I'm a connoisseur in  all this sort of thing, and I won't have unnecessary risks run with the  nation's property.
  You said there was an attendant just  outside, but  he sounds to me as though he were at the other end of the corridor.
  I  shall write to-day!"    For an instant we all three listened; and Raffles was right.
 Then I saw  two things in one glance.
  Raffles had stepped a few inches backward,  and stood poised upon the ball of each foot, his arms half raised, a  light in his eyes.
  And another kind  of light was breaking over the  crass features of our friend the constable.
    "Then shall I tell you what I'LL do?" he cried, with a sudden clutch at  the whistle-chain on his chest.
  The whistle flew out, but it never  reached his lips.
  There were a couple of sharp smacks, like  double  barrels discharged all but simultaneously, and the man reeled against  me so that I could not help catching him as he fell.
    "Well done, Bunny!  I've knocked him out--I've knocked him out! Run you  to the door and see if the attendants have heard anything, and take  them on if they have.
"    Mechanically I did as I was told.
  There was no time for thought, still  less for remonstrance or reproach, though my surprise must have been  even more complete than that of the constable before Raffles knocked  the sense out of him.
  Even in my  utter bewilderment, however, the  instinctive caution of the real criminal did not desert me.
  I ran to  the door, but I sauntered through it, to plant myself before a  Pompeiian fresco in the corridor; and there were the two attendants  still gossiping outside the further door; nor did they hear the dull  crash which I heard even as I watched them out of the corner of each  eye.
    It was hot weather, as I have said, but the perspiration on my body  seemed already to have turned into a skin of ice.
  Then I caught the  faint  reflection of my own face in the casing of the fresco, and it  frightened me into some semblance of myself as Raffles joined me with  his hands in his pockets.
  But my fear and indignation were redoubled  at the sight of him, when a single glance  convinced me that his  pockets were as empty as his hands, and his mad outrage the most wanton  and  reckless of his whole career.
    "Ah, very interesting, very interesting, but nothing to what they have  in the museum at Naples or in Pompeii itself.
  You must go there some  day, Bunny.
  I've a good mind to take you myself.
  Meanwhile--slow  march!  The beggar hasn't moved an eyelid.
  We may swing for him if you  show indecent haste!"    "We!" I whispered.
  "We!"    And my knees knocked together as we came up to the chatting attendants.
  But Raffles must needs interrupt them to ask the way to the Prehistoric  Saloon.
    "At the top of the stairs.
"    "Thank you.
  Then we'll work round that way to the Egyptian part.
"    And we left them resuming their providential chat.
    "I believe you're mad," I said bitterly as we went.
    "I believe I was," admitted Raffles; "but I'm not now, and I'll see you  through.
  A hundred and thirty-nine yards, wasn't it? Then it can't be  more than a hundred and twenty now--not as much.
  Steady, Bunny, for  God's sake.
  It's SLOW march--for our lives.
"    There was this much management.
  The rest was our colossal luck.
 A  hansom was being paid off at the foot of the steps outside, and in we  jumped, Raffles shouting "Charing Cross!" for all Bloomsbury to hear.
    We had turned into Bloomsbury Street without exchanging a syllable when  he struck the trap-door with his fist.
    "Where the devil are you driving us?"    "Charing Cross, sir.
"    "I said King's Cross!  Round you spin, and drive like blazes, or we  miss our train!  There's one to York at 10:35," added Raffles as the  trap-door slammed; "we'll book there, Bunny, and then we'll slope  through the subway to the Metropolitan, and so to ground via Baker  Street and Earl's Court.
"    And actually in half an hour he was seated once more in the hired  carrying chair, while the porter and I staggered upstairs with my  decrepit charge, for whose shattered strength even one hour in Kew  Gardens had proved too much!  Then, and not until then, when we had got  rid of the porter and  were alone at last, did I tell Raffles, in the  most nervous English at my command, frankly and exactly what I thought  of him and of his latest deed.
  Once started, moreover, I spoke as I  have seldom spoken to living man; and Raffles, of all men, stood my  abuse without a murmur; or rather he sat it out, too astounded even to  take off his hat, though I thought his eyebrows would have lifted it  from his head.
    "But it always was your infernal way," I was  savagely concluding.
  "You make one plan, and yet you tell me another--"    "Not to-day, Bunny, I swear!"    "You mean to tell me you really did start with the bare idea of finding  a place to hide in for a night?"    "Of course I did.
"    "It was to be the mere reconnoitre you pretended?"    "There was no pretence about it, Bunny.
"    "Then why on earth go and do what you did?"    "The reason would be obvious to anyone but you," said Raffles, still  with no unkindly scorn.
  "It was the temptation of a minute--the final  impulse of the fraction of a second, when Roberto saw that I was  tempted, and let me see that he saw it.
 It's not a thing I care to do,  and I sha'n't be happy till the papers tell me the poor devil is alive.
  But a knock-out shot was the only chance for us then.
"    "Why?  You don't get run in for being tempted, nor yet for showing that  you are!"    "But I should have deserved running in if I hadn't yielded to such a  temptation as that,  Bunny.
  It was a chance in a hundred thousand!  We  might go there every day of our lives, and never again be the only  outsiders in the room, with  the billiard-marking Johnnie practically  out of ear-shot at one and the same time.
  It was a gift from the gods;  not to have taken it would have been flying in the face of Providence.
"    "But you didn't take it," said I.
  "You went and left it behind.
"    I wish I had had a Kodak for the little smile with which Raffles shook  his head, for it was one that he kept for those great moments of which  our vocation is not devoid.
  All this time he had been wearing his hat,  tilted a little over eyebrows no longer raised.
  And now at last I knew  where the gold cup was.
    It stood for days upon his chimney-piece, this costly trophy whose  ancient history and final fate filled newspaper columns even in these  days of Jubilee, and for which the flower of Scotland Yard was said to  be seeking high and low.
  Our constable, we learnt, had been stunned  only, and, from the moment that I brought him an evening paper with the  news, Raffles's spirits rose to a height inconsistent with his equable  temperament, and as unusual in him as the sudden impulse upon which he  had acted with such effect.
  The cup itself appealed to me no more than  it had done  before.
  Exquisite it might be, handsome it was,  but so  light in the hand that the mere gold of it would scarcely have poured  three figures out of melting-pot.
 And what said Raffles but that he  would never melt it at all!    "Taking it was an offence against the laws of the land, Bunny.
 That is  nothing.
  But destroying it would be a crime against God and Art, and  may I be spitted on the vane of St.
 Mary Abbot's if I commit it!"    Talk such as this was unanswerable; indeed, the whole affair had passed  the pale of useful comment; and the one course left to a practical  person was to shrug his shoulders and enjoy the joke.
 This was not a  little enhanced by the newspaper reports, which described Raffles as a  handsome youth, and his unwilling accomplice as an older man of  blackguardly appearance and low type.
    "Hits us both off rather neatly, Bunny," said he.
  "But what none of  them do justice to is my dear cup.
  Look at it; only look at it, man!  Was ever anything so rich and yet so chaste? St.
 Agnes must have had a  pretty bad time, but it would be almost worth it to go down to  posterity in such enamel upon such gold.
  And then  the history of the  thing.
  Do you realize that it's five hundred years old and has  belonged to Henry  the Eighth and to Elizabeth among others?  Bunny,  when you have me cremated, you can put my ashes in yonder cup, and lay  us in the deep-delved earth together!"    "And meanwhile?"    "It is the joy of my heart, the light of my life, the delight of mine  eye.
"    "And suppose other eyes catch sight of it?"    "They never must; they never shall.
"    Raffles would have been too absurd had he not been thoroughly alive to  his own absurdity; there was nevertheless an underlying sincerity in  his appreciation of any and every  form of beauty, which all his  nonsense could not conceal.
  And his infatuation for the cup was, as he  declared, a very pure passion, since the circumstances debarred him  from the chief joy of the average collector, that of showing his  treasure to his friends.
  At last, however, and at the height  of his  craze, Raffles and reason seemed to come together again as suddenly as  they had parted company in the Room of Gold.
    "Bunny," he cried, flinging his newspaper across the room, "I've got an  idea after your own heart.
  I know where I can place it after all!"    "Do you mean the cup?"    "I do.
"    "Then I congratulate you.
"    "Thanks.
"    "Upon the recovery of your senses.
"    "Thanks galore.
  But you've been confoundedly unsympathetic about this  thing, Bunny, and I don't think I shall tell you my scheme till I've  carried  it out.
"    "Quite time enough," said I.
    "It will mean your letting me loose for an hour or two under cloud of  this very night.
  To-morrow's Sunday, the Jubilee's on Tuesday, and old  Theobald's coming back for it.
"    "It doesn't much matter whether he's back or not if you go late enough.
"    "I mustn't be late.
  They don't keep open.
  No, it's no use your asking  any questions.
  Go out and buy me a big box of Huntley & Palmer's  biscuits; any sort you like, only they must be theirs, and  absolutely  the biggest box they sell.
"    "My dear man!"    "No questions, Bunny; you do your part and I'll do mine.
"    Subtlety and success were in his face.
  It was enough for me, and I had  done his extraordinary bidding within a quarter of an hour.
  In another  minute Raffles had opened the box and tumbled all the biscuits into the  nearest chair.
    "Now newspapers!"    I fetched a pile.
  He bid the cup of gold a ridiculous farewell,  wrapped it up in newspaper after newspaper, and finally packed it in  the empty  biscuit-box.
    "Now some brown paper.
  I don't want to be taken for the grocer's young  man.
"    A neat enough parcel it made, when the string had been tied and the  ends cut close; what was  more difficult was to wrap up Raffles himself  in such a way that even the porter should not recognize him if they  came face to face at the corner.
  And the sun was still up.
  But  Raffles would go, and when he did I should not have known him  myself.
    He may have been an hour away.
  It was barely dusk when he returned,  and my first question referred to our dangerous ally, the porter.
  Raffles had passed him unsuspected in going, but had  managed to avoid  him altogether on the return journey, which he had completed by way of  the other entrance and the roof.
  I breathed again.
    "And what have you done with the cup?"    "Placed it!"    "How much for?  How much for?"    "Let me think.
  I had a couple of cabs, and the postage was a tanner,  with another twopence for registration.
  Yes, it cost me exactly  five-and-eight.
"    "IT cost YOU!  But what did you GET for it, Raffles?"    "Nothing, my boy.
"    "Nothing!"    "Not a crimson cent.
"    "I am not surprised.
  I never thought it had a market value.
  I told  you so in the beginning,"  I said, irritably.
  "But what on earth have  you  done with the thing?"    "Sent it to the Queen.
"    "You haven't!"    Rogue is a word with various meanings, and Raffles had been one sort of  rogue ever since I had known him; but now, for once, he was the  innocent variety, a great gray-haired child, running over with  merriment and mischief.
    "Well, I've sent it to Sir Arthur Bigge, to present to her Majesty,  with the loyal respects of the thief, if that will do for you," said  Raffles.
  "I thought they might take too much stock of me at the G.
P.
O.
  if I addressed it to the Sovereign her-self.
  Yes, I drove over to St.
  Martin's-le-Grand with it, and I registered the box into the bargain.
  Do a thing properly if you do it at all.
"    "But why on earth," I groaned, "do such a thing at all?"    "My dear Bunny, we have been reigned over for sixty years by infinitely  the finest monarch the world has ever seen.
  The world is taking the  present opportunity of signifying the fact for all it is worth.
  Every  nation is laying of its best at her royal feet; every class in the  community is doing its little level--except ours.
  All I have done is  to remove one reproach from our fraternity.
"    At this I came round, was infected with his spirit, called him the  sportsman he always was and would be, and shook his daredevil hand in  mine; but, at the same time, I still had my qualms.
    "Supposing they trace it to us?" said I.
    "There's not much to catch hold of in a biscuit-box by Huntley &  Palmer," replied Raffles; "that was why I sent you for one.
  And I  didn't write  a word upon a sheet of paper which could possibly be  traced.
  I simply printed two or three on a virginal post-card--another  half-penny to the bad--which might have been bought at any post-office  in the kingdom.
  No, old chap, the G.
P.
O.
 was the one real danger;  there was one detective  I spotted for myself; and the sight of him has  left me with a thirst.
  Whisky and Sullivans for two, Bunny, if you  please.
"    Raffles was soon clinking his glass against mine.
    "The Queen," said he.
  "God bless her!"        THE FATE OF FAUSTINA      "Mar--ga--ri,    e perzo a Salvatore!  Mar--ga--ri,    Ma l'ommo e cacciatore!  Mar--ga--ri,    Nun ce aje corpa tu!    Chello ch' e fatto, e fatto, un ne parlammo cchieu!"    A piano-organ was pouring the metallic music through our open windows,  while a voice of brass brayed the words, which I have since  obtained,  and print above for identification by such  as know their Italy better  than I.
  They will not  thank me for reminding them of a tune so lately  epidemic in that land of aloes and blue skies; but at least it is  unlikely to run in their heads as the ribald accompaniment to a  tragedy; and it does in mine.
    It was in the early heat of August, and the hour that of the lawful and  necessary siesta for such as turn night into day.
  I was therefore  shutting my window in a rage, and wondering whether I should  not do  the same for Raffles, when he appeared in the silk pajamas to which the  chronic solicitude of Dr.
 Theobald confined him from morning to  night.
    "Don't do that, Bunny," said he.
  "I rather like that thing, and want  to listen.
  What sort of fellows are they to look at, by the way?"    I put my head out to see, it being a primary rule of our quaint  establishment that Raffles must never show himself at any of the  windows.
  I remember now how hot the sill was to my elbows, as I leant  upon it and looked down, in order to satisfy a curiosity in which I  could see no point.
    "Dirty-looking beggars," said I over my shoulder: "dark as dark; blue  chins, oleaginous curls, and ear-rings; ragged as they make them, but  nothing picturesque in their rags.
"    "Neapolitans all over," murmured Raffles behind me; "and that's a  characteristic touch, the one fellow singing while the other grinds;  they always have that out there.
"    "He's rather a fine chap, the singer," said I, as the song ended.
  "My  hat, what teeth!  He's looking up here, and grinning all round his  head; shall I chuck him anything?"    "Well, I have no reason to love the Neapolitans; but it takes me  back--it takes me back!  Yes, here you are, one each.
"    It was a couple of half-crowns that Raffles put into my hand, but I had  thrown them into the street for pennies before I saw what they were.
  Thereupon I left the Italians bowing to the mud, as well they might,  and I turned to protest against  such wanton waste.
  But Raffles was  walking up and down, his head bent, his eyes troubled; and his one  excuse disarmed remonstrance.
    "They took me back," he repeated.
  "My God, how they took me back!"    Suddenly he stopped in his stride.
    "You don't understand, Bunny, old chap; but if you like you shall.
  I  always meant to tell you  some day, but never felt worked up to it  before,  and it's not the kind of thing one talks about for talking's  sake.
  It isn't a nursery story, Bunny, and there isn't a laugh in it  from start to finish; on the contrary, you have often asked me what  turned my hair gray, and now you are going to hear.
"    This was promising, but Raffles's manner was something more.
  It was  unique in my memory of the man.
  His fine face softened and set hard by  turns.
  I never knew it so hard.
  I never knew it so soft.
  And the  same might be said of his voice, now tender as any woman's, now flying  to the other extreme of equally unwonted ferocity.
  But this was toward  the end of his tale; the beginning he treated characteristically  enough, though I could have wished for a less cavalier account of the  island of Elba, where, upon his own showing, he had met with much  humanity.
    "Deadly, my dear Bunny, is not the word for that glorified snag, or for  the mollusks, its inhabitants.
  But they started by wounding my vanity,  so perhaps I am prejudiced, after all.
  I sprung myself upon them as a  shipwrecked sailor--a sole survivor--stripped in the sea and landed  without a stitch--yet they took no more interest in me than you do in  Italian organ-grinders.
  They were decent enough.
  I didn't have to  pick and steal for a square meal and a pair of trousers; it would have  been more exciting if I had.
  But what a place!  Napoleon couldn't  stand it, you remember, but he held on longer than I did.
  I put in a  few weeks in their infernal mines, simply to pick up a smattering of  Italian; then got across to the mainland in a little wooden  timber-tramp; and ungratefully glad I was to leave Elba blazing in just  such another sunset as the one you won't forget.
    "The tramp was bound for Naples, but first it touched at Baiae, where I  carefully deserted in the night.
  There are too many English in Naples  itself, though I thought it would make a first happy hunting-ground  when I knew the language better and had altered myself a bit more.
  Meanwhile I got a billet of several sorts on one of the loveliest spots  that ever I struck on all my travels.
  The place was a vineyard, but it  overhung the sea, and I got taken on as tame sailorman and emergency  bottle-washer.
  The wages were the noble figure of a lira and a half,  which is just over a bob, a day, but there were lashings of sound wine  for one and all, and better wine to bathe in.
  And for eight whole  months, my boy, I was an absolutely honest man.
  The luxury of it,  Bunny!  I out-heroded Herod, wouldn't touch a grape, and went in the  most delicious danger of being knifed for my principles by the thieving  crew I had joined.
    "It was the kind of place where every prospect pleases--and all the  rest of it--especially all the rest.
  But may I see it in my dreams  till I die--as it was in the beginning--before anything began to  happen.
  It was a wedge of rock sticking out into the bay, thatched  with vines, and with the rummiest old house on the very edge of all, a  devil of a height above the sea: you might have sat at the windows and  dropped your Sullivan-ends plumb into blue water a hundred and fifty  feet below.
    "From the garden behind the house--such a garden, Bunny--oleanders and  mimosa, myrtles, rosemarys and red tangles of fiery, untamed  flowers--in a corner of this garden was the top of a subterranean stair  down to the sea; at least there were nearly two hundred steps tunnelled  through the solid rock; then an iron gate, and another eighty steps in  the open air; and last of all a cave fit for pirates,  a-penny-plain-and-two-pence-colored.
 This cave gave upon the sweetest  little thing in coves, all deep blue water and honest rocks; and here I  looked after the vineyard shipping, a pot-bellied tub with a brown  sail, and a sort of dingy.
  The tub took the wine to Naples, and the  dingy was the tub's tender.
    "The house above was said to be on the identical site of a suburban  retreat of the admirable Tiberius; there was the old sinner's private  theatre with the tiers cut clean to this day, the well where he used to  fatten his lampreys on his slaves, and a  ruined temple of those  ripping old Roman bricks, shallow as dominoes and ruddier than the  cherry.
  I never was much of an antiquary, but I could have become one  there if I'd had nothing else to  do; but I had lots.
  When I wasn't  busy with the  boats I had to trim the vines, or gather the grapes,  or  even help make the wine itself in a cool, dark, musty vault underneath  the temple, that I can see and smell as I jaw.
  And can't I hear it and  feel it too!  Squish, squash, bubble; squash, squish, guggle; and your  feet as though you had been wading through slaughter to a throne.
  Yes,  Bunny, you mightn't think it, but this good right foot, that never was  on the wrong side of the crease when the ball left my hand, has also  been known to           'crush the lees of pleasure           From sanguine grapes of pain.
'"    He made a sudden pause, as though he had stumbled on the truth in jest.
  His face filled with lines.
  We were sitting in the room that had been  bare when first I saw it; there were basket-chairs and a table in it  now, all meant ostensibly for me; and hence Raffles would slip to his  bed, with schoolboy relish, at every tinkle of the bell.
  This  afternoon we felt fairly safe, for Theobald had called in the morning,  and Mrs. Theobald still took up much of his time.
  Through the open  window we could hear the piano-organ and "Mar--gar--ri" a  few hundred  yards further on.
  I fancied Raffles was listening to it while he  paused.
  He shook his head abstractedly when I handed him the  cigarettes; and his tone hereafter was never just what it had been.
    "I don't know, Bunny, whether you're a believer in transmigration of  souls.
  I have often thought it easier to believe than lots of other  things, and I have been pretty near believing in it myself since I had  my being on that villa of Tiberius.
  The brute who had it in my day, if  he isn't still running it with a whole skin, was or is as cold-blooded  a blackguard as the worst of the emperors, but I have often thought he  had a lot in common with Tiberius.
  He had the great high sensual Roman  nose, eyes that were sinks of iniquity in themselves, and that swelled  with fatness, like the rest of him, so that he wheezed if he walked a  yard; otherwise rather a fine beast to look at, with a huge gray  moustache, like a flying gull, and the most courteous manners even  to  his men; but one of the worst, Bunny, one of the worst that ever was.
  It was said that the vineyard was only his hobby; if so, he did his  best to make his hobby pay.
  He used to come out from Naples for the  week-ends--in the tub when it wasn't too rough for his nerves--and he  didn't always come alone.
  His very name sounded unhealthy--Corbucci.
  I suppose I ought to add that he was a Count, though Counts are  two-a-penny in  Naples, and in season all the year round.
    "He had a little English, and liked to air it upon me, much to my  disgust; if I could not hope to conceal my nationality as yet, I at  least did not want to have it advertised; and the swine had English  friends.
  When he heard that I was bathing in November, when the bay is  still as warm  as new milk, he would shake his wicked old head and say,  'You are very audashuss--you are very audashuss!' and put on no end of  side before his Italians.
  By God, he had pitched upon the right word  unawares, and I let him know it in the end!    "But that bathing, Bunny; it was absolutely the best I ever had  anywhere.
  I said just now the water was like wine; in my own mind I  used to call it blue champagne, and was rather annoyed that I had no  one to admire the phrase.
  Otherwise I assure you that I missed my own  particular kind very little indeed, though I often wished that YOU were  there, old chap; particularly when I went for my lonesome swim; first  thing in the morning, when the Bay was all rose-leaves, and last thing  at night, when your body caught phosphorescent fire!  Ah, yes, it was a  good enough life for a change; a perfect paradise to lie low in;  another Eden until .
.
.
    "My poor Eve!"    And he fetched a sigh that took away his words; then his jaws snapped  together, and his eyes spoke terribly while he conquered his emotion.
  I pen the last word advisedly.
  I fancy it is one which  I have never  used before in writing of A.
 J.
 Raffles,  for I cannot at the moment  recall any other occasion upon which its use would have been justified.
  On resuming, however, he was not only calm, but cold; and this flying  for safety to the other extreme is the single instance of self-distrust  which the present Achates can record to the credit of his impious  AEneas.
    "I called the girl Eve," said he.
  "Her real name was Faustina, and she  was one of a vast family who hung out in a hovel on the inland border  of the vineyard.
  And Aphrodite rising from the sea was less wonderful  and not more beautiful than Aphrodite emerging from that hole!    "It was the most exquisite face I ever saw or shall see in this life.
  Absolutely perfect features; a skin that reminded you of old gold, so  delicate was its bronze; magnificent hair, not black but nearly; and  such eyes and teeth as would have made the fortune of a face without  another point.
  I tell you, Bunny, London would go mad about a girl  like that.
  But I don't believe there's such  another in the world.
  And there she was wasting her sweetness upon that lovely but desolate  little corner of it! Well, she did not waste it upon me.
  I would have  married her, and lived happily ever after in such a hovel as her  people's--with her.
  Only to look at her--only to look at her for the  rest of my days--I could have lain low and remained dead even to you!  And that's all I'm going to tell you about that, Bunny; cursed be he  who tells more!  Yet don't run away with the idea that this poor  Faustina was the only woman I ever cared about.
 I don't believe in all  that 'only' rot; nevertheless I tell you that she was the one being who  ever entirely satisfied my sense of beauty; and I honestly believe I  could have chucked the world and been true to Faustina for that alone.
    "We met sometimes in the little temple I told you about, sometimes  among the vines; now by honest accident, now by flagrant design; and  found a ready-made rendezvous, romantic as one could wish, in the cave  down all those subterranean steps.
 Then the sea would call us--my blue  champagne--my sparkling cobalt--and there was the dingy  ready to our  hand.
  Oh, those nights!  I never knew which I liked best, the moonlit  ones when you sculled through silver and could see for miles, or the  dark nights when the fishermen's torches stood for the sea, and a red  zig-zag in the sky for old Vesuvius.
  We were happy.
  I don't mind  owning it.
  We seemed not to have a care between us.
  My mates took no  interest in my affairs, and Faustina's family did not appear to bother  about her.
  The Count was in Naples five nights of the seven; the other  two we sighed apart.
    "At first it was the oldest story in literature--Eden plus Eve.
 The  place had been a heaven on earth before, but now it was heaven itself.
  So for a little; then one night, a Monday night, Faustina burst out  crying in the boat; and sobbed her story as we drifted without mishap  by the mercy of the Lord.
  And that was almost as old a story as the  other.
    "She was engaged--what!  Had I never heard of it?  Did I mean to upset  the boat?  What was her engagement beside our love? 'Niente, niente,'  crooned Faustina, sighing yet smiling through her tears.
  No, but what  did matter was that the man had threatened to stab her to the  heart--and  would do it as soon as look at her--that I knew.
    "I knew it merely from my knowledge of the Neapolitans, for I had no  idea who the man might  be.
  I knew it, and yet I took this detail  better than the fact of the engagement, though now I began to laugh at  both.
  As if I was going to let her marry anybody else!  As if a hair  of her lovely head should be touched while I lived to protect her!  I  had a great mind to row away to blazes with her that very night, and  never go near the vineyard again, or let her either.
  But we had not a  lira between us at the time, and only the rags in which we sat barefoot  in the boat.
  Besides, I had to know the name of the animal who had  threatened a woman, and such a woman as this.
    "For a long time she refused to tell me, with splendid obduracy; but I  was as determined as she; so at last she made conditions.
 I was not to  go and get put in prison for sticking a knife into him--he wasn't worth  it--and I did promise not to stab him in the back.
  Faustina seemed  quite satisfied, though a little puzzled by my manner, having herself  the racial tolerance for cold steel; and next moment she had taken away  my breath.
  'It is Stefano,' she whispered, and hung her head.
    "And well she might, poor thing!  Stefano, of all creatures on God's  earth--for her!    "Bunny, he was a miserable little undersized  wretch--ill-favored--servile--surly--and second only to his master in  bestial cunning and hypocrisy.
  His face was enough for me; that was  what I read in it, and I don't often make mistakes.
  He was Corbucci's  own confidential body-servant, and that alone was enough to damn him in  decent eyes:  always came out first on the Saturday with the spese, to  have all ready for his master and current mistress, and stayed behind  on the Monday to clear and lock up.
  Stefano!  That worm!  I  could  well understand his threatening a woman  with a knife; what beat me was  how any woman could ever have listened to him; above all, that Faustina  should be the one!  It passed my comprehension.
  But I questioned her  as gently as I could; and her explanation was largely the thread-bare  one you would expect.
  Her parents were so poor.
 They were so many in  family.
  Some of  them begged--would I promise never to tell?  Then  some of them stole--sometimes--and all knew the pains of actual want.
  She looked after the cows, but there were only two of them, and  brought the milk to the vineyard and elsewhere; but that was not  employment for more than one; and there were countless sisters waiting  to take her place.
  Then he was so rich, Stefano.
    "'Rich!' I echoed.
  'Stefano?'    "'Si, Arturo mio.
'    "Yes, I played the game on that vineyard, Bunny, even to going my own  first name.
    "'And how comes he to be rich?' I asked, suspiciously.
    "She did not know; but he had given her such beautiful jewels; the  family had lived on them for months, she pretending an avocat had taken  charge of them for her against her marriage.
 But I cared nothing about  all that.
    "'Jewels!  Stefano!' I could only mutter.
    "'Perhaps the Count has paid for some of them.
  He is very kind.
'    "'To you, is he?'    "'Oh, yes, very kind.
'    "'And you would live in his house afterwards?'    "'Not now, mia cara--not now!'    "'No, by God you don't!' said I in English.
  'But you would have done  so, eh?'    "'Of course.
  That was arranged.
  The Count is really very kind.
'    "'Do you see anything of him when he comes here?'    "Yes, he had sometimes brought her little presents, sweetmeats,  ribbons, and the like; but the offering had always been made through  this toad of a Stefano.
  Knowing the men, I now knew all.
  But  Faustina, she had the pure and simple heart, and the white soul, by the  God who made it, and for all her kindness to a tattered scapegrace who  made love to her in broken Italian between the ripples and the stars.
  She was not to know what I was, remember; and beside Corbucci and his  henchman I was the Archangel Gabriel come down  to earth.
    "Well, as I lay awake that night, two more lines of Swinburne came into  my head, and came to  stay:           "God said 'Let him who wins her take           And keep Faustine.
'    "On that couplet I slept at last, and it was my text and watchword when  I awoke in the morning.
  I forget how well you know your Swinburne,  Bunny; but don't you run away with the idea that there was anything  else in common between his Faustine and mine.
  For the last time let me  tell you that poor Faustina was the whitest and the best I ever knew.
    "Well, I was strung up for trouble when the next Saturday came, and  I'll tell you what I had done.
  I had broken the pledge and burgled  Corbucci's villa in my best manner during his absence in Naples.
  Not  that it gave me the slightest trouble; but no human being could have  told that I had been in, when I came out.
 And I had stolen nothing,  mark you, but only borrowed a revolver from a drawer in the Count's  desk, with one or two trifling accessories; for by this time I had the  measure of these damned Neapolitans.
  They are spry enough with a  knife, but you show them the  business end of a shooting-iron, and  they'll streak like rabbits for the nearest hole.
  But the revolver  wasn't for my own use.
  It was for Faustina, and I taught her how to  use it in the cave down there by the sea, shooting at candles stuck  upon the rock.
  The noise in the cave was something frightful, but high  up above it couldn't be heard at all, as  we proved to each other's  satisfaction pretty early in the proceedings.
  So now Faustina was  armed with munitions of self-defence; and I knew enough of her  character to entertain no doubt as to their spirited use upon occasion.
  Between the two of us, in fact, our friend Stefano seemed tolerably  certain of a warm week-end.
    "But the Saturday brought word that the Count was not coming this week,  being in Rome on business, and unable to return in time; so for a whole  Sunday we were promised peace; and made bold  plans accordingly.
  There  was no further merit in hushing this thing up.
  'Let him who wins her  take and keep Faustine.
' Yes, but let him win her openly, or lose her  and be damned to him!  So on the Sunday I was going to have it out with  her people--with the Count and Stefano as soon as they showed their  noses.
  I had no inducement, remember, ever to return to surreptitious  life within a cab-fare of Wormwood Scrubbs.
 Faustina and the Bay of  Naples were quite good enough for me.
 And the prehistoric man in me  rather exulted in the idea of fighting for my desire.
    "On the Saturday, however, we were able to meet for the last time as  heretofore--just once more in secret--down there in the cave--as soon  as might be after dark.
  Neither of us minded if we were kept for  hours; each knew in the end that the other would come; and there was a  charm of its own even in waiting with such knowledge.
  But that night I  did lose patience: not in the cave, but up above, where first on one  pretext and then on another the direttore kept me going until I smelt a  rat.
  He was not given to exacting overtime, this direttore, whose only  fault was his servile subjection to our common boss.
  It seemed pretty  obvious, therefore, that he was acting upon some secret instructions  from Corbucci himself, and, the moment I suspected this, I asked him to  his face if it was not the case.
  And it was; he admitted it with many  shrugs, being a conveniently weak person, whom one felt almost ashamed  of bullying as the occasion demanded.
    "The fact was, however, that the Count had sent for him on finding he  had to go to Rome, and had said he was very sorry to go just then, as  among other things he intended to speak to me about Faustina.
  Stefano  had told him all about his row with her, and moreover that it was on my  account, which Faustina had never told me, though I had guessed as much  for myself.
  Well, the Count was going to take his jackal's part for  all he was worth, which was just exactly what I had expected him to do.
  He intended going for me on his return, but meanwhile I was not to make  hay in his absence, and so this tool of a direttore had orders to keep  me at it night and day.
  I undertook not to give the poor beast away,  but at the same time told him I had not the faintest intention of doing  another stroke of work that night.
    "It was very dark, and I remember knocking my head against the oranges  as I ran up the long, shallow steps which ended the journey between the  direttore's lodge and the villa itself.
  But at the  back of the villa  was the garden I spoke about, and also a bare chunk of the cliff where  it was bored by that subterranean stair.
  So I saw the stars  close  overhead, and the fishermen's torches far below, the coastwise lights  and the crimson hieroglyph that spelt Vesuvius, before I plunged into  the darkness of the shaft.
  And that was the last time I appreciated  the unique and peaceful charm of this outlandish spot.
    "The stair was in two long flights, with an air-hole or two at the top  of the upper one, but not another pin-prick till you came to the iron  gate at the bottom of the lower.
  As you may read of an infinitely  lighter place, in a finer work of fiction than you are ever likely to  write, Bunny, it was 'gloomy at noon, dark as midnight at dusk, and  black as the ninth plague of Egypt at midnight.
'  I won't swear to my  quotation, but I will to those  stairs.
  They were as black that night  as the inside  of the safest safe in the strongest strong-room in the  Chancery Lane Deposit.
  Yet I had not got far down them with my bare  feet before I heard somebody else coming up in boots.
  You may imagine  what a turn that gave me!  It could not be Faustina, who went barefoot  three seasons of the four, and yet there was Faustina waiting for me  down below.
  What a fright she must have had!  And all at once my own  blood ran cold: for the man sang like a kettle as he plodded up and up.
  It was, it must be, the short-winded Count himself, whom we all  supposed to be in Rome!    "Higher he came and nearer, nearer, slowly yet hurriedly, now stopping  to cough and gasp, now taking a few steps by elephantine assault.
  I  should have enjoyed the situation if it had not been  for poor Faustina  in the cave; as it was I was filled with nameless fears.
  But I could  not resist giving that grampus Corbucci one bad moment on account.
  A  crazy hand-rail ran up one wall, so I  carefully flattened myself  against the other, and  he passed within six inches of me, puffing and  wheezing like a brass band.
  I let him go a few steps higher, and then  I let him have it with both lungs.
    "Buona sera, eccellenza, signori!' I roared  after him.
  And a scream  came down in answer--such a scream!  A dozen different terrors were in  it; and the wheezing had stopped, with the old scoundrel's heart.
    "'Chi sta la?' he squeaked at last, gibbering and whimpering like a  whipped monkey, so that I could not bear to miss his face, and got a  match all ready to strike.
    "'Arturo, signori.
'    "He didn't repeat my name, nor did he damn me in heaps.
  He did nothing  but wheeze for a good minute, and when he spoke it was with insinuating  civility, in his best English.
    "'Come nearer, Arturo.
  You are in the lower regions down there.
 I want  to speak with you.
'    "'No, thanks.
  I'm in a hurry,' I said, and dropped that match back  into my pocket.
  He  might be armed, and I was not.
    "'So you are in a 'urry!' and he wheezed amusement.
  'And you thought I  was still in Rome, no doubt; and so I was until this afternoon, when I  caught train at the eleventh moment, and then another train from Naples  to Pozzuoli.
  I have been rowed here now by a fisherman of Pozzuoli.
  I  had not time to stop anywhere in Naples, but only to drive from station  to station.
  So I am without Stefano, Arturo, I am without Stefano.
'    "His sly voice sounded preternaturally sly in the absolute darkness,  but even through that impenetrable veil I knew it for a sham.
  I had  laid hold of the hand-rail.
  It shook violently in my hand; he also was  holding it where he stood.
  And  these suppressed tremors, or rather  their detection in this way, struck a strange chill to my heart, just  as I was beginning to pluck it up.
    "'It is lucky for Stefano,' said I, grim as death.
    "'Ah, but you must not be too 'ard on 'im,' remonstrated the Count.
  'You have stole his girl, he speak with me about it, and I wish to  speak with you.
  It is very audashuss, Arturo, very audashuss!  Perhaps  you are even going to meet her now, eh?'"    I told him straight that I was.
    "'Then there is no 'urry, for she is not there.
'    "'You didn't see her in the cave?' I cried, too delighted at the  thought to keep it to  myself.
    "'I had no such fortune,' the old devil said.
    "'She is there, all the same.
'    "'I only wish I 'ad known.
'    "'And I've kept her long enough!'    "In fact I threw this over my shoulder as I turned and went running  down.
    "'I 'ope you will find her!' his malicious voice came croaking after  me.
  'I 'ope you will--I 'ope so.
'    "And find her I did.
"    Raffles had been on his feet some time, unable to sit still or to  stand, moving excitedly about the room.
  But now he stood still enough,  his elbows on the cast-iron mantelpiece, his head between his  hands.
    "Dead?" I whispered.
    And he nodded to the wall.
    "There was not a sound in the cave.
  There was no answer to my voice.
  Then I went in, and my foot touched hers, and it was colder than the  rock .
.
.
  Bunny, they had stabbed her to the heart.
  She had fought  them, and they had stabbed her to the heart!"    "You say 'they,'" I said gently, as he stood in heavy silence, his back  still turned.
  "I thought Stefano had been left behind?"    Raffles was round in a flash, his face white-hot, his eyes dancing  death.
    "He was in the cave!" he shouted.
  "I saw him--I spotted him--it was  broad twilight after those stairs--and I went for him with my bare  hands.
  Not fists, Bunny; not fists for a thing like that; I meant  getting my fingers into his vile little heart and tearing it out by the  roots.
  I was stark mad.
  But he had the revolver--hers.
  He blazed it  at arm's length, and missed.
  And that steadied me.
  I had smashed his  funny-bone against the rock before he could blaze again; the revolver  fell with  a rattle, but without going off; in an instant I had it  tight, and the little swine at my mercy at last.
"    "You didn't show him any?"    "Mercy?  With Faustina dead at my feet? I should have deserved none in  the next world if I had shown him any in this!  No, I just stood over  him, with the revolver in both hands, feeling the chambers with my  thumb; and as I stood he stabbed at me; but I stepped back to that one,  and brought him down with a bullet in his guts.
    "'And I can spare you two or three more,' I said, for my poor girl  could not have fired a shot.
  'Take that one to hell with you--and  that--and that!'    "Then I started coughing and wheezing like the Count himself, for the  place was full of smoke.
  When it cleared my man was very dead, and I  tipped him into the sea, to defile that rather than Faustina's cave.
  And then--and then--we were  alone for the last time, she and I, in our  own pet  haunt; and I could scarcely see her, yet I would not strike a  match, for I knew she would not have me see her as she was.
  I could  say good-by to her without that.
  I said it; and I left her like a man,  and up the first open-air steps with my head in the air and the stars  all sharp in the sky; then suddenly they swam, and back I went like a  lunatic, to see if she was really dead, to bring her back to life .
.
.
  Bunny, I can't tell you any more.
"    "Not of the Count?" I murmured at last.
    "Not even of the Count," said Raffles, turning round with a sigh.
  "I  left him pretty sorry for himself; but what was the good of that?  I  had taken blood for blood, and it was not Corbucci who had killed  Faustina.
  No, the plan was his,  but that was not part of the plan.
  They had found out about our meetings in the cave: nothing simpler than  to have me kept hard at it overhead and to carry off Faustina by brute  force in the boat.
  It was their only chance, for she had said more to  Stefano than she had admitted to me, and more than I am going to repeat  about myself.
  No persuasion would have induced her to listen to him  again; so they tried force; and she drew Corbucci's revolver on them,  but they had taken her by surprise, and Stefano stabbed her before she  could fire.
"    "But how do you know all that?" I asked Raffles, for his tale was going  to pieces in the telling, and the tragic end of poor Faustina was no  ending for me.
    "Oh," said he, "I had it from Corbucci at his own revolver's point.
  He  was waiting at his window, and I could have potted him at my ease where  he stood against the light listening hard enough  but not seeing a  thing.
  So he asked whether it was Stefano, and I whispered, 'Si,  signore'; and then whether he had finished Arturo, and I brought the  same shot off again.
  He had let me in before he knew who was finished  and who was not.
"    "And did you finish him?"    "No; that was too good for Corbucci.
  But I bound and gagged him about  as tight as man was ever gagged or bound, and I left him in his room  with the shutters shut and the house locked up.
  The shutters of that  old place were six inches thick, and the walls nearly six feet; that  was on the Saturday night, and the Count wasn't expected at the  vineyard before the following Saturday.
 Meanwhile he was supposed to be  in Rome.
  But the dead would doubtless be discovered next day, and I am  afraid this would lead to his own discovery with the life still in him.
  I believe he  figured on that himself, for he sat threatening me gamely  till the last.
  You never saw such a sight as he was, with his head  split in two by a ruler tied at the back of it, and his great moustache  pushed up into his bulging eyes.
  But I locked him  up in the dark  without a qualm, and I wished and still wish him every torment of the  damned.
"    "And then?"    "The night was still young, and within ten miles there was the best of  ports in a storm, and hundreds of holds for the humble stowaway to  choose from.
  But I didn't want to go further than Genoa, for by this  time my Italian would wash, so I chose the old Norddeutscher Lloyd, and  had an excellent voyage in one of the boats slung in-board over the  bridge.
  That's better than any hold, Bunny, and I did splendidly on  oranges brought from the vineyard.
"    "And at Genoa?"    "At Genoa I took to my wits once more, and have been living on nothing  else ever since.
  But there I had to begin all over again, and at the  very bottom of the ladder.
  I slept in the streets.
  I begged.
  I did  all manner of terrible things, rather hoping for a bad end, but never  coming to one.
  Then one day I saw a white-headed old chap looking at  me through a shop-window--a window I had designs upon--and when I  stared at him he stared at me--and we wore the same rags.
  So I had  come to that!  But one reflection makes many.
  I had not recognized  myself; who on earth would recognize me?  London called me--and here I  am.
 Italy had broken my heart--and there it stays.
"    Flippant as a schoolboy one moment, playful even in the bitterness of  the next, and now no longer giving way to the feeling which had spoilt  the climax of his tale, Raffles needed knowing as I alone knew him for  a right appreciation of those last words.
  That they were no mere words  I know full well.
 That, but for the tragedy of his Italian life, that  life would have sufficed him for years, if not for ever, I did and do  still believe.
  But I alone see him as I saw him then, the lines upon  his face, and the pain behind the lines; how they came to disappear,  and what removed them, you will never guess.
  It was the one thing you  would have expected to have the opposite effect, the thing indeed that  had forced his confidence, the organ and the voice once more beneath  our very windows:           "Margarita de Parete,           era a' sarta d' e' signore;           se pugneva sempe e ddete           pe penzare a Salvatore!         "Mar--ga--ri,           e perzo e Salvatore!        Mar--ga--ri,           Ma l'ommo e cacciatore!        Mar--ga--ri,           Nun ce aje corpa tu!        Chello ch' e fatto, e fatto, un ne parlammo cchieu!"    I simply stared at Raffles.
  Instead of deepening, his lines had  vanished.
  He looked years younger, mischievous and merry and alert as  I remembered him of old in the breathless crisis of some madcap  escapade.
  He was holding up his finger; he was stealing to the window;  he was peeping through the blind as though our side street were  Scotland Yard itself; he was stealing back again, all revelry,  excitement, and suspense.
    "I half thought they were after me before," said he.
  "That was why I  made you look.
  I daren't take a proper look myself, but what a jest if  they were!  What a jest!"    "Do you mean the police?" said I.
    "The police!  Bunny, do you know them and me so little that you can  look me in the face and ask  such a question?  My boy, I'm dead to  them--off their books--a good deal deader than being off the hooks!  Why, if I went to Scotland Yard this minute, to give myself up, they'd  chuck me out for a harmless lunatic.
  No, I fear an enemy nowadays, and  I go in terror of the sometime friend, but I have the utmost confidence  in the dear police.
"    "Then whom do you mean?"    "The Camorra!"    I repeated the word with a different intonation.
  Not that I had never  heard of that most powerful and sinister of secret societies; but I  failed to see on what grounds Raffles should jump to the conclusion  that these everyday organ-grinders belonged to it.
    "It was one of Corbucci's threats," said he.
  "If I killed him the  Camorra would certainly kill me; he kept on telling me so; it was like  his cunning not to say that he would put them on my tracks whether or  no.
"    "He is probably a member himself!"    "Obviously, from what he said.
"    "But why on earth should you think that these fellows are?" I demanded,  as that brazen voice came rasping through a second verse.
    "I don't think.
  It was only an idea.
  That thing is so thoroughly  Neapolitan, and I never heard it on a London organ before.
  Then again,  what should bring them back here?"    I peeped through the blind in my turn; and, to be sure, there was the  fellow with the blue chin  and the white teeth watching our windows,  and ours only, as he bawled.
    "And why?" cried Raffles, his eyes dancing when I told him.
    "Why should they come sneaking  back to us?  Doesn't that look  suspicious, Bunny; doesn't that promise a lark?"    "Not to me," I said, having the smile for once.
  "How many people,  should you imagine, toss them five shilling for as many minutes of  their infernal row?  You seem to forget that's what you did an hour  ago!"    Raffles had forgotten.
  His blank face confessed the fact.
  Then  suddenly he burst outlaughing at  himself.
    "Bunny," said he, "you've no imagination, and I never knew I had so  much!  Of course you're right.
  I only wish you were not, for there's  nothing I should enjoy more than taking on another Neapolitan or two.
  You see, I owe them something still!  I didn't settle in full.
  I owe  them  more than ever I shall pay them on this side Styx!"    He had hardened even as he spoke: the lines and the years had come  again, and his eyes were flint and steel, with an honest grief behind  the glitter.
        THE LAST LAUGH    As I have had occasion to remark elsewhere, the pick of our exploits,  from a frankly criminal point of view, are of least use for the  comparatively pure purposes of these papers.
  They might be appreciated  in a trade journal (if only  that want could be supplied), by skilled  manipulators of the jemmy and the large light bunch; but, as records of  unbroken yet insignificant success, they would be found at once too  trivial and too technical, if not sordid and unprofitable into the  bargain.
  The latter epithets, and worse, have indeed already been  applied, if not to Raffles and all his works, at least to mine upon  Raffles, by more than one worthy wielder of a virtuous pen.
  I need not  say how heartily I disagree with that truly  pious opinion.
  So far  from admitting a single word of it, I maintain it is the liveliest  warning that I am giving to the world.
  Raffles was a genius, and he  could not make it pay!  Raffles had invention, resource, incomparable  audacity, and a  nerve in ten thousand.
 He was both strategian and  tactician, and we all now know the difference between the two.
  Yet for  months he had been hiding like a rat in a hole, unable to show even his  altered face by night or day without risk, unless another risk were  courted by three inches of conspicuous crepe.
  Then thus far our  rewards had oftener than not been no reward at all.
  Altogether it was  a very different story from the old festive, unsuspected, club and  cricket days, with their noctes ambrosianae at the Albany.
    And now, in addition to the eternal peril of recognition, there was yet  another menace of which I knew nothing.
  I thought no more of our  Neapolitan organ-grinders, though I did often think of the moving page  that they had torn for me out of my friend's strange life in Italy.
  Raffles never alluded to the subject again, and for my part I had  entirely forgotten his wild ideas connecting the organ-grinders with  the Camorra, and imagining them upon his own tracks.
  I heard no more  of it, and thought as little, as I say.
  Then one night in the  autumn--I shrink from shocking the susceptible for nothing--but there  was a certain house in Palace Gardens, and when we got there Raffles  would pass on.
  I could see no soul in sight, no glimmer in the  windows.
  But Raffles had my arm,  and on we went without talking about  it.
  Sharp to the left on the Notting Hill side, sharper still up  Silver Street, a little tacking west and south, a plunge across High  Street, and presently we were home.
    "Pyjamas first," said Raffles, with as much authority as though it  mattered.
  It was a warm night, however, though September, and I did  not mind until I came in clad as he commanded to find the autocrat  himself still booted and capped.
  He was peeping through the blind, and  the gas was still turned down.
  But he said that I could turn it up, as  he helped himself to a cigarette and nothing with it.
    "May I mix you one?" said I.
    "No, thanks.
"    "What's the trouble?"    "We were followed.
"    "Never!"    "You never saw it.
"    "But YOU never looked round.
"    "I have an eye at the back of each ear, Bunny.
"    I helped myself and I fear with less moderation than might have been  the case a minute before.
    "So that was why--"    "That was why," said Raffles, nodding; but he did not smile, and I put  down my glass untouched.
    "They were following us then!"    "All up Palace Gardens.
"    "I thought you wound about coming back over the hill.
"    "Nevertheless, one of them's in the street below at this moment.
"    No, he was not fooling me.
  He was very grim.
  And he had not taken off  a thing; perhaps he did not think it worth while.
    "Plain clothes?" I sighed, following the sartorial train of thought,  even to the loathly arrows  that had decorated my person once already  for a little aeon.
  Next time they would give me double.
  The skilly  was in my stomach when I saw Raffles's face.
    "Who said it was the police, Bunny?" said he.
  "It's the Italians.
  They're only after me; they  won't hurt a hair of YOUR head, let alone  cropping it!  Have a drink, and don't mind me.
 I shall score them off  before I'm done.
"    "And I'll help you!"    "No, old chap, you won't.
  This is my own little show.
  I've known  about it for weeks.
  I  first tumbled to it the day those Neapolitans  came back with their organs, though I didn't seriously  suspect things  then; they never came again, those two, they had done their part.
  That's the Camorra  all over, from all accounts.
  The Count I told you  about is pretty high up in it, by the way he spoke, but there will be  grades and grades between him  and the organ-grinders.
  I shouldn't be  surprised if he had every low-down Neapolitan ice-creamer in the town  upon my tracks!  The organization's  incredible.
  Then do you remember  the superior foreigner who came to the door a few days afterwards?  You  said he had velvet eyes.
"    "I never connected him with those two!"    "Of course you didn't, Bunny, so you threatened to kick the fellow  downstairs, and only made them keener on the scent.
  It was too late to  say anything when you told me.
  But the very next time I showed my nose  outside I heard a camera click as I passed, and the fiend was a person  with velvet eyes.
  Then there was a lull--that happened weeks ago.
  They had sent me to Italy for identification by Count Corbucci.
"    "But this is all theory," I exclaimed.
  "How on earth can you know?"    "I don't know," said Raffles, "but I should like to bet.
  Our friend  the bloodhound is hanging  about the corner near the pillar-box; look  through my window, it's dark in there, and tell me who  he is.
"    The man was too far away for me to swear to his face, but he wore a  covert-coat of un-English length, and the lamp across the road played  steadily on his boots; they were very yellow, and they  made no noise  when he took a turn.
  I strained my  eyes, and all at once I remembered  the thin-soled, low-heeled, splay yellow boots of the insidious  foreigner, with the soft eyes and the brown-paper face, whom I had  turned from the door as a palpable fraud.
  The ring at the bell was the  first I had heard of him, there had been no warning step upon the  stairs, and my suspicious eye had searched his feet for rubber soles.
    "It's the fellow," I said, returning to Raffles, and I described his  boots.
    Raffles was delighted.
    "Well done, Bunny; you're coming on," said  he.
  "Now I wonder if he's  been over here all the time, or if they sent him over expressly?  You  did better than you think in spotting those boots, for they can only  have been made in Italy, and that looks like the special envoy.
  But  it's no use speculating.
  I must find out.
"    "How can you?"    "He won't stay there all night.
"    "Well?"    "When he gets tired of it I shall return the compliment and follow HIM.
"    "Not alone," said I, firmly.
    "Well, we'll see.
  We'll see at once," said Raffles, rising.
 "Out with  the gas, Bunny, while I take a look.
  Thank you.
  Now wait a bit .
.
.
 yes!  He's chucked it; he's off already; and so am I!"    But I slipped to our outer door, and held the passage.
    "I don't let you go alone, you know.
"    "You can't come with me in pyjamas.
"    "Now I see why you made me put them on!"    "Bunny, if you don't shift I shall have to shift you.
  This is my very  own private one-man show.
  But I'll be back in an hour--there!"    "You swear?"    "By all my gods.
"    I gave in.
  How could I help giving in?  He did not look the man that  he had been, but you never knew with Raffles, and I could not have him  lay a hand on me.
  I let him go with a shrug and my blessing, then ran  into his room to see the last of him from the window.
    The creature in the coat and boots had reached the end of our little  street, where he appeared to have hesitated, so that Raffles was just  in time to see which way he turned.
  And Raffles was after him at an  easy pace, and had himself almost reached the corner when my attention  was distracted from the alert nonchalance of his gait.
  I was  marvelling that it alone had not long ago betrayed him, for nothing  about him was so unconsciously characteristic, when suddenly I realized  that Raffles was not the only person in the little lonely street.
  Another pedestrian had entered from the other end, a man heavily built  and clad, with an astrakhan collar to his coat on this warm  night, and  a black slouch hat that hid his features  from my bird's-eye view.
  His  steps were the short and shuffling ones of a man advanced in years and  in fatty degeneration, but of a sudden they stopped beneath my very  eyes.
  I could have dropped a  marble into the dinted crown of the  black felt hat.
  Then, at the same moment, Raffles turned the corner  without looking round, and the big man below raised both his hands and  his face.
 Of the  latter I saw only the huge white moustache, like a  flying gull, as Raffles had described it; for at a  glance I divined  that this was his arch-enemy, the Count Corbucci himself.
    I did not stop to consider the subtleties of the system by which the  real hunter lagged behind while his subordinate pointed the quarry like  a sporting dog.
  I left the Count shuffling onward faster than before,  and I jumped into some clothes as though the flats were on fire.
  If  the Count was going to follow Raffles in his turn, then I would follow  the Count in mine, and there would be a midnight procession of us  through the town.
  But I found no sign of him in the empty street, and  no sign in the Earl's Court Road, that looked as empty for all its  length, save for a natural enemy standing like a waxwork figure with a  glimmer at his belt.
    "Officer," I gasped, "have you seen anything of an old gentleman with a  big white mustache?"    The unlicked cub of a common constable seemed to eye me the more  suspiciously for the flattering form of my address.
    "Took a hansom," said he at length.
    A hansom!  Then he was not following the others on foot; there was no  guessing his game.
  But something must be said or done.
    "He's a friend of mine," I explained, "and I want to overtake him.
  Did  you hear where he told the fellow to drive?"    A curt negative was the policeman's reply to that; and if ever I take  part in a night assault-at-arms, revolver versus baton, in the back  kitchen, I know which member of the Metropolitan Police Force I should  like for my opponent.
    If there was no overtaking the Count, however, it should be a  comparatively simple matter in the case of the couple on foot, and I  wildly hailed the first hansom that crawled into my ken.
 I must tell  Raffles who it was that I had seen; the Earl's Court Road was long, and  the time since he vanished in it but a few short minutes.
  I drove down  the length of that useful thoroughfare, with an  eye apiece on either  pavement, sweeping each as with a brush, but never a Raffles came into  the pan.
 Then I tried the Fulham Road, first to the west, then to the  east, and in the end drove home to the flat as bold as brass.
  I did  not realize my indiscretion until I had paid the man and was on the  stairs.
  Raffles never dreamt of driving all the way back; but I was  hoping now to find him waiting up above.
  He had said an hour.
  I had  remembered it suddenly.
  And now the hour was more than up.
  But the  flat was as empty as I had left it; the very light that had encouraged  me, pale though it was, as I turned the corner in my hansom, was but  the light that I myself had left burning in the desolate passage.
    I can give you no conception of the night that I  spent.
  Most of it I  hung across the sill, throwing  a wide net with my ears, catching every  footstep  afar off, every hansom bell farther still, only to  gather in  some alien whom I seldom even landed in our street.
  Then I would  listen at the door.
    He might come over the roof; and eventually some one did; but now it  was broad daylight, and  I flung the door open in the milkman's face,  which  whitened at the shock as though I had ducked him  in his own  pail.
    "You're late," I thundered as the first excuse for my excitement.
    "Beg your pardon," said he, indignantly, "but I'm half an hour before  my usual time.
"    "Then I beg yours," said I; "but the fact is, Mr. Maturin has had one  of his bad nights, and I seem to have been waiting hours for milk to  make him a cup of tea.
"    This little fib (ready enough for Raffles, though I say it) earned me  not only forgiveness but that obliging sympathy which is a branch of  the business of the man at the door.
  The good fellow said that he  could see I had been sitting up all night, and he left me pluming  myself upon the accidental art with which I had told my very necessary  tarra-diddle.
  On reflection I gave the credit to instinct, not  accident, and then sighed afresh as I realized how the influence of the  master was sinking into  me, and he Heaven knew where!  But my  punishment was swift to follow, for within the hour the bell rang  imperiously twice, and there was Dr.
 Theobald on our mat; in a yellow  Jaeger suit, with a chin as yellow jutting over the flaps that he had  turned up to hide his pyjamas.
    "What's this about a bad night?" said he.
    "He couldn't sleep, and he wouldn't let me," I  whispered, never  loosening my grasp of the door, and standing tight against the other  wall.
  "But he's sleeping like a baby now.
"    "I must see him.
"    "He gave strict orders that you should not.
"    "I'm his medical man, and I--"    "You know what he is," I said, shrugging; "the least thing wakes him,  and you will if you insist on seeing him now.
  It will be the last  time, I  warn you!  I know what he said, and you don't.
"    The doctor cursed me under his fiery moustache.
    "I shall come up during the course of the morning," he snarled.
    "And I shall tie up the bell," I said, "and if it doesn't ring he'll be  sleeping still, but I will not risk waking him by coming to the door  again.
"    And with that I shut it in his face.
  I was improving, as Raffles had  said; but what would it profit me if some evil had befallen him?  And  now I was prepared for the worst.
  A boy came up whistling and leaving  papers on the mats; it  was getting on for eight o'clock, and the  whiskey  and soda of half-past twelve stood untouched and stagnant in  the tumbler.
  If the worst had happened to Raffles, I felt that I would  either never drink again, or else seldom do anything else.
    Meanwhile I could not even break my fast, but roamed the flat in a  misery not to be described, my very linen still unchanged, my cheeks  and chin now tawny from the unwholesome night.
  How long would it go  on?  I wondered for a time.
  Then I changed my tune: how long could I  endure it?    It went on actually until the forenoon only, but my endurance cannot be  measured by the time, for to me every hour of it was an arctic night.
  Yet it cannot have been much after eleven when the ring came at the  bell, which I had forgotten to tie up after all.
  But this was not the  doctor;  neither, too well I knew, was it the wanderer returned.
  Our  bell was the pneumatic one that tells  you if the touch be light or  heavy; the hand upon it now was tentative and shy.
    The owner of the hand I had never seen before.
  He was young and  ragged, with one eye blank,  but the other ablaze with some fell  excitement.
  And straightway he burst into a low torrent of words, of  which all I knew was that they were Italian, and therefore news of  Raffles, if only I had known the language! But dumb-show might help us  somewhat, and in I dragged him, though against his will, a new alarm in  his one wild  eye.
    "Non capite?" he cried when I had him inside and had withstood the  torrent.
    "No, I'm bothered if I do!" I answered, guessing his question from his  tone.
    "Vostro amico," he repeated over and over again; and then, "Poco tempo,  poco tempo, poco tempo!"    For once in my life the classical education of  my public-school days  was of real value.
  "My  pal, my pal, and no time to be lost!" I  translated freely, and flew for my hat.
    "Ecco, signore!" cried the fellow, snatching the watch from my  waistcoat pocket, and putting one  black thumb-nail on the long hand,  the other on  he numeral twelve.
  "Mezzogiorno--poco tempo--poco  tempo!"  And again I seized his meaning,  that it was twenty past  eleven, and we must be there by twelve.
  But where, but where?  It was  maddening to be summoned like this, and not to know  what had happened,  nor to have any means of finding out.
 But my presence of mind stood by  me still, I was improving by seven-league strides, and I crammed my  handkerchief between the drum and hammer of the bell before leaving.
  The doctor could ring now till he was black in the face, but I was not  coming, and he need not think it.
    I half expected to find a hansom waiting, but there was none, and we  had gone some distance down the Earl's Court Road before we got one; in  fact, we had to run to the stand.
  Opposite is the church with the  clock upon it, as everybody knows, and at sight of the dial my  companion had wrung his hands; it was close upon the half-hour.
    "Poco tempo--pochissimo!" he wailed.
  "Bloom-buree Ske-warr," he then  cried to the cabman--"numero trentotto!"    "Bloomsbury Square," I roared on my own account, "I'll show you the  house when we get there, only drive like be-damned!"    My companion lay back gasping in his corner.
  The small glass told me  that my own face was pretty red.
    "A nice show!" I cried; "and not a word can you tell me.
  Didn't you  bring me a note?"    I might have known by this time that he had not, still I went through  the pantomime of writing with my finger on my cuff.
  But he shrugged  and  shook his head.
    "Niente," said he.
  "Una quistione di vita, di vita!"    "What's that?" I snapped, my early training come in again.
  "Say it  slowly--andante--rallentando.
"    Thank Italy for the stage instructions in the songs one used to murder!  The fellow actually understood.
    "Una--quistione--di--vita.
"    "Or mors, eh?" I shouted, and up went the trap-door over our heads.
    "Avanti, avanti, avanti!" cried the Italian, turning up his one-eyed  face.
    "Hell-to-leather," I translated, "and double fare if you do it by  twelve o'clock.
"    But in the streets of London how is one to know the time?  In the  Earl's Court Road it had not  been half-past, and at Barker's in High  Street it was but a minute later.
  A long half-mile a minute, that was  going like the wind, and indeed we had done much of it at a gallop.
  But the next hundred yards took us five minutes by the next clock, and  which was one to believe?  I fell back upon my own old watch (it was my  own), which made it eighteen minutes to the hour as we swung across the  Serpentine bridge, and by the quarter we were in the Bayswater  Road--not up for once.
    "Presto, presto," my pale guide murmured.
  "Affretatevi--avanti!"    "Ten bob if you do it," I cried through the trap, without the slightest  notion of what we were to do.
  But it was "una quistione di vita," and  "vostro amico" must and could only be my miserable Raffles.
    What a very godsend is the perfect hansom to the man or woman in a  hurry!  It had been our great good fortune to jump into a perfect  hansom; there was no choice, we had to take the first upon the rank,  but it must have deserved its place with the rest nowhere.
  New tires,  superb springs, a horse in a thousand, and a driver up to every trick  of his trade!  In and out we went like a fast half-back at the Rugby  game, yet where the traffic was thinnest, there were we.
  And how he  knew his way!  At the Marble Arch he slipped out of the main stream,  and so into Wigmore Street, then up and in and out and on until I saw  the gold tips of the Museum palisade gleaming between the horse's ears  in the sun.
  Plop, plop, plop; ting, ling, ling; bell and horse-shoes,  horse-shoes and bell, until the colossal figure of C.
 J.
 Fox in a grimy  toga spelt Bloomsbury Square with my watch still wanting three minutes  to the hour.
    "What number?" cried the good fellow over-head.
    "Trentotto, trentotto," said my guide, but he was looking to the right,  and I bundled him out to show the house on foot.
  I had not  half-a-sovereign after all, but I flung our dear driver a whole one  instead, and only wish that it had been a hundred.
    Already the Italian had his latch-key in the door of 38, and in another  moment we were rushing up the narrow stairs of as dingy a London house  as prejudiced countryman can conceive.
  It was panelled, but it was  dark and evil-smelling, and how we should have found our way even to  the stairs but for an unwholesome jet of yellow gas in the hall, I  cannot myself imagine.
  However, up we went pell-mell, to the  right-about on the half-landing, and so like a whirlwind into the  drawing-room a few steps higher.
  There the gas was also burning behind  closed shutters, and the scene is photographed upon my brain, though I  cannot have looked upon it for a whole instant as I sprang in at my  leader's heels.
    This room also was panelled, and in the middle of the wall on our left,  his hands lashed to a ring-bolt high above his head, his toes barely  touching the floor, his neck pinioned by a strap passing through  smaller ring-bolts under either ear, and every inch of him secured on  the same principle, stood, or rather hung, all that was left of  Raffles, for at the first glance I believed him dead.
  A black ruler  gagged him, the ends lashed behind his neck, the blood upon it caked to  bronze in the gaslight.
  And in front of him, ticking like a  sledge-hammer, its only hand upon the stroke of twelve, stood a  simple, old-fashioned, grandfather's clock--but not for half an instant  longer--only until my guide could hurl himself upon it and send the  whole thing crashing into the corner.
  An ear-splitting report  accompanied the crash, a white cloud lifted from the fallen clock, and  I saw a revolver smoking in a vice screwed below the dial, an  arrangement of wires sprouting from the dial itself, and the single  hand at once at its zenith and in contact with these.
    "Tumble to it, Bunny?"    He was alive; these were his first words; the Italian had the  blood-caked ruler in his hand, and with his knife was reaching up to  cut the thongs that lashed the hands.
  He was not tall enough, I seized  him and lifted him up, then fell to work with my own knife upon the  straps.
  And Raffles smiled faintly upon us through his blood-stains.
    "I want you to tumble to it," he whispered; "the neatest thing in  revenge I ever knew, and another minute would have fixed it.
 I've been  waiting for it twelve hours, watching the clock round, death at the end  of the lap!  Electric connection.
  Simple enough.
  Hour-hand only--O  Lord!"    We had cut the last strap.
  He could not stand.
  We supported him  between us to a horsehair sofa,  for the room was furnished, and I  begged him not to speak, while his one-eyed deliverer was at the  door  before Raffles recalled him with a sharp word in Italian.
    "He wants to get me a drink, but that can wait,"  said he, in firmer  voice; "I shall enjoy it the more when I've told you what happened.
  Don't let him  go, Bunny; put your back against the door.
  He's  a  decent soul, and it's lucky for me I got a word with him before they  trussed me up.
  I've promised to set him up in life, and I will, but I  don't want him out of my sight for the moment.
"    "If you squared him last night," I exclaimed, "why the blazes didn't he  come to me till the eleventh hour?"    "Ah, I knew he'd have to cut it fine though I  hoped not quite so fine  as all that.
  But all's well that ends well, and I declare I don't feel  so much the worse.
  I shall be sore about the gills for a bit--and what  do you think?"    He pointed to the long black ruler with the bronze stain; it lay upon  the floor; he held out his hand for it, and I gave it to him.
      "The same one I gagged him with," said Raffles, with his still ghastly  smile; "he was a bit of an artist, old Corbucci, after all!"    "Now let's hear how you fell into his clutches," said I, briskly, for I  was as anxious to hear as he seemed to tell me, only for my part I  could have  waited until we were safe in the flat.
    "I do want to get it off my chest, Bunny," old Raffles admitted, "and  yet I hardly can tell you after all.
  I followed your friend with the  velvet eyes.
  I followed him all the way here.
 Of course I came up to  have a good look at the house when he'd let himself in, and damme if he  hadn't left the door ajar!  Who could resist that?  I had  pushed it  half open and had just one foot on the mat when I got such a crack on  the head as I hope never to get again.
  When I came to my wits they  were hauling me up to that ring-bolt by the hands, and old Corbucci  himself was bowing to me, but how HE got here I don't know yet.
"    "I can tell you that," said I, and told how I had seen the Count for  myself on the pavement underneath our windows.
  "Moreover," I  continued, "I saw him spot you, and five minutes after in Earl's Court  Road I was told he'd driven off in a cab.
  He would see you following  his man, drive home ahead, and catch you by having the door left open  in the way you describe.
"    "Well," said Raffles, "he deserved to catch me somehow, for he'd come  from Naples on purpose, ruler and all, and the ring-bolts were ready  fixed, and even this house taken furnished for nothing else!  He meant  catching me before he'd done, and scoring me off in exactly the same  way that I scored off him, only going one better of course.
  He told me  so himself, sitting where I am sitting now, at three o'clock this  morning, and smoking a most abominable cigar that I've smelt ever  since.
  It appears he sat twenty-four hours when I left HIM trussed up,  but he said twelve would content him in my case, as there was certain  death at the end of them, and I mightn't have life enough left to  appreciate my end if he made it longer.
  But I wouldn't have trusted  him if he could have got the clock to go twice round without firing off  the  pistol.
  He explained the whole mechanism of that to me; he had  thought it all out on the vineyard I told you about; and then he asked  if I remembered what he had promised me in the name of the  Camorra.
  I  only remembered some vague threats,  but he was good enough to give me  so many particulars of that institution that I could make a European  reputation by exposing the whole show if it wasn't for my unfortunate  resemblance to that infernal rascal Raffles.
  Do you think they would  know me at the Yard, Bunny, after all this time?  Upon my soul I've a  good mind to risk it!"    I offered no opinion on the point.
  How could it interest me then?  But  interested I was in Raffles, never more so in my life.
  He had been  tortured all night and half a day, yet he could sit and talk like this  the moment we cut him down; he had been within a minute of his death,  yet he was as full of life as ever; ill-treated and defeated at the  best, he could still smile through his blood as though the boot were on  the other leg.
  I had imagined that I knew my Raffles at last.
  I was  not likely so to flatter myself again.
    "But what has happened to these villains?" I burst out, and my  indignation was not only against them for their cruelty, but also  against their victim  for his phlegmatic attitude toward them.
  It was  difficult to believe that this was Raffles.
    "Oh," said he, "they were to go off to Italy INSTANTER; they should be  crossing now.
  But do listen to what I am telling you; it's  interesting, my dear man.
  This old sinner Corbucci turns out to have  been no end of a boss in the Camorra--says so himself.
  One of the capi  paranze, my  boy, no less; and the velvety Johnny a giovano onorato,  Anglice, fresher.
  This fellow here was also in it, and I've sworn to  protect him from them evermore; and it's just as I said, half the  organ-grinders in London belong, and the whole lot of them were put on  my tracks by secret instructions.
  This excellent youth manufactures  iced poison on Saffron Hill when he's at home.
"    "And why on earth didn't he come to me quicker?"    "Because he couldn't talk to you, he could only fetch you, and it was  as much as his life was worth  to do that before our friends had  departed.
  They were going by the eleven o'clock from Victoria, and  that didn't leave much chance, but he certainly  oughtn't to have run  it as fine as he did.
  Still you must remember that I had to fix things  up with him in the fewest possible words, in a single minute that the  other two were indiscreet enough to leave us alone together.
"    The ragamuffin in question was watching us with all his solitary eye,  as though he knew that we were discussing him.
  Suddenly he broke out  in agonized accents, his hands clasped, and a face so full of fear that  every moment I expected to see him on his knees.
  But Raffles answered  kindly, reassuringly, I could tell from his tone, and then turned to me  with a compassionate shrug.
    "He says he couldn't find the mansions, Bunny, and really it's not to  be wondered at.
  I had only time to tell him to hunt you up and bring  you here by hook or crook before twelve to-day, and after all he has  done that.
  But now the poor devil thinks you're riled with him, and  that we'll give him away to the Camorra.
"    "Oh, it's not with him I'm riled," I said frankly, "but with those  other blackguards, and--and with you, old chap, for taking it all  as  you do, while such infamous scoundrels have the last laugh, and are  safely on their way to France!"    Raffles looked up at me with a curiously open eye, an eye that I never  saw when he was not in earnest.
  I fancied he did not like my last  expression but one.
  After all, it was no laughing matter to him.
    "But are they?" said he.
  "I'm not so sure.
"    "You said they were!"    "I said they should be.
"    "Didn't you hear them go?"    "I heard nothing but the clock all night.
  It was like Big Ben striking  at the last--striking nine to the fellow on the drop.
"    And in that open eye I saw at last a deep glimmer of the ordeal through  which he had passed.
    "But, my dear old Raffles, if they're still on the premises--"    The thought was too thrilling for a finished sentence.
    "I hope they are," he said grimly, going to the door.
  "There's a gas  on!  Was that burning when you came in?"    Now that I thought of it, yes, it had been.
    "And there's a frightfully foul smell," I added, as I followed Raffles  down the stairs.
  He turned to me gravely with his hand upon the  front-room door, and at the same moment I saw a coat with an astrakhan  collar hanging on the pegs.
    "They are in here, Bunny," he said, and turned the handle.
    The door would only open a few inches.
  But a detestable odor came out,  with a broad bar of yellow gaslight.
  Raffles put his handkerchief to  his nose.
  I followed his example, signing to our ally to do the same,  and in another minute we had all three squeezed into the room.
    The man with the yellow boots was lying against the door, the Count's  great carcass sprawled upon the table, and at a glance it was evident  that both men had been dead some hours.
  The old Camorrist had the stem  of a liqueur-glass between his swollen blue fingers, one of which had  been cut in the breakage, and the livid flesh was also brown with the  last blood that it would ever shed.
  His face was on the table, the  huge moustache projecting from under either leaden cheek, yet looking  itself strangely alive.
  Broken bread and scraps of frozen macaroni lay  upon the cloth and at the bottom of two soup-plates and a tureen; the  macaroni had a tinge of tomato; and there was a crimson dram left in  the tumblers, with an empty fiasco to show whence it came.
  But near  the great gray head upon the table another liqueur-glass stood,  unbroken, and still full of some white and stinking liquid; and near  that a tiny silver flask, which made me recoil from Raffles as I had  not from the dead; for I knew it to be his.
    "Come out of this poisonous air," he said sternly, "and I will tell you  how it has happened.
"    So we all three gathered together in the hall.
  But it was Raffles who  stood nearest the street-door, his back to it, his eyes upon us two.
  And  though it was to me only that he spoke at first, he would pause  from point to point, and translate into Italian for the benefit of the  one-eyed alien to whom he owed his life.
    "You probably don't even know the name, Bunny," he began, "of the  deadliest poison yet known to science.
  It is cyanide of cacodyl, and I  have carried that small flask of it about with me for months.
  Where I  got it matters nothing; the  whole point is that a mere sniff reduces  flesh to clay.
  I  have never had any opinion of suicide, as you  know,  but I always felt it worth while to be forearmed against the very  worst.
  Well, a bottle of  this stuff is calculated to stiffen an  ordinary roomful of ordinary people within five minutes;  and I  remembered my flask when they had me as good as crucified in the small  hours of this morning.
  I asked them to take it out of my pocket.
  I  begged them to give me a drink before they left  me.
  And what do you  suppose they did?"    I thought of many things but suggested none, while Raffles turned this  much of his statement into sufficiently fluent Italian.
  But when he  faced  me again his face was still flaming.
    "That beast Corbucci!" said he--"how can I pity him?  He took the  flask; he would give me none; he flicked me in the face instead.
 My  idea  was that he, at least, should go with me--to sell my life as  dearly as that--and a sniff would have settled us both.
 But no, he must  tantalize and torment me; he thought it brandy; he must take it  downstairs to drink to my destruction!  Can  you have any pity for a  hound like that?"    "Let us go," I at last said, hoarsely, as Raffles finished speaking in  Italian, and his second listener stood open-mouthed.
    "We will go," said Raffles, "and we will chance being seen; if the  worst comes to the worst this good chap will prove that I have been  tied up since one o'clock this morning, and the medical evidence will  decide how long those dogs have been dead.
"    But the worst did not come to the worst, more power to my unforgotten  friend the cabman, who never came forward to say what manner of men he  had driven to Bloomsbury Square at top speed on the very day upon which  the tragedy was discovered there, or whence he had driven them.
  To be  sure, they had not behaved like murderers, whereas the evidence at the  inquest all went to show that the defunct Corbucci was little better.
  His reputation, which transpired with his identity, was that of a  libertine and a renegade, while the infernal apparatus upstairs  revealed the fiendish arts of the anarchist to boot.
  The inquiry  resulted  eventually in an open verdict, and was chiefly instrumental  in killing such compassion as is usually felt for the dead who die in  their sins.
    But Raffles would not have passed this title for this tale.
        TO CATCH A THIEF    I    Society persons are not likely to have forgotten the series of  audacious robberies by which so many of themselves suffered in turn  during the brief course of a recent season.
  Raid after raid was made  upon the smartest houses in town, and within a few weeks more than one  exalted head had been shorn of its priceless tiara.
  The Duke and  Duchess of Dorchester lost half the portable pieces of their historic  plate on the very night of their Graces' almost equally historic  costume ball.
  The Kenworthy diamonds were taken in broad daylight,  during the excitement of a charitable meeting on the ground floor, and  the gifts of her belted bridegroom to Lady May Paulton while the outer  air was thick with a prismatic shower of confetti.
  It was obvious that  all this was the work of no ordinary thief, and perhaps inevitable that  the name of Raffles should have been dragged from oblivion by callous  disrespecters of the departed and unreasoning apologists for the  police.
  These wiseacres did not hesitate to bring a dead man back to  life because they knew of no living one capable of such feats; it is  their heedless and inconsequent calumnies that the present paper is  partly intended to refute.
  As a matter of fact, our joint innocence in  this matter was only exceeded by our common envy, and for a long time,  like the rest of the world, neither of us had the slightest clew to the  identity of the person who was following in our steps with such  irritating results.
    "I should mind less," said Raffles, "if the fellow were really playing  my game.
  But abuse of hospitality was never one of my strokes, and it  seems to me the only shot he's got.
  When we took old Lady Melrose's  necklace, Bunny, we were not staying with the Melroses, if you  recollect.
"    We were discussing the robberies for the hundredth time, but for once  under conditions more favorable to animated conversation than our  unique circumstances permitted in the flat.
  We did not often dine out.
  Dr.
 Theobald was one impediment, the risk of recognition was another.
  But there were exceptions, when the doctor was away or the patient  defiant, and on these rare occasions we frequented a certain  unpretentious restaurant in the Fulham quarter, where the cooking was  plain but excellent, and the cellar a surprise.
  Our bottle of '89  champagne was empty to the label when the subject arose, to be touched  by Raffles in the reminiscent manner indicated above.
  I can see his  clear eye upon me now, reading me, weighing me.
  But I was not so  sensitive to his scrutiny at the time.
  His tone was deliberate,  calculating, preparatory; not as I heard it then, through a head full  of wine, but as it floats back to me across the gulf between that  moment and this.
    "Excellent fillet!" said I, grossly.
  "So you think this chap is as  much in society as we were, do you?"    I preferred not to think so myself.
  We had cause enough for jealousy  without that.
  But Raffles raised his eyebrows an eloquent half-inch.
    "As much, my dear Bunny?  He is not only in it, but of it; there's no  comparison between us there.
  Society is in rings like a target, and we  never were in the bull's-eye, however thick you may lay on the ink!  I  was asked for my cricket.
  I haven't forgotten it yet.
  But this  fellow's one of themselves,  with the right of entre into the houses  which we could only 'enter' in a professional sense.
  That's obvious  unless all these little exploits are the work of different hands, which  they as obviously are not.
  And it's why I'd give five hundred pounds  to put salt on him to-night!"    "Not you," said I, as I drained my glass in festive incredulity.
    "But I would, my dear Bunny.
  Waiter! another half-bottle of this," and  Raffles leant across the table as the empty one was taken away.
  "I  never was more serious in my life," he continued below his breath.
  "Whatever else our successor may be, he's not a dead man like me, or a  marked man like you.
  If there's any truth in my theory he's one of the  last people upon whom suspicion is ever likely to rest; and oh, Bunny,  what a partner he would make for you and me!"    Under less genial influences the very idea of a third partner would  have filled my soul with offence; but Raffles had chosen his moment  unerringly, and his arguments lost nothing by the flowing accompaniment  of the extra pint.
  They were, however, quite strong in themselves.
  The gist of them was that thus far we had remarkably little to show for  what Raffles would call "our second innings.
"  This even I could not  deny.
  We had scored a few "long singles," but our "best shots"  had  gone "straight to hand," and we were "playing a deuced slow game.
"  Therefore we needed a new partner--and the metaphor failed Raffles.
    It had served its turn.
  I already agreed with him.
  In truth I was  tired of my false position as hireling attendant, and had long fancied  myself an object of suspicion to that other impostor the doctor.
  A  fresh, untrammelled start was a fascinating idea to me, though two was  company, and three in our case might be worse than none.
  But I did not  see how we could hope, with our respective handicaps, to solve a  problem which was already the despair of Scotland Yard.
    "Suppose I have solved it," observed Raffles, cracking a walnut in his  palm.
    "How could you?" I asked, without believing for an instant that he had.
    "I have been taking the Morning Post for some time now.
"    "Well?"    "You have got me a good many odd numbers of the less base society  papers.
"    "I can't for the life of me see what you're driving at.
"    Raffles smiled indulgently as he cracked another nut.
    "That's because you've neither observation nor imagination, Bunny--and  yet you try to write!  Well, you wouldn't think it, but I have a fairly  complete list of the people who were at the various functions under  cover of which these different little coups were brought off.
"    I said very stolidly that I did not see how that could help him.
 It was  the only answer to his  good-humored but self-satisfied contempt; it  happened also to be true.
    "Think," said Raffles, in a patient voice.
    "When thieves break in and steal," said I, "upstairs, I don't see much  point in discovering who was downstairs at the time.
"    "Quite," said Raffles--"when they do break in.
"    "But that's what they have done in all these cases.
  An upstairs door  found screwed up, when things were at their height below; thief gone  and jewels with him before alarm could be raised.
 Why, the trick's so  old that I never knew you condescend to play it.
"    "Not so old as it looks," said Raffles, choosing the cigars and handing  me mine.
  "Cognac or Benedictine, Bunny?"    "Brandy," I said, coarsely.
    "Besides," he went on, "the rooms were not screwed up; at Dorchester  House, at any rate, the door was only locked, and the key missing, so  that it might have been done on either side.
"    "But that was where he left his rope-ladder behind him!" I exclaimed in  triumph; but Raffles only shook his head.
    "I don't believe in that rope-ladder, Bunny, except as a blind.
"    "Then what on earth do you believe?"    "That every one of these so-called burglaries has been done from the  inside, by one of the guests; and what's more I'm very much mistaken if  I haven't spotted the right sportsman.
"    I began to believe that he really had, there was such a wicked gravity  in the eyes that twinkled faintly into mine.
  I raised my glass in  convivial congratulation, and still remember the somewhat anxious eye  with which Raffles saw it emptied.
    "I can only find one likely name," he continued, "that figures in all  these lists, and it is anything  but a likely one at first sight.
  Lord  Ernest Belville was at all those functions.
  Know anything about him,  Bunny?"    "Not the Rational Drink fanatic?"    "Yes.
"    "That's all I want to know.
"    "Quite," said Raffles; "and yet what could be more promising?  A man  whose views are so broad and moderate, and so widely held already  (saving your presence, Bunny), does not bore the world with them  without ulterior motives.
  So far so good.
  What are this chap's  motives?  Does he want to advertise himself?  No, he's somebody  already.
  But is he rich?  On the contrary, he's as poor as a rat for  his position, and apparently without the least ambition to be anything  else;  certainly he won't enrich himself by making a public fad of what  all sensible people are agreed upon as it is.
  Then suddenly one gets  one's own old idea--the alternative profession!  My cricket--his  Rational Drink!  But it is no use jumping to conclusions.
  I must know  more than the newspapers can tell me.
  Our aristocratic friend is  forty, and unmarried.
  What has he been doing all these years?  How the  devil was I to find out?"    "How did you?" I asked, declining to spoil my digestion with a  conundrum, as it was his evident intention that I should.
    "Interviewed him!" said Raffles, smiling slowly on my amazement.
    "You--interviewed him?" I echoed.
  "When--and where?"    "Last Thursday night, when, if you remember, we kept early hours,  because I felt done.
  What  was the use of telling you what I had up my  sleeve, Bunny?  It might have ended in fizzle, as it still may.
  But  Lord Ernest Belville was addressing  the meeting at Exeter Hall; I  waited for him when the show was over, dogged him home to King John's  Mansions, and interviewed him in his own rooms there before he turned  in.
"    My journalistic jealousy was piqued to the quick.
  Affecting a  scepticism I did not feel (for  no outrage was beyond the pale of his  impudence), I inquired dryly which journal Raffles had pretended to  represent.
  It is unnecessary to report his answer.
 I could not believe  him without further explanation.
    "I should have thought," he said, "that even you would have spotted a  practice I never omit upon certain occasions.
  I always pay a visit to  the drawing-room, and fill my waistcoat pocket from the card-tray.
  It  is an immense help in any little temporary impersonation.
  On Thursday  night I sent up the card of a powerful writer connected with a powerful  paper; if Lord Ernest had known him in the flesh I should have been  obliged to confess to a journalistic ruse; luckily he didn't--and I had  been sent by my editor to get the interview for next morning.
  What  could be better--for the alternative profession?"    I inquired what the interview had brought forth.
    "Everything," said Raffles.
  "Lord Ernest has been a wanderer these  twenty years.
  Texas, Fiji, Australia.
  I suspect him of wives and  families in all three.
  But his manners are a liberal education.
  He  gave me some beautiful whiskey, and forgot all about his fad.
  He is  strong and subtle, but I talked him off his guard.
  He is going to the  Kirkleathams' to-night--I saw the card stuck up.
  I stuck some wax into  his keyhole as he was switching off the lights.
"    And, with an eye upon the waiters, Raffles showed me a skeleton key,  newly twisted and filed;  but my share of the extra pint (I am afraid  no fair share) had made me dense.
  I looked from the key to Raffles  with puckered forehead--for I happened to catch sight of it in the  mirror behind him.
    "The Dowager Lady Kirkleatham," he whispered, "has diamonds as big as  beans, and likes to have 'em all on--and goes to bed early--and happens  to be in town!"    And now I saw.
    "The villain means to get them from her!"    "And I mean to get them from the villain," said Raffles; "or, rather,  your share and mine.
"    "Will he consent to a partnership?"    "We shall have him at our mercy.
  He daren't refuse.
"    Raffles's plan was to gain access to Lord Ernest's rooms before  midnight; there we were to lie in wait for the aristocratic rascal, and  if I left all details to Raffles, and simply stood by in case of a  rumpus, I should be playing my part and earning my share.
  It was a  part that I had played before, not always with a good grace, though  there had never been any question about the share.
  But to-night I was  nothing loath.
  I had had just champagne enough--how Raffles knew my  measure!--and I was ready and eager for anything.
  Indeed, I did not  wish to wait for the coffee, which was  to be especially strong by  order of Raffles.
 But on that he insisted, and it was between ten and  eleven when at last we were in our cab.
    "It would be fatal to be too early," he said as we drove; "on the other  hand, it would be dangerous to leave it too late.
  One must risk  something.
  How I should love to drive down Piccadilly and see the  lights!  But unnecessary risks are another story.
"      II    King John's Mansions, as everybody knows, are the oldest, the ugliest,  and the tallest block  of flats in all London.
  But they are built  upon a more generous scale than has since become the rule, and with a  less studious regard  for the economy of space.
 We were about to  drive  into the spacious courtyard when the gate-keeper checked us in order to  let another hansom  drive out.
    It contained a middle-aged man of the military type, like ourselves in  evening dress.
  That much I saw as his hansom crossed our bows,  because I could not help seeing it, but I should  not have given the  incident a second thought if it had not been for his extraordinary  effect upon Raffles.
  In an instant he was out upon the curb, paying  the cabby, and in another he was leading me across the street, away  from the mansions.
    "Where on earth are you going?" I naturally exclaimed.
    "Into the park," said he.
  "We are too early.
"    His voice told me more than his words.
  It was strangely stern.
    "Was that him--in the hansom?"    "It was.
"    "Well, then, the coast's clear," said I, comfortably.
  I was for  turning back then and there, but Raffles forced me on with a hand that  hardened  on my arm.
    "It was a nearer thing than I care about," said he.
  "This seat will  do; no, the next one's further from a lamp-post.
  We will give him a  good half-hour, and I don't want to talk.
"    We had been seated some minutes when Big Ben sent a languid chime over  our heads to the stars.
  It was half-past ten, and a sultry night.
  Eleven had struck before Raffles awoke from his sullen reverie, and  recalled me from mine with a slap on the back.
  In a couple of minutes  we were in the lighted vestibule at the inner end of the courtyard of  King John's Mansions.
    "Just left Lord Ernest at Lady Kirkleatham's," said Raffles.
 "Gave me  his key and asked us to wait for him in his rooms.
  Will you send us up  in the lift?"    In a small way, I never knew old Raffles do anything better.
 There was  not an instant's demur.
  Lord Ernest Belville's rooms were at the top  of the building, but we were in them as quickly as lift could carry and  page-boy conduct us.
  And there was no need for the skeleton key after  all; the boy opened the outer door with one of his own, and switched on  the lights before leaving us.
    "Now that's interesting," said Raffles, as soon as we were alone; "they  can come in and clean when he is out.
  What if he keeps his swag at the  bank?  By Jove, that's an idea for him!  I don't believe he's getting  rid of it; it's all lying low somewhere, if I'm not mistaken, and he's  not a fool.
"    While he spoke he was moving about the sitting-room, which was  charmingly furnished in the antique style, and making as many remarks  as  though he were an auctioneer's clerk with an inventory to prepare  and a day to do it in, instead  of a cracksman who might be surprised  in his crib at any moment.
    "Chippendale of sorts, eh, Bunny?  Not genuine, of course; but where  can you get genuine Chippendale now, and who knows it when they  see  it?  There's no merit in mere antiquity.
  Yet the way people pose on  the subject!  If a thing's handsome and useful, and good  cabinet-making, it's good enough for me.
"    "Hadn't we better explore the whole place?"  I suggested nervously.
  He  had not even bolted the outer door.
  Nor would he when I called his  attention to the omission.
    "If Lord Ernest finds his rooms locked up he'll raise Cain," said  Raffles; "we must let him come in and lock up for himself before we  corner him.
  But he won't come yet; if he did it might be awkward, for  they'd tell him down below what I told them.
  A new staff comes on at  midnight.
  I discovered that the other night.
"    "Supposing he does come in before?"    "Well, he can't have us turned out without first seeing who we are, and  he won't try it on when I've had one word with him.
 Unless my  suspicions are unfounded, I mean.
"    "Isn't it about time to test them?"    "My good Bunny, what do you suppose I've been doing all this while?  He  keeps nothing in  here.
  There isn't a lock to the Chippendale that you  couldn't pick with a penknife, and not a loose board in the floor, for  I was treading for one before the boy left us.
  Chimney's no use in a  place like this where they keep them swept for you.
  Yes, I'm quite  ready to try his bedroom.
"    There was but a bathroom besides; no kitchen, no servant's room;  neither are necessary in King John's Mansions.
  I thought it as well to  put my  head inside the bathroom while Raffles went into the bedroom,  for I was tormented by the horrible idea that the man might all this  time be concealed somewhere in the flat.
  But the bathroom blazed void  in the electric light.
  I found Raffles hanging out of the starry  square which was the bedroom window, for the room was still in  darkness.
  I felt for the switch at the door.
    "Put it out again!" said Raffles fiercely.
  He rose from the sill, drew  blind and curtains carefully, then switched on the light himself.
  It  fell  upon a face creased more in pity than in anger, and Raffles only  shook his head as I hung mine.
    "It's all right, old boy," said he; "but corridors have windows too,  and servants have eyes; and you and I are supposed to be in the other  room, not in this.
  But cheer up, Bunny!  This is THE room; look at the  extra bolt on the door; he's had that put on, and there's an iron  ladder to his window in case of fire!  Way of escape ready against the  hour of need; he's a better man than I thought him, Bunny, after all.
  But you may bet your bottom dollar that if there's any boodle in the  flat it's in this room.
"    Yet the room was very lightly furnished; and nothing was locked.
 We  looked everywhere, but we looked in vain.
  The wardrobe was filled with  hanging coats and trousers in a press, the drawers with the softest  silk and finest linen.
  It was a  camp bedstead that would not have  unsettled an anchorite; there was no place for treasure there.
  I  looked up the chimney, but Raffles told me not to be a fool, and asked  if I ever listened to what he said.
 There was no question about his  temper now.
  I never knew him in a worse.
    "Then he has got it in the bank," he growled.
  "I'll swear I'm not  mistaken in my man!"    I had the tact not to differ with him there.
  But I could not help  suggesting that now was our time to remedy any mistake we might have  made.
  We were on the right side of midnight still.
    "Then we stultify ourselves downstairs," said Raffles.
  "No, I'll be  shot if I do!  He may come in with the Kirkleatham diamonds! You do  what you like, Bunny, but I don't budge.
"    "I certainly shan't leave you," I retorted, "to be knocked into the  middle of next week by a better man than yourself.
"    I had borrowed his own tone, and he did not like it.
  They never do.
  I  thought for a moment that Raffles was going to strike me--for the first  and last time in his life.
  He could if he liked.
  My blood was up.
  I  was ready to send him to the devil.
 And I emphasized my offence by  nodding and shrugging toward a pair of very large Indian clubs that  stood in the fender, on either side of the chimney up which I had  presumed to glance.
    In an instant Raffles had seized the clubs, and  was whirling them  about his gray head in a mixture of childish pique and puerile bravado  which I should have thought him altogether above.
    And  suddenly as I watched him his face changed, softened, lit up, and  he swung the clubs gently down upon the bed.
    "They're not heavy enough for their size," said he rapidly; "and I'll  take my oath they're not the same weight!"    He shook one club after the other, with both hands, close to his ear;  then he examined their butt-ends under the electric light.
 I saw what  he  suspected now, and caught the contagion of his suppressed  excitement.
  Neither of us spoke.
  But Raffles had taken out the  portable tool-box that he called a knife, and always carried, and as he  opened the gimlet he handed me the club he held.
  Instinctively I  tucked the small end under my arm, and presented the other to Raffles.
    "Hold him tight," he whispered, smiling.
  "He's not only a better man  than I thought him, Bunny; he's hit upon a better dodge than ever I  did, of its kind.
  Only I should have weighted them evenly--to a hair.
"    He had screwed the gimlet into the circular butt, close to the edge,  and now we were wrenching in opposite directions.
  For a moment or more  nothing happened.
  Then all at once something gave, and Raffles swore  an oath as soft as any prayer.
  And for the minute after that his hand  went round and round with the gimlet, as though he were grinding a  piano-organ, while the end wormed slowly out on its delicate thread of  fine hard wood.
    The clubs were as hollow as drinking-horns, the pair of them, for we  went from one to the other without pausing to undo the padded packets  that poured out upon the bed.
  These were deliciously heavy to the  hand, yet thickly swathed in cotton-wool, so that some stuck together,  retaining the shape of the cavity, as though they had been run out of a  mould.
  And when we did open them--but let Raffles speak.
    He had deputed me to screw in the ends of the clubs, and to replace the  latter in the fender where we had found them.
  When I had done the  counterpane was glittering with diamonds where it was not shimmering  with pearls.
    "If this isn't that tiara that Lady May was married in," said Raffles,  "and that disappeared out of the room she changed in, while it rained  confetti on the steps, I'll present it to her instead of the one she  lost.
.
.
.
  It was stupid to keep these old gold spoons, valuable as they  are;  they made the difference in the weight.
.
.
.
  Here we have probably  the Kenworthy diamonds.
.
.
.
  I don't know the history of these  pearls.
.
.
.
 This looks like one family of rings--left on the  basin-stand, perhaps--alas, poor lady!  And that's the lot.
"    Our eyes met across the bed.
    "What's it all worth?" I asked, hoarsely.
    "Impossible to say.
  But more than all we ever took in all our lives.
  That I'll swear to.
"    "More than all--"    My tongue swelled with the thought.
    "But it'll take some turning into cash, old chap!"    "And--must it be a partnership?" I asked, finding a lugubrious voice at  length.
    "Partnership be damned!" cried Raffles, heartily.
  "Let's get out  quicker than we came in.
"    We pocketed the things between us, cotton-wool and all, not because we  wanted the latter, but to remove all immediate traces of our really  meritorious deed.
    "The sinner won't dare to say a word when he does find out," remarked  Raffles of Lord Ernest; "but that's no reason why he should find out  before he must.
  Everything's straight in here, I think; no, better  leave the window open as it was, and the blind up.
  Now out with the  light.
  One peep at the other room.
  That's all right, too.
  Out with  the passage light, Bunny, while I open--"    His words died away in a whisper.
  A key was fumbling at the lock  outside.
    "Out with it--out with it!" whispered Raffles in an agony; and as I  obeyed he picked me off my feet and swung me bodily but silently into  the bedroom, just as the outer door opened, and a masterful step strode  in.
    The next five were horrible minutes.
  We heard the apostle of Rational  Drink unlock one of the deep drawers in his antique sideboard, and  sounds followed suspiciously like the splash of spirits and the steady  stream from a siphon.
  Never before or since did I experience such a  thirst as assailed me at that moment, nor do I believe that many  tropical explorers have known its equal.
  But I  had Raffles with me,  and his hand was as steady and as cool as the hand of a trained nurse.
  That I know because he turned up the collar of my overcoat for me, for  some reason, and buttoned it at the throat.
  I afterwards found that he  had done the same to his own, but I did not hear him doing it.
  The one  thing I heard in the bedroom was a tiny metallic click, muffled and  deadened in his overcoat pocket, and it not only removed my last  tremor, but strung me to a higher pitch of excitement than ever.
  Yet I  had then no conception of the game that Raffles was deciding to play,  and that I was to play with him in another minute.
    It cannot have been longer before Lord Ernest came into his bedroom.
  Heavens, but my heart had not forgotten how to thump! We were standing  near the door, and I could swear he touched me; then his boots creaked,  there was a rattle in the fender--and Raffles switched on the light.
    Lord Ernest Belville crouched in its glare with one Indian club held by  the end, like a footman with a stolen bottle.
  A good-looking,  well-built, iron-gray, iron-jawed man; but a fool and a weakling at  that moment, if he had never been either before.
    "Lord Ernest Belville," said Raffles, "it's no use.
  This is a loaded  revolver, and if you force me I shall use it on you as I would on any  other desperate criminal.
  I am here to arrest you for a series of  robberies at the Duke of Dorchester's,  Sir John Kenworthy's, and other  noblemen's and gentlemen's houses during the present season.
  You'd  better drop what you've got in your hand.
  It's empty.
"    Lord Ernest lifted the club an inch or two, and  with it his  eyebrows--and after it his stalwart frame as the club crashed back into  the fender.
  And as he stood at his full height, a courteous but ironic  smile under the cropped moustache, he looked what he was, criminal or  not.
    "Scotland Yard?" said he.
    "That's our affair, my lord.
"    "I didn't think they'd got it in them," said Lord Ernest.
  "Now I  recognize you.
  You're my interviewer.
  No, I didn't think any of you  fellows had got all that in you.
  Come into the other room, and I'll  show you something else.
  Oh, keep me covered by all means.
  But look  at this!"    On the antique sideboard, their size doubled by reflection in the  polished mahogany, lay a coruscating cluster of precious stones, that  fell in festoons about Lord Ernest's fingers as he handed them to  Raffles with scarcely a shrug.
    "The Kirkleatham diamonds," said he.
  "Better add 'em to the bag.
"    Raffles did so without a smile; with his overcoat buttoned up to the  chin, his tall hat pressed  down to his eyes, and between the two his  incisive features and his keen, stern glance, he looked the ideal  detective of fiction and the stage.
  What  _I_ looked God knows, but I  did my best to glower and show my teeth at his side.
  I had thrown  myself into the game, and it was obviously a winning one.
    "Wouldn't take a share, I suppose?" Lord Ernest said casually.
    Raffles did not condescend to reply.
  I rolled back my lips like a  bull-pup.
    "Then a drink, at least!"    My mouth watered, but Raffles shook his head impatiently.
    "We must be going, my lord, and you will have to come with us.
"    I wondered what in the world we should do with him when we had got him.
    "Give me time to put some things together?  Pair of pyjamas and  tooth-brush, don't you know?"    "I cannot give you many minutes, my lord, but I don't want to cause a  disturbance here, so I'll tell them to call a cab if you like.
  But I  shall be back in a minute, and you must be ready in five.
  Here,  inspector, you'd better keep this while I am gone.
"    And I was left alone with that dangerous criminal!  Raffles nipped my  arm as he handed me the revolver, but I got small comfort out of that.
    "'Sea-green Incorruptible?'" inquired Lord Ernest as we stood face to  face.
    "You don't corrupt me," I replied through naked teeth.
    "Then come into my room.
  I'll lead the way.
  Think you can hit me if I  misbehave?"    I put the bed between us without a second's delay.
  My prisoner flung a  suit-case upon it, and tossed things into it with a dejected air;  suddenly, as he was fitting them in, without raising his  head (which I  was watching), his right hand closed over the barrel with which I  covered him.
    "You'd better not shoot," he said, a knee upon his side of the bed; "if  you do it may be as bad for you as it will be for me!"    I tried to wrest the revolver from him.
    "I will if you force me," I hissed.
    "You'd better not," he repeated, smiling; and now I saw that if I did I  should only shoot into the bed or my own legs.
  His hand was on the top  of mine, bending it down, and the revolver with it.
  The strength of it  was as the strength of ten of mine; and now both his knees were on the  bed; and suddenly I saw his other hand, doubled into a fist, coming up  slowly over the suit-case.
    "Help!" I called feebly.
    "Help, forsooth!  I begin to believe YOU ARE from the Yard," he  said--and his upper-cut came with the "Yard.
"  It caught me under the  chin.
    It lifted me off my legs.
  I have a dim recollection of the crash that  I made in falling.
      III    Raffles was standing over me when I recovered consciousness.
  I lay  stretched upon the bed across which that blackguard Belville had struck  his knavish blow.
  The suit-case was on the floor, but its dastardly  owner had disappeared.
    "Is he gone?" was my first faint question.
    "Thank God you're not, anyway!" replied Raffles, with what struck me  then as mere flippancy.
  I managed to raise myself upon one elbow.
    "I meant Lord Ernest Belville," said I, with dignity.
  "Are you quite  sure that he's cleared  out?"    Raffles waved a hand towards the window, which stood wide open to the  summer stars.
    "Of course," said he, "and by the route I intended him to take; he's  gone by the iron-ladder,  as I hoped he would.
  What on earth should we  have done with him?  My poor, dear Bunny, I thought you'd take a bribe!  But it's really more convincing as it is, and just as well for Lord  Ernest to be convinced for the time being.
"    "Are you sure he is?" I questioned, as I found a rather shaky pair of  legs.
    "Of course!" cried Raffles again, in the tone to make one blush for the  least misgiving on the  point.
  "Not that it matters one bit," he  added, airily, "for we have him either way; and when he does tumble to  it, as he may any minute, he won't dare to open his mouth.
"    "Then the sooner we clear out the better," said I, but I looked askance  at the open window, for my head was spinning still.
    "When you feel up to it," returned Raffles, "we shall STROLL out, and I  shall do myself the honor of ringing for the lift.
  The force of habit  is too strong in you, Bunny.
  I shall shut the window and leave  everything exactly as we found it.
  Lord Ernest will probably tumble  before he is badly missed; and then he may come back to put salt on us;  but I should like to know what he can do even if he succeeds!  Come,  Bunny, pull yourself together, and you'll be a different man when  you're in the open air.
"    And for a while I felt one, such was my relief at getting out of those  infernal mansions with unfettered wrists; this we managed easily  enough; but once more Raffles's performance of a small part was no less  perfect than his more ambitious work upstairs, and something of the  successful artist's elation possessed him as we walked arm-in-arm  across St.
 James's Park.
  It was long since I had known him so pleased  with himself, and only too long since he had had such reason.
    "I don't think I ever had a brighter idea in my life," he said; "never  thought of it till he was in the next room; never dreamt of its coming  off so ideally even then, and didn't much care, because we had him all  ways up.
  I'm only sorry you let him knock you out.
  I was waiting  outside the door all the time, and it made me sick to hear it.
  But I  once broke my own head, Bunny, if you  remember, and not in half such  an excellent cause!"    Raffles touched all his pockets in his turn, the pockets that contained  a small fortune apiece, and he smiled in my face as we crossed the  lighted avenues of the Mall.
  Next moment he was hailing a hansom--for  I suppose I was still pretty  pale--and not a word would he let me  speak until we had alighted as near as was prudent to the  flat.
    "What a brute I've been, Bunny!" he whispered  then, "but you take half  the swag, old boy, and right well you've earned it.
 No, we'll go in by  the wrong door and over the roof; it's too late for old Theobald to be  still at the play, and too early for him to be safely in his cups.
"    So we climbed the many stairs with cat-like stealth, and like cats  crept out upon the grimy leads.
  But to-night they were no blacker than  their canopy of sky; not a chimney-stack stood out against the starless  night; one had to feel one's way in order to avoid tripping over the  low parapets of the L-shaped wells that ran from roof to basement to  light the inner rooms.
  One of these wells was spanned by a flimsy  bridge with iron handrails that felt warm to the touch as Raffles led  the way across!  A hotter and a closer night I have never known.
    "The flat will be like an oven," I grumbled, at the head of our own  staircase.
    "Then we won't go down," said Raffles, promptly; "we'll slack it up  here for a bit instead.
  No, Bunny, you stay where you are! I'll fetch  you a drink and a deck-chair, and you shan't come down till you feel  more fit.
"    And I let him have his way, I will not say as usual, for I had even  less than my normal power of resistance that night.
  That villainous  upper-cut!  My head still sang and throbbed, as I seated  myself on one  of the aforesaid parapets, and buried it in my hot hands.
  Nor was the  night one to dispel a headache; there was distinct thunder in the air.
  Thus I sat in a heap, and brooded  over my misadventure, a pretty  figure of a subordinate villain, until the step came for which I  waited; and it never struck me that it came from the wrong direction.
    "You have been quick," said I, simply.
    "Yes," hissed a voice I recognized; "and you've got to be quicker  still!  Here, out with your wrists; no, one at a time; and if you utter  a syllable you're a dead man.
"    It was Lord Ernest Belville; his close-cropped, iron-gray moustache  gleamed through the darkness, drawn up over his set teeth.
  In his hand  glittered a pair of handcuffs, and before I knew it one had snapped its  jaws about my right wrist.
    "Now come this way," said Lord Ernest, showing me a revolver also, "and  wait for your friend.
  And, recollect, a single syllable of warning  will be your death!"    With that the ruffian led me to the very bridge I had just crossed at  Raffles's heels, and handcuffed me to the iron rail midway across the  chasm.
  It no longer felt warm to my touch, but icy as the blood in all  my veins.
    So this high-born hypocrite had beaten us at our game and his, and  Raffles had met his match at last!  That was the most intolerable  thought, that Raffles should be down in the flat on my account, and  that I could not warn him of his impending fate; for how was it  possible without  making such an outcry as should bring the mansions  about our ears?  And there I shivered on that wretched plank, chained  like Andromeda to the rock, with a black infinity above and below; and  before my eyes, now grown familiar with the  peculiar darkness, stood  Lord Ernest Belville, waiting for Raffles to emerge with full hands and  unsuspecting heart! Taken so horribly unawares, even Raffles must fall  an easy prey to a desperado in resource and courage scarcely second to  himself, but one whom he had fatally underrated from the beginning.
  Not that I paused to think how the thing had happened; my one concern  was for what was to happen next.
    And what did happen was worse than my worst foreboding, for first a  light came flickering into the  sort of companion-hatch at the head of  the stairs, and finally Raffles--in his shirt-sleeves! He was  not only  carrying a candle to put the finishing touch to him as a target; he had  dispensed with coat and waistcoat downstairs, and was at once  full-handed and unarmed.
    "Where are you, old chap?" he cried, softly, himself blinded by the  light he carried; and he advanced a couple of steps towards Belville.
  "This isn't you, is it?"    And Raffles stopped, his candle held on high, a folding chair under the  other arm.
    "No, I am not your friend," replied Lord Ernest, easily; "but kindly  remain standing exactly where you are, and don't lower that candle an  inch, unless you want your brains blown into the street.
"    Raffles said never a word, but for a moment did as he was bid; and the  unshaken flame of the candle was testimony alike to the stillness of  the night and to the finest set of nerves in Europe.
    Then, to my horror, he coolly stooped, placing candle and chair on the  leads, and his hands in his pockets, as though it were but a popgun  that covered him.
    "Why didn't you shoot?" he asked insolently as he rose.
 "Frightened of  the noise?  I should  be, too, with an old-pattern machine like that.
  All very well for service in the field--but on the house-tops at dead  of night!"    "I shall shoot, however," replied Lord Ernest, as quietly in his turn,  and with less insolence, "and chance the noise, unless you instantly  restore my property.
  I am glad you don't dispute the last word," he  continued after a slight pause.
  "There  is no keener honor than that  which subsists, or ought to subsist, among thieves; and I need hardly  say that I soon spotted you as one of the fraternity.
  Not in the  beginning, mind you!  For the moment I did think you were one of these  smart detectives jumped to life from some sixpenny  magazine; but to  preserve the illusion you ought to provide yourself with a worthier  lieutenant.
  It  was he who gave your show away," chuckled the wretch,  dropping for a moment the affected style of speech which seemed  intended to enhance our humiliation; "smart detectives don't go about  with little innocents to assist them.
  You needn't be  anxious about  him, by the way; it wasn't necessary to pitch him into the street; he  is to be seen though not heard, if you look in the right direction.
  Nor must you put all the blame upon your friend; it  was not he, but  you, who made so sure that I had got out by the window.
  You see, I was  in my bathroom all the time--with the door open.
"    "The bathroom, eh?" Raffles echoed with professional interest.
 "And you  followed us on foot across the park?"    "Of course.
"    "And then in a cab?"    "And afterwards on foot once more.
"    "The simplest skeleton would let you in down below.
"    I saw the lower half of Lord Ernest's face grinning in the light of the  candle set between them on the ground.
    "You follow every move," said he; "there can be no doubt you are one of  the fraternity; and I shouldn't wonder if we had formed our style upon  the same model.
  Ever know A.
 J.
 Raffles?"    The abrupt question took my breath away; but Raffles himself did not  lose an instant over his answer.
    "Intimately," said he.
    "That accounts for you, then," laughed Lord Ernest, "as it does for me,  though I never had the honor of the master's acquaintance.
  Nor is it  for me to say which is the worthier disciple.
  Perhaps, however, now  that your friend is handcuffed in mid-air, and you yourself are at my  mercy, you will concede me some little temporary advantage?"    And his face split in another grin from the cropped moustache downward,  as I saw no longer by candlelight but by a flash of lightning which  tore the sky in two before Raffles could  reply.
    "You have the bulge at present," admitted Raffles; "but you have still  to lay hands upon your, or our, ill-gotten goods.
  To shoot me is not  necessarily to do so; to bring either one of us to a violent end is  only to court a yet more violent and  infinitely more disgraceful one  for yourself.
  Family considerations alone should rule that risk out of  your game.
  Now, an hour or two ago, when the exact opposite--"    The remainder of Raffles's speech was drowned from my ears by the  belated crash of thunder  which the lightning had foretold.
  So loud,  however, was the crash when it came, that the storm was evidently  approaching us at a high velocity; yet as the last echo rumbled away, I  heard Raffles talking as though he had never stopped.
    "You offered us a share," he was saying; "unless you mean to murder us  both in cold blood, it will be worth your while to repeat that offer.
  We should be dangerous enemies; you had far better make the best of us  as friends.
"    "Lead the way down to your flat," said Lord Ernest, with a flourish of  his service revolver, "and perhaps we may talk about it.
  It is for me  to make the terms, I imagine, and in the first place I am not going to  get wet to the skin up here.
"    The rain was beginning in great drops, even as he spoke, and by a  second flash of lightning I saw Raffles pointing to me.
    "But what about my friend?" said he.
    And then came the second peal.
    "Oh, HE'S all right," the great brute replied;  "do him good! You don't  catch me letting myself in for two to one!"    "You will find it equally difficult," rejoined Raffles, "to induce me  to leave my friend to the mercy of a night like this.
 He has not  recovered from the blow you struck him in your own rooms.
  I am not  such a fool as to blame you for that, but you are a worse sportsman  than I take you for if you think of leaving him where he is.
  If he  stays, however, so do I.
"    And, just as it ceased, Raffles's voice seemed distinctly nearer to me;  but in the darkness and the rain, which was now as heavy as hail, I  could see nothing clearly.
  The rain had already extinguished the  candle.
  I heard an oath from Belville, a laugh from Raffles, and for a  second that was all.
  Raffles was coming to me, and the other could not  even see to fire; that was all I knew in the pitchy interval of  invisible rain before the next crash and the next flash.
    And then!    This time they came together, and not till my dying hour shall I forget  the sight that the lightning lit and the thunder applauded.
  Raffles  was on one of the parapets of the gulf that my foot-bridge spanned, and  in the sudden illumination he stepped across it as one might across a  garden path.
  The width was scarcely greater, but the  depth!  In the  sudden flare I saw to the concrete bottom of the well, and it looked no  larger than the hollow of my hand.
  Raffles was laughing in  my ear; he  had the iron railing fast; it was between us, but his foothold was as  secure as mine.
  Lord Ernest Belville, on the contrary, was the fifth  of a second late for the light, and half a foot short in his spring.
  Something struck our plank bridge so hard as to set it quivering like a  harp-string; there was half a gasp and half a sob in mid-air beneath  our feet; and then a sound far below that I prefer not to describe.
  I  am not sure that I could hit upon the perfect simile; it is more than  enough for me that I can hear it still.
  And with that sickening sound  came the loudest clap of thunder yet, and a great white glare that  showed us our enemy's body far below, with one white hand spread like a  starfish, but the head of him mercifully twisted underneath.
    "It was all his own fault, Bunny.
  Poor devil!  May he and all of us be  forgiven; but pull yourself together for your own sake.
 Well, you can't  fall; stay where you are a minute.
"    I remember the uproar of the elements while Raffles was gone; no other  sound mingled with it; not the opening of a single window, not the  uplifting of a single voice.
  Then came Raffles with soap and water,  and the gyve was wheedled from one wrist, as you withdraw a ring for  which the finger has grown too large.
  Of the rest, I only remember  shivering till morning in a pitch-dark flat, whose invalid occupier was  for once the nurse, and I his patient.
    And that is the true ending of the episode in which we two set  ourselves to catch one of our own kidney, albeit in another place I  have shirked  the whole truth.
  It is not a grateful task to show  Raffles as completely at fault as he really was on that occasion; nor  do I derive any subtle satisfaction from recounting my own twofold  humiliation, or from having assisted never so indirectly in the death  of a not uncongenial sinner.
  The truth, however, has after all a merit  of its own, and the great kinsfolk of poor Lord Ernest have but little  to lose by its divulgence.
  It would seem that they knew more of the  real character of the apostle of Rational Drink than was known at  Exeter Hall.
  The tragedy was indeed hushed up, as tragedies only are  when they occur in such circles.
  But the rumor that did get abroad, as  to the class of enterprise which the poor scamp was pursuing when he  met his death, cannot be too soon exploded, since it breathed upon the  fair fame of some of the most respectable flats in Kensington.
        AN OLD FLAME    I    The square shall be nameless, but if you drive due west from Piccadilly  the cab-man will eventually find it on his left, and he ought to thank  you for two shillings.
  It is not a fashionable square, but there are  few with a finer garden,  while the studios on the south side lend  distinction of another sort.
 The houses, however, are small and dingy,  and about the last to attract the expert practitioner in search of a  crib.
  Heaven knows it was with no such thought I trailed Raffles  thither, one unlucky evening at the latter end of that same season,  when Dr.
 Theobald had at last insisted upon the bath-chair which I had  foreseen in the beginning.
  Trees whispered in the green garden  aforesaid, and the cool, smooth lawns looked so inviting that I  wondered whether some philanthropic resident could not be induced to  lend us the key.
  But Raffles would not listen to the suggestion, when  I stopped to make it, and what was worse, I found him looking wistfully  at the little houses instead.
    "Such balconies, Bunny!  A leg up, and there you would be!"    I expressed a conviction that there would be nothing worth taking in  the square, but took care to have him under way again as I spoke.
    "I daresay you're right," sighed Raffles.
  "Rings and watches, I  suppose, but it would be hard luck to take them from people who live in  houses like these.
  I don't know, though.
  Here's one with an extra  story.
  Stop, Bunny; if you don't stop I'll hold on to the railings!  This is a good house; look at the knocker and the electric bell.
  They've had that put in.
  There's some money here, my rabbit!  I dare  bet there's a silver-table in the drawing-room; and the windows are  wide open.
  Electric light, too, by Jove!"    Since stop I must, I had done so on the other side of the road, in the  shadow of the leafy palings, and as Raffles spoke the ground floor  windows opposite had flown alight, showing as pretty a little  dinner-table as one could wish to see, with a man at his wine at the  far end, and the back  of a lady in evening dress toward us.
  It was  like a lantern-picture thrown upon a screen.
 There were only the pair  of them, but the table was brilliant with silver and gay with flowers,  and the maid waited with the indefinable air of a good servant.
  It  certainly seemed a good house.
    "She's going to let down the blind!" whispered Raffles, in high  excitement.
  "No, confound them, they've told her not to.
  Mark down  her necklace, Bunny, and invoice his stud.
  What a brute he looks!  But  I like the table, and that's her show.
  She has the taste; but he must  have money.
  See the festive picture over the sideboard?  Looks  to me  like a Jacques Saillard.
  But that silver-table would be good enough  for me.
"    "Get on," said I.
  "You're in a bath-chair.
"    "But the whole square's at dinner!  We should have the ball at our  feet.
  It wouldn't take two twos!"    "With those blinds up, and the cook in the kitchen underneath?"    He nodded, leaning forward in the chair, his hands upon the wraps about  his legs.
    "You must be mad," said I, and got back to my handles with the word,  but when I tugged the chair ran light.
    "Keep an eye on the rug," came in a whisper from the middle of the  road; and there stood my invalid, his pale face in a quiver of pure  mischief, yet set with his insane resolve.
  "I'm only going to see  whether that woman has a silver-table--"    "We don't want it--"    "It won't take a minute--"    "It's madness, madness--"    "Then don't you wait!"    It was like him to leave me with that, and this time I had taken him at  his last word had not  my own given me an idea.
  Mad I had called him,  and mad I could declare him upon oath if  necessary.
 It was not as  though the thing had happened far from home.
  They could learn all  about us at the nearest mansions.
  I referred them  to Dr.
 Theobald;  this was a Mr. Maturin, one of his patients, and I was his keeper, and  he had never given me the slip before.
  I heard myself making these  explanations on the doorstep, and pointing to the deserted bath-chair  as the proof, while the pretty parlor maid ran for the police.
  It  would be a more serious matter for me than for my charge.
  I should  lose my place.
  No, he had never done such a thing before, and I would  answer for it that he never should again.
    I saw myself conducting Raffles back to his chair, with a firm hand and  a stern tongue.
  I  heard him thanking me in whispers on the way  home.
  It would be the first tight place I had ever got him out of, and I was  quite anxious for him to get into it, so sure was I of every move.
  My  whole position had altered in the few seconds that it took me to follow  this illuminating train of ideas; it was now so strong that I could  watch Raffles without much anxiety.
  And he was worth watching.
    He had stepped boldly but softly to the front door, and there he was  still waiting, ready to ring if the door opened or a face appeared in  the  area, and doubtless to pretend that he had rung already.
  But he  had not to ring at all; and suddenly I saw his foot in the letter-box,  his left hand on the lintel overhead.
  It was thrilling, even to a  hardened accomplice with an explanation up his  sleeve!  A tight grip  with that left hand of his,  as he leant backward with all his weight  upon those five fingers; a right arm stretched outward and upward to  its last inch; and the base of the low, projecting balcony was safely  caught.
    I looked down and took breath.
  The maid was removing the crumbs in the  lighted room, and the square was empty as before.
  What a blessing it  was the end of the season!  Many of the houses remained in darkness.
  I  looked up again, and Raffles was drawing his left leg over the balcony  railing.
  In another moment he had disappeared through one of the  French windows which opened upon the balcony, and in yet another he had  switched on the electric light within.
  This was bad enough, for now I,  at least, could see everything he did; but the crowning folly was still  to come.
 There was no point in it; the mad thing was done for my  benefit, as I knew at once and he afterward confessed; but the lunatic  reappeared on the balcony, bowing like a mountebank--in his crape mask!    I set off with the empty chair, but I came back.
  I could not desert  old Raffles, even when I would, but must try to explain away his mask  as well, if  he had not the sense to take it off in time.
  It  would be  difficult, but burglaries are not usually committed from a bath-chair,  and for the rest I put my faith in Dr.
 Theobald.
  Meanwhile Raffles had  at least withdrawn from the balcony, and now  I could only see his head  as he peered into a cabinet at the other side of the room.
  It was like  the opera of Aida, in which two scenes are enacted simultaneously, one  in the dungeon below, the other in the temple above.
  In the same  fashion my attention now became divided between the picture of Raffles  moving stealthily about the upper room, and that of the husband and  wife at table underneath.
  And all at once, as the man replenished his  glass with a shrug of the shoulders, the woman pushed back her chair  and sailed to the door.
    Raffles was standing before the fireplace upstairs.
  He had taken one  of the framed photographs from the chimney-piece, and was scanning it  at suicidal length through the eye-holes in the hideous mask which he  still wore.
  He would need it after all.
 The lady had left the room  below, opening and shutting the door for herself; the man was filling  his glass once more.
  I would have shrieked my warning to Raffles, so  fatally engrossed overhead, but at this moment (of all  others) a  constable (of all men) was marching sedately down our side of the  square.
  There was nothing for it but to turn a melancholy eye upon the  bath-chair, and to ask the constable the time.
  I was evidently to be  kept there all night, I remarked, and only realized with the words that  they disposed of my other explanations before they were uttered.
  It  was a horrible moment for such a discovery.
 Fortunately the enemy was  on the pavement, from which he could scarcely have seen more than the  drawing-room ceiling, had he looked; but he was not many houses distant  when a door opened and a woman gasped so that I  heard both across the  road.
  And never shall I forget the subsequent tableaux in the lighted  room behind the low balcony and the French windows.
    Raffles stood confronted by a dark and handsome woman whose profile, as  I saw it first in the electric light, is cut like a cameo in my memory.
  It had the undeviating line of brow and nose, the  short upper lip, the  perfect chin, that are united  in marble oftener than in the flesh; and  like marble she stood, or rather like some beautiful pale bronze; for  that was her coloring, and she lost none of it that I could see,  neither trembled; but her bosom rose and fell, and that was all.
  So  she stood without flinching before a masked ruffian, who, I felt, would  be the first to appreciate her courage; to me it was so superb that I  could think of it in this way even then, and marvel how Raffles himself  could stand unabashed before so brave a figure.
  He had not to do so  long.
  The woman scorned him, and he stood unmoved, a framed  photograph still in his hand.
  Then, with a quick, determined movement  she turned, not to the door or to the bell, but to the open window by  which Raffles had entered; and this with that accursed policeman still  in view.
 So far no word had passed between the pair.
  But at this point  Raffles said something, I could not hear what, but at the sound of his  voice the woman wheeled.
  And Raffles was looking humbly in her face,  the crape mask snatched from his own.
    "Arthur!" she cried; and that might have been heard in the middle of  the square garden.
    Then they stood gazing at each other, neither unmoved any more, and  while they stood the street-door opened and banged.
  It was her husband  leaving the house, a fine figure of a man, but a dissipated face, and a  step even now distinguished  by the extreme caution which precedes  unsteadiness.
  He broke the spell.
 His wife came to the  balcony, then  looked back into the room, and yet again along the road, and this time  I saw her face.
  It was the face of one glancing indeed from Hyperion  to a satyr.
 And then I saw the rings flash, as her hand fell gently  upon Raffles's arm.
    They disappeared from that window.
  Their heads showed for an instant  in the next.
  Then they dipped out of sight, and an inner ceiling  flashed out under a new light; they had gone into the back  drawing-room, beyond my ken.
  The  maid came up with coffee, her  mistress hastily met her at the door, and once more disappeared.
  The  square was as quiet as ever.
  I remained some minutes where I was.
  Now  and then I thought I heard their voices in the back drawing-room.
  I  was seldom sure.
    My state of mind may be imagined by those readers who take an interest  in my personal psychology.
  It does not amuse me to look back upon it.
  But at length I had the sense to put myself in Raffles's place.
  He had  been recognized at last, he had come to life.
  Only one person knew as  yet,  but that person was a woman, and a woman who had once been fond  of him, if the human face could speak.
  Would she keep his secret?  Would  he tell her where he lived?  It was terrible to think we were  such neighbors, and with the thought that it was terrible came a little  enlightenment as to what could still be done for the best.
  He would  not tell her where he lived.
  I knew him too well for that.
 He would  run for it when he could, and the bath-chair and I must not be there to  give him away.
  I dragged the infernal vehicle round the nearer corner.
  Then I waited--there could be no harm in that--and at last he came.
    He was walking briskly, so I was right, and he had not played the  invalid to her; yet I heard him cry out with pleasure as he turned the  corner, and he flung himself into the chair with a long-drawn sigh that  did me good.
    "Well done, Bunny--well done!  I am on my way to Earl's Court, she's  capable of following me, but she won't look for me in a bath-chair.
  Home, home, home, and not another word till we get there!"    Capable of following him?  She overtook us  before we were past the  studios on the south side of the square, the woman herself, in a hooded  opera-cloak.
  But she never gave us a glance, and we saw her turn  safely in the right direction for Earl's Court, and the wrong one for  our humble mansions.
  Raffles thanked his gods in a voice that  trembled, and five minutes later we were in the flat.
  Then for once it  was Raffles who filled the tumblers and found the cigarettes, and for  once (and once only in all my knowledge of him) did he drain his glass  at a draught.
    "You didn't see the balcony scene?" he asked at length; and they were  his first words since the woman passed us on his track.
    "Do you mean when she came in?"    "No, when I came down.
"    "I didn't.
"    "I hope nobody else saw it," said Raffles devoutly.
  "I don't say that  Romeo and Juliet were brother and sister to us.
  But you might have  said so, Bunny!"    He was staring at the carpet with as wry a face as lover ever wore.
    "An old flame?" said I, gently.
    "A married woman," he groaned.
    "So I gathered.
"    "But she always was one, Bunny," said he, ruefully.
  "That's the  trouble.
  It makes all the difference in the world!"    I saw the difference, but said I did not see how it could make any now.
  He had eluded the lady, after all; had we not seen her off upon a scent  as false as scent could be?  There was occasion for redoubled caution  in the future, but none for immediate anxiety.
  I quoted the bedside  Theobald, but Raffles did not smile.
  His eyes had been downcast all  this time, and now, when he raised them, I perceived that my comfort  had been administered to deaf ears.
    "Do you know who she is?" said he.
    "Not from Eve.
"    "Jacques Saillard," he said, as though now I must know.
    But the name left me cold and stolid.
  I had heard it, but that was  all.
  It was lamentable ignorance, I am aware, but I had specialized in  Letters at the expense of Art.
    "You must know her pictures," said Raffles, patiently; "but I suppose  you thought she was a man.
  They would appeal to you, Bunny; that  festive piece over the sideboard was her work.
 Sometimes they risk her  at the Academy, sometimes they fight shy.
 She has one of those studios  in the same square; they used to live up near  Lord's.
"    My mind was busy brightening a dim memory of nymphs reflected in woody  pools.
  "Of course!"  I exclaimed, and added something about "a clever  woman.
"  Raffles rose at the phrase.
    "A clever woman!" he echoed, scornfully; "if she were only that I  should feel safe as houses.
  Clever women can't forget their  cleverness, they carry it as badly as a boy does his wine, and are  about as dangerous.
  I don't call Jacques Saillard clever outside her  art, but neither do I call her a woman at all.
  She does man's work  over a man's name, has the will of any ten men I ever knew, and I don't  mind telling you that I fear her more than any person on God's earth.
  I broke with her once," said Raffles, grimly, "but I know her.
  If I  had been asked to name the one person in London by whom I was keenest  NOT to be bowled out, I should have named Jacques Saillard.
"    That he had never before named her to me was as characteristic as the  reticence with which Raffles  spoke of their past relations, and even  of their conversation in the back drawing-room that evening.
    It was a question of principle with him, and one that I like to  remember.
  "Never give a woman away, Bunny," he used to say; and he  said it again to-night, but with a heavy cloud upon him, as though his  chivalry was sorely tried.
    "That's all right," said I, "if you're not going to be given away  yourself.
"    "That's just it, Bunny!  That's just--"    The words were out of him, it was too late to recall them.
  I had hit  the nail upon the head.
    "So she threatened you," I said, "did she?"    "I didn't say so," he replied, coldly.
    "And she is mated with a clown!" I pursued.
    "How she ever married him," he admitted, "is a mystery to me.
"    "It always is," said I, the wise man for once, and rather enjoying the  role.
    "Southern blood?"    "Spanish.
"    "She'll be pestering you to run off with her, old chap," said I.
    Raffles was pacing the room.
  He stopped in his stride for half a  second.
  So she had begun pestering him already!  It is wonderful how  acute any fool can be in the affairs of his friend.
    But  Raffles resumed his walk without a syllable, and I retreated to  safer ground.
    "So you sent her to Earl's Court," I mused aloud; and at last he smiled.
    "You'll be interested to hear, Bunny," said he, "that I am now living  in Seven Dials, and Bill Sikes couldn't hold a farthing dip to me.
  Bless you, she had my old police record at her fingers' ends, but it  was fit to frame compared with the one  I gave her.
  I had sunk as low  as they dig.
  I divided my nights between the open parks and a thieves'  kitchen in Seven Dials.
  If I was decently dressed it was because I had  stolen the suit down the Thames Valley beat the night before last.
  I  was on my way back when first that sleepy square, and then her open  window, proved too much for me.
  You should have heard me beg her to  let me push on to the devil in my own way; there I spread  myself, for  I meant every word; but I swore the final stage would be a six-foot  drop.
"    "You did lay it on," said I.
    "It was necessary, and that had its effect.
  She let me go.
  But at the  last moment she said she didn't believe I was so black as I painted  myself, and then there was the balcony scene you missed.
"    So that was all.
  I could not help telling him that he had got out of  it better than he deserved for ever getting in.
  Next moment I  regretted the  remark.
    "If I have got out of it," said Raffles, doubtfully.
  "We are  dreadfully near neighbors, and I can't move in a minute, with old  Theobald taking a grave view of my case.
  I suppose I had better lie  low, and thank the gods again for putting her off the scent for the  time being.
"    No doubt our conversation was carried beyond this point, but it  certainly was not many minutes later, nor had we left the subject, when  the electric bell thrilled us both to a sudden silence.
    "The doctor?" I queried, hope fighting with my horror.
    "It was a single ring.
"    "The last post?"    "You know he knocks, and it's long past his time.
"    The electric bell rang again, but now as though it never would stop.
    "You go, Bunny," said Raffles, with decision.
  His eyes were sparkling.
  His smile was firm.
    "What am I to say?"    "If it's the lady let her in.
"    It was the lady, still in her evening cloak, with her fine dark head  half-hidden by the hood, and an engaging contempt of appearances upon  her angry face.
  She was even handsomer than I had thought, and her  beauty of a bolder type, but she was also angrier than I had  anticipated when I came so readily to the door.
  The passage into which  it opened was an exceedingly narrow one, as I have often said, but I  never dreamt of barring this woman's way, though not a word did she  stoop to say to me.
  I was only too glad to flatten myself against the  wall, as the rustling fury strode past me into the lighted room with  the open door.
    "So this is your thieves' kitchen!" she cried, in high-pitched scorn.
    I was on the threshold myself, and Raffles glanced towards me with  raised eyebrows.
    "I have certainly had better quarters in my day," said he, "but you  need not call them absurd names before my man.
"    "Then send your 'man' about his business," said Jacques Saillard, with  an unpleasant stress upon the word indicated.
    But when the door was shut I heard Raffles assuring her that I knew  nothing, that he was a real invalid overcome by a sudden mad  temptation, and all he had told her of his life a lie to hide his  whereabouts, but all he was telling her now she could prove for herself  without leaving that building.
  It seemed, however, that she had proved  it already by going first to the porter below stairs.
  Yet I do not  think she cared one atom which story was the truth.
    "So you thought I could pass you in your chair,"  she said, "or ever in  this world again, without hearing from my heart that it was you!"      II    "Bunny," said Raffles, "I'm awfully sorry, old chap, but you've got to  go.
"    It was some weeks since the first untimely visitation of Jacques  Saillard, but there had been many others at all hours of the day, while  Raffles had  been induced to pay at least one to her studio in the  neighboring square.
  These intrusions he had endured at first with an  air of humorous resignation which imposed upon me less than he  imagined.
  The woman meant well, he said, after all, and could be  trusted to keep his secret loyally.
  It was plain to me, however, that  Raffles did not trust her, and that his pretence upon the point was a  deliberate pose to conceal the extent to which she had him in her  power.
  Otherwise there would have been little point in hiding anything  from the one person in possession of the cardinal secret of his  identity.
    But Raffles thought it worth his while to hoodwink Jacques Saillard in  the subsidiary matter of his health, in which Dr.
 Theobald lent him  unwitting assistance, and, as we have seen, to impress upon  her that I  was actually his attendant, and as ignorant of his past as the doctor  himself.
  "So you're all right, Bunny," he had assured me; "she thinks  you knew nothing the other night.
  I told you she wasn't a clever woman  outside her work.
  But hasn't she a will!"  I told Raffles it was very  considerate of him to keep me out of it, but that it seemed to me like  tying up the bag when the cat had escaped.
  His reply was an admission  that one must be on the defensive with such a woman and in such a case.
  Soon after this, Raffles, looking far  from well, fell back upon his  own last line of  defence, namely, his bed; and now, as always in the  end, I could see some sense in his subtleties, since it was  comparatively easy for me to turn even Jacques Saillard from the door,  with Dr.
 Theobald's explicit injunctions, and with my own honesty  unquestioned.
  So for a day we had peace once more.
  Then came letters,  then the doctor again and again, and finally my dismissal in the  incredible words which have necessitated these explanations.
    "Go?" I echoed.
  "Go where?"    "It's that ass Theobald," said Raffles.
  "He insists.
"    "On my going altogether?"    He nodded.
    "And you mean to let him have his way?"    I had no language for my mortification and disgust, though neither was  as yet quite so great as my  surprise.
  I had foreseen almost every  conceivable consequence of the mad act which brought all this trouble  to pass, but a voluntary division between Raffles and me had certainly  never entered my calculations.
  Nor could I think that it had occurred  to him before our egregious doctor's last visit, this very morning.
  Raffles had looked irritated as he broke the news to me from his  pillow, and now there was some sympathy in the way he sat up in bed, as  though he felt the thing himself.
    "I am obliged to give in to the fellow," said he.
  "He's saving me from  my friend, and I'm bound to humor him.
  But I can tell you that we've  been arguing about you for the last half hour, Bunny.
  It was no use;  the idiot has had his knife in you from the first; and he wouldn't see  me through on any other conditions.
"    "So he is going to see you through, is he?"    "It tots up to that," said Raffles, looking at me rather hard.
 "At all  events he has come to my rescue for the time being, and it's for me to  manage the rest.
  You don't know what it has been, Bunny,  these last  few weeks; and gallantry forbids that I should tell you even now.
  But  would you rather elope against your will, or have your continued  existence made known to the world in general and the police in  particular?  That is practically the problem which I have had to solve,  and the temporary  solution was to fall ill.
  As a matter of fact, I am  ill; and now what do you think?  I owe it to you to  tell you, Bunny,  though it goes against the grain.
  She would take me 'to the dear, warm  underworld,  where the sun really shines,' and she would 'nurse me back  to life and love!'  The artistic temperament is a fearsome thing,  Bunny, in a woman with the devil's own will!"    Raffles tore up the letter from which he had read these piquant  extracts, and lay back on the pillows  with the tired air of the  veritable invalid which he seemed able to assume at will.
  But for once  he did look as though bed was the best place for him; and I used the  fact as an argument for my own retention in defiance of Dr.
 Theobald.
  The town was full of typhoid, I said, and certainly that autumnal  scourge was in the air.
  Did he want me to leave him at the very moment  when he might be sickening for a serious illness?    "You know I don't, my good fellow," said Raffles, wearily; "but  Theobald does, and I can't  afford to go against him now.
  Not that I  really care what happens to me now that that woman knows I'm in the  land of the living; she'll let it out, to a dead certainty, and at the  best there'll be  a hue and cry, which is the very thing I have escaped  all these years.
  Now, what I want you  to do is to go and take some  quiet place somewhere, and then let me know, so that I may have a port  in the storm when it breaks.
"    "Now you're talking!" I cried, recovering my spirits.
  "I thought you  meant to go and drop a fellow altogether!"    "Exactly the sort of thing you would think," rejoined Raffles, with a  contempt that was welcome enough after my late alarm.
 "No, my dear  rabbit, what you've got to do is to make a new burrow for us both.
  Try  down the Thames, in some quiet nook that a literary man would naturally  select.
  I've often thought that more use might be made of a boat,  while the family are at dinner, than there ever has been yet.
  If  Raffles is to come to life, old chap, he shall go a-Raffling for all  he's worth!  There's something to be done with a bicycle, too.
  Try Ham  Common or Roehampton, or some such sleepy hollow a trifle off the line;  and say you're expecting your brother from the colonies.
"    Into this arrangement I entered without the slightest hesitation, for  we had funds enough to carry it out on a comfortable scale, and Raffles  placed a sufficient share at my disposal for the nonce.
  Moreover, I  for one was only too glad to seek fresh fields and pastures new--a  phrase which  I determined to interpret literally in my choice of fresh  surroundings.
  I was tired of our submerged life in the poky little  flat, especially now that we  had money enough for better things.
  I  myself of late had dark dealings with the receivers, with the result  that poor Lord Ernest Belville's successes were now indeed ours.
  Subsequent complications had been the more galling on that account,  while the wanton way in which they had been  created was the most  irritating reflection of all.
  But it had brought its own punishment  upon Raffles, and I fancied the lesson would prove salutary when we  again settled down.
    "If ever we do, Bunny!" said he, as I took his hand and told him how I  was already looking forward to the time.
    "But of course we will!" I cried, concealing the resentment at leaving  him which his tone and his appearance renewed in my breast.
    "I'm not so sure of it," he said, gloomily.
  "I'm in somebody's  clutches, and I've got to get out of them first.
"    "I'll sit tight until you do.
"    "Well," he said, "if you don't see me in ten days you never will.
"    "Only ten days?" I echoed.
  "That's nothing at all.
"    "A lot may happen in ten days," replied Raffles, in the same depressing  tone, so very depressing in him; and with that he held out his hand a  second time, and dropped mine suddenly after as sudden a pressure for  farewell.
    I left the flat in considerable dejection after all, unable to decide  whether Raffles was really ill, or only worried as I knew him to be.
  And at the foot of the stairs the author of my dismissal, that  confounded Theobald, flung open his door and waylaid me.
    "Are you going?" he demanded.
    The traps in my hands proclaimed that I was, but I dropped them at his  feet to have it out with him then and there.
    "Yes," I answered fiercely, "thanks to you!"    "Well, my good fellow," he said, his full-blooded face lightening and  softening at the same  time, as though a load were off his mind, "it's  no pleasure to me to deprive any man of his billet, but you never were  a nurse, and you know that as well as I do.
"    I began to wonder what he meant, and how much he did know, and my  speculations kept me silent.
  "But come in here a moment," he  continued, just as I decided that he knew nothing at all.
  And, leading  me into his minute consulting-room,  Dr.
 Theobald solemnly presented me  with a sovereign by way of compensation, which I pocketed as solemnly,  and with as much gratitude as if I had not fifty of them distributed  over my person as it was.
  The good fellow had quite forgotten my  social status, about which he himself had been so particular at our  earliest interview; but he had  never accustomed himself to treat me as  a gentleman, and I do not suppose he had been improving his memory by  the tall tumbler which I saw him poke behind a photograph as we entered.
    "There's one thing I should like to know before I go," said I, turning  suddenly on the doctor's mat, "and that is whether Mr. Maturin is  really ill or not!"    I meant, of course, at the present moment, but Dr.
 Theobald braced  himself like a recruit at the drill-sergeant's voice.
    "Of course he is," he snapped--"so ill as to need a nurse who can  nurse, by way of a change.
"    With that his door shut in my face, and I had to go my way, in the dark  as to whether he had mistaken my meaning, and was telling me a lie, or  not.
    But for my misgivings upon this point I might have extracted some very  genuine enjoyment out of the next few days.
  I had decent clothes to my  back, with money, as I say, in most of the pockets, and more freedom to  spend it than was possible  in the constant society of a man whose  personal liberty depended on a universal supposition that  he was dead.
  Raffles was as bold as ever, and I as fond of him, but whereas he would  run any risk in a professional exploit, there were many innocent  recreations still open to me which would have been sheer madness in  him.
  He could not even watch a match, from the sixpenny seats, at  Lord's cricket-ground, where the Gentlemen were every year in a worse  way without him.
  He never travelled by rail, and dining out was a risk  only to be run with some ulterior object in view.
  In fact, much as it  had changed, Raffles could no longer show his face with perfect  impunity in any quarter or at any hour.
 Moreover, after the lesson he  had now learnt, I foresaw increased caution on his part in this  respect.
  But I myself was under no such perpetual disadvantage, and,  while what was good enough for Raffles was quite good enough for me so  long as we were together, I saw no harm in profiting by the present  opportunity of "doing my-self well.
"    Such were my reflections on the way to Richmond in a hansom cab.
  Richmond had struck us both as the best centre of operations in search  of the suburban retreat which Raffles wanted, and by road, in a  well-appointed, well-selected hansom, was certainly the most agreeable  way of getting there.
  In a week or ten days Raffles was to write to me  at the Richmond post-office, but for at least a week I should be "on my  own.
"  It was not an unpleasant sensation as I leant back in the  comfortable hansom, and rather to one side, in order to have a good  look at myself in the bevelled mirror that is almost as great an  improvement in these vehicles as the rubber tires.
  Really I was not an  ill-looking youth, if one may call one's self such at the age of  thirty.
  I could lay no claim either to the striking cast of  countenance or to the peculiar charm of expression which made the face  of  Raffles like no other in the world.
  But this very distinction was  in itself a danger, for its impression was indelible, whereas I might  still have been mistaken for a hundred other young fellows at large in  London.
  Incredible as it may appear to the moralists, I had sustained  no external hallmark  by my term of imprisonment, and I am vain enough  to believe that the evil which I did had not a separate existence in my  face.
  This afternoon, indeed, I was struck by the purity of my fresh  complexion,  and rather depressed by the general innocence of the  visage which peered into mine from the little  mirror.
  My  straw-colored moustache, grown in the flat after a protracted holiday,  again preserved the most disappointing dimensions, and was still  invisible in certain lights without wax.
  So far  from discerning the  desperate criminal who has "done time" once, and deserved it over and  over again, the superior but superficial observer might have imagined  that he detected a certain element of folly in my face.
    At all events it was not the face to shut the doors of a first-class  hotel against me, without accidental evidence of a more explicit kind,  and it was with no little satisfaction that I directed the man to drive  to the Star and Garter.
  I also told him to  go through Richmond Park,  though he warned me that it would add considerably to the distance and  his fare.
  It was autumn, and it struck me that the tints would be  fine.
  And I had learnt from Raffles to appreciate such things, even  amid the excitement of an audacious enterprise.
    If I dwell upon my appreciation of this occasion it is because, like  most pleasures, it was exceedingly short-lived.
  I was very comfortable  at the Star and Garter, which was so empty that I had a room worthy of  a prince, where I could  enjoy the finest of all views (in patriotic  opinion) every morning while I shaved.
  I walked many miles through the  noble park, over the commons of Ham and Wimbledon, and one day as far  as  that of Esher, where I was forcibly reminded of a service we once  rendered to a distinguished resident in this delightful locality.
  But  it was on Ham  Common, one of the places which Raffles had mentioned as  specially desirable, that I actually found an almost ideal retreat.
  This was a cottage where I heard, on inquiry, that rooms were to be let  in  the summer.
  The landlady, a motherly body, of  visible excellence,  was surprised indeed at receiving an application for the winter months;  but I  have generally found that the title of "author,"  claimed with  an air, explains every little innocent irregularity of conduct or  appearance, and even requires something of the kind to carry conviction  to the lay intelligence.
  The present case was one in point, and when I  said that I could only write in a room facing north, on mutton chops  and milk,  with a cold ham in the wardrobe in case of nocturnal  inspiration, to which I was liable, my literary character was  established beyond dispute.
  I secured the rooms, paid a month's rent  in advance at my own request, and moped in them dreadfully until the  week was up and Raffles due any day.
  I explained that the inspiration  would not come, and asked abruptly if the mutton was New Zealand.
    Thrice had I made fruitless inquiries at the Richmond post-office; but  on the tenth day I was in and out almost every hour.
  Not a word was  there for me up to the last post at night.
 Home I trudged to Ham with  horrible forebodings, and  back again to Richmond after breakfast next  morning.
  Still there was nothing.
  I could bear it no more.
  At ten  minutes to eleven I was climbing the station stairs at Earl's Court.
    It was a wretched morning there, a weeping  mist shrouding the long,  straight street, and clinging to one's face in clammy caresses.
  I felt  how  much better it was down at Ham, as I turned into our side street,  and saw the flats looming like mountains, the chimney-pots hidden in  the mist.
  At our entrance stood a nebulous conveyance, that I took at  first for a tradesman's van; to my horror it proved to be a hearse; and  all at once the white breath ceased upon my lips.
    I had looked up at our windows and the blinds were down!    I rushed within.
  The doctor's door stood open.
  I neither knocked nor  rang, but found him in his consulting-room with red eyes and a blotchy  face.
  Otherwise he was in solemn black from head to  heel.
    "Who is dead?" I burst out.
  "Who is dead?"    The red eyes looked redder than ever as Dr.
 Theobald opened them at the  unwarrantable sight of me; and he was terribly slow in answering.
  But  in the end he did answer, and did not kick me out as he evidently had a  mind.
    "Mr. Maturin," he said, and sighed like a beaten man.
    I said nothing.
  It was no surprise to me.
  I had known it all these  minutes.
  Nay, I had dreaded this from the first, had divined it at the  last, though to the last also I had refused to entertain my own  conviction.
  Raffles dead!  A real invalid after all!  Raffles dead,  and on the point of burial!    "What did he die of?" I asked, unconsciously drawing on that fund of  grim self-control which the weakest of us seem to hold in reserve for  real calamity.
    "Typhoid," he answered.
  "Kensington is full of it.
"    "He was sickening for it when I left, and you knew it, and could get  rid of me then!"    "My good fellow, I was obliged to have a more experienced nurse for  that very reason.
"    The doctor's tone was so conciliatory that I remembered in an instant  what a humbug the man was, and became suddenly possessed with the vague  conviction that he was imposing upon me now.
    "Are you sure it was typhoid at all?" I cried fiercely to his face.
  "Are you sure it wasn't suicide--or murder?"    I confess that I can see little point in this speech as I write it  down, but it was what I said in a burst of grief and of wild suspicion;  nor was it without effect upon Dr.
 Theobald, who turned bright scarlet  from his well-brushed hair to his immaculate collar.
    "Do you want me to throw you out into the street?" he cried; and all at  once I remembered that I had come to Raffles as a perfect stranger, and  for his sake might as well preserve that character to the last.
    "I beg your pardon," I said, brokenly.
  "He  was so good to me--I  became so attached to him.
  You forget I am originally of his class.
"    "I did forget it," replied Theobald, looking relieved at my new tone,  "and I beg YOUR pardon for doing so.
  Hush!  They are bringing him  down.
  I must have a drink before we start, and you'd  better join me.
"    There was no pretence about his drink this time, and a pretty stiff one  it was, but I fancy my own must have run it hard.
  In my case it cast a  merciful haze over much of the next hour, which I can  truthfully  describe as one of the most painful of  my whole existence.
  I can have  known very little of what I was doing.
  I only remember finding myself  in a hansom, suddenly wondering why it was going so slowly, and once  more awaking to the truth.
  But it was to the truth itself more than to  the liquor that I must have owed my dazed condition.
  My next  recollection is of looking down into the open grave, in a sudden  passionate anxiety to see the name for myself.
  It was not the name of  my friend, of course, but it was the one under which he had passed for  many months.
    I was still stupefied by a sense of inconceivable loss, and had not  raised my eyes from that which was slowly forcing me to realize what  had happened, when there was a rustle at my elbow, and a shower of  hothouse flowers passed before them,  falling like huge snowflakes  where my gaze had  rested.
  I looked up, and at my side stood a  majestic figure in deep mourning.
  The face was  carefully veiled, but  I was too close not to recognize the masterful beauty whom the world  knew  as Jacques Saillard.
  I had no sympathy with her; on the  contrary, my blood boiled with the vague conviction that in some way  she was responsible  for this death.
  Yet she was the only woman  present--there were not a half a dozen of us altogether--and her  flowers were the only flowers.
    The melancholy ceremony was over, and Jacques Saillard had departed in  a funeral brougham, evidently hired for the occasion.
 I had  watched  her drive away, and the sight of my own cabman, making signs to me  through the fog, had  suddenly reminded me that I had bidden him to  wait.
  I was the last to leave, and had turned my back upon the  grave-diggers, already at their final task, when a hand fell lightly  but firmly upon my shoulder.
    "I don't want to make a scene in a cemetery,"  said a voice, in a not  unkindly, almost confidential whisper.
  "Will you get into your own cab  and come quietly?"    "Who on earth are you?" I exclaimed.
    I now remembered having seen the fellow hovering about during the  funeral, and subconsciously taking him for the undertaker's head man.
  He had certainly that appearance, and even now I could scarcely believe  that he was anything  else.
    "My name won't help you," he said, pityingly.
  "But you will guess  where I come from when I tell you I have a warrant for your arrest.
"    My sensations at this announcement may not be believed, but I solemnly  declare that I have seldom experienced so fierce a satisfaction.
  Here  was a new excitement in which to drown my grief; here was something to  think about; and I should be spared the intolerable experience of a  solitary return to the little place at Ham.
  It was as though I had  lost a limb and some one had struck me so hard in the face that the  greater agony was forgotten.
  I got into the hansom without a word, my  captor following at my heels, and giving his own directions to the  cabman before taking his seat.
  The word "station" was the only one I  caught, and I wondered whether it was to be Bow Street again.
  My  companion's next words, however, or rather the tone in which he uttered  them, destroyed my capacity for idle speculation.
    "Mr. Maturin!" said he.
  "Mr. Maturin indeed!"    "Well," said I, "what about him?"    "Do you think we don't know who he was?"    "Who was he?" I asked, defiantly.
    "You ought to know," said he.
  "You got locked up through him the other  time, too.
  His favorite name was Raffles then.
"    "It was his real name," I said, indignantly.
  "And he has been dead for  years.
"    My captor simply chuckled.
    "He's at the bottom of the sea, I tell you!"    But I do not know why I should have told him with such spirit, for what  could it matter to Raffles now?  I did not think; instinct was still  stronger than reason, and, fresh from his funeral,  I had taken up the  cudgels for my dead friend as though he were still alive.
  Next moment  I saw this for myself, and my tears came nearer the surface than they  had been yet; but the fellow at my side laughed outright.
    "Shall I tell you something else?" said he.
    "As you like.
"    "He's not even at the bottom of that grave!  He's no more dead than you  or I, and a sham burial is his latest piece of villainy!"    I doubt whether I could have spoken if I had tried.
  I did not try.
  I  had no use for speech.
  I  did not even ask him if he was sure, I was  so sure myself.
  It was all as plain to me as riddles usually are when  one has the answer.
  The doctor's alarms, his unscrupulous venality,  the simulated  illness, my own dismissal, each fitted in its obvious  place, and not even the last had power as yet to mar my joy in the one  central fact to which all the rest were as tapers to the sun.
    "He is alive!" I cried.
  "Nothing else matters--he is alive!"    At last I did ask whether they had got him  too; but thankful as I was  for the greater knowledge, I confess that I did not much care what  answer I received.
  Already I was figuring out how much we might each  get, and how old we should  be when we came out.
  But my companion  tilted his hat to the back of his head, at the same time putting his  face close to mine, and compelling my  scrutiny.
  And my answer, as you  have already guessed, was the face of Raffles himself, superbly  disguised (but less superbly than his voice), and yet so thinly that I  should have known him in a trice had I not been too miserable in the  beginning to give him a second glance.
    Jacques Saillard had made his life impossible, and this was the one  escape.
  Raffles had bought the doctor for a thousand pounds, and the  doctor had bought a "nurse" of his own kidney, on his own account; me,  for some reason, he would not trust; he had insisted upon my dismissal  as an essential preliminary to his part in the conspiracy.
  Here the  details were half-humorous, half-grewsome, each in turn as Raffles told  me the story.
  At one period he had been very daringly drugged indeed,  and, in his own words, "as dead as a man need be"; but he had left  strict instructions that nobody but the nurse and "my devoted  physician" should "lay a finger on me" afterwards; and by virtue of  this proviso a library of books (largely acquired for the occasion) had  been impiously interred at Kensal Green.
  Raffles had definitely  undertaken not to trust me with the secret, and, but for my untoward  appearance at the funeral (which he had attended for his own final  satisfaction), I was assured and am convinced that he would have kept  his promise to the letter.
  In explaining this he gave me the one  explanation I desired, and in another moment we turned into Praed  Street, Paddington.
    "And I thought you said Bow Street!" said I.
  "Are you coming straight  down to Richmond with me?"    "I may as well," said Raffles, "though I did mean to get my kit first,  so as to start in fair and  square as the long-lost brother from the  bush.
  That's why I hadn't written.
  The function was a  day later than  I calculated.
  I was going to write to-night.
"    "But what are we to do?" said I, hesitating when he had paid the cab.
  "I have been playing the colonies for all they are worth!"    "Oh, I've lost my luggage," said he, "or a wave came into my cabin and  spoilt every stitch, or I  had nothing fit to bring ashore.
  We'll  settle that in the train.
"        THE WRONG HOUSE    My brother Ralph, who now lived with me on the edge of Ham Common, had  come home from Australia with a curious affection of the eyes,  due to  long exposure to the glare out there, and necessitating the use of  clouded spectacles in the open air.
  He had not the rich complexion of  the typical colonist, being indeed peculiarly pale, but it appeared  that he had been confined to his berth for the greater part of the  voyage, while his prematurely gray hair was sufficient proof that the  rigors of bush life had at last undermined an originally tough  constitution.
  Our landlady, who spoilt my brother from the first, was  much concerned on his behalf, and wished to call in the local doctor;  but Ralph said dreadful things about the profession, and quite  frightened the good woman by arbitrarily forbidding her ever to let a  doctor inside her door.
  I had to apologize to her for the painful  prejudices and violent language of "these colonists," but the old soul  was easily mollified.
  She had fallen in love with my brother at first  sight, and she never could do too much for him.
  It was owing to our  landlady that I took to calling him Ralph, for the first time in our  lives, on her beginning to speak of and to him as "Mr. Raffles.
"    "This won't do," said he to me.
  "It's a name that sticks.
"    "It must be my fault!  She must have heard it from me," said I  self-reproachfully.
    "You must tell her it's the short for Ralph.
"    "But it's longer.
"    "It's the short," said he; "and you've got to tell her so.
"    Henceforth I heard as much of "Mr. Ralph," his likes and dislikes, what  he would fancy and what he would not, and oh, what a dear gentleman he  was, that I often remembered to say "Ralph, old chap," myself.
    It was an ideal cottage, as I said when I found it, and in it our  delicate man became rapidly  robust.
  Not that the air was also ideal,  for, when  it was not raining, we had the same faithful mist from  November to March.
  But it was something to Ralph to get any air at  all, other than  night-air, and the bicycle did the rest.
  We taught  ourselves, and may I never forget our earlier rides,  through and  through Richmond Park when the  afternoons were shortest, upon the  incomparable Ripley Road when we gave a day to it.
  Raffles  rode a  Beeston Humber, a Royal Sunbeam was good enough for me, but he insisted  on our both having Dunlop tires.
    "They seem the most popular brand.
  I had my eye on the road all the  way from Ripley to Cobham, and there were more Dunlop marks than any  other kind.
  Bless you, yes, they all leave their special tracks, and  we don't want ours to be extra special; the Dunlop's like a  rattlesnake, and the Palmer leaves telegraph-wires, but surely the  serpent is more in our line.
"    That was the winter when there were so many burglaries in the Thames  Valley from Richmond upward.
  It was said that the thieves used  bicycles in every case, but what is not said?  They were sometimes on  foot to my knowledge, and we took a great interest in the series, or  rather sequence of successful crimes.
  Raffles would often get his  devoted old lady to read him the latest local accounts, while I was  busy with my writing (much I  wrote) in my own room.
  We even rode out  by night ourselves, to see if we could not get on the tracks of the  thieves, and never did we fail to find hot coffee on the hob for our  return.
  We had indeed fallen upon our feet.
  Also, the misty nights  might have been made for the thieves.
  But their success was not so  consistent, and never so enormous as people said, especially the  sufferers, who lost more valuables than they had ever been known to  possess.
 Failure was often the caitiff's portion,  and disaster once;  owing, ironically enough, to that very mist which should have served  them.
  But as I am going to tell the story with some particularity, and  perhaps some gusto, you will see why who read.
    The right house stood on high ground near the river, with quite a drive  (in at one gate and out at the other) sweeping past the steps.
  Between  the  two gates was a half-moon of shrubs, to the left of the steps a  conservatory, and to their right the walk leading to the tradesmen's  entrance and the back premises; here also was the pantry window, of  which more anon.
  The right house was the  residence of an opulent  stockbroker who wore a heavy watch-chain and seemed fair game.
  There  would have been two objections to it had I been  the stockbroker.
  The  house was one of a row, though a goodly row, and an army-crammer had  established himself next door.
  There is a type of such institutions in  the suburbs; the youths go about in knickerbockers, smoking pipes,  except on Saturday nights, when they lead each other home from the last  train.
  It was none of our business to spy upon these boys, but their  manners and customs fell within the field of observation.
  And we did  not choose the night upon which the whole row was likely to be kept  awake.
    The night that we did choose was as misty as even the Thames Valley is  capable of making them.
  Raffles smeared vaseline upon the plated parts  of his Beeston Humber before starting, and our dear landlady cosseted  us both, and prayed we might see nothing of the nasty burglars, not  denying as the reward would be very handy to them that got it, to say  nothing of the honor and glory.
  We had promised her a liberal  perquisite  in the event of our success, but she must not give other  cyclists our idea by mentioning it to a soul.
  It was about midnight  when we cycled through  Kingston to Surbiton, having trundled our  machines across Ham Fields, mournful in the mist as those by Acheron,  and so over Teddington  Bridge.
    I often wonder why the pantry window is the  vulnerable point of nine  houses out of ten.
  This  house of ours was almost the tenth, for the  window  in question had bars of sorts, but not the right sort.
  The  only bars that Raffles allowed to beat him were the kind that are let  into the stone outside; those fixed within are merely screwed to the  woodwork, and you can unscrew as many as necessary if you take the  trouble and have the time.
  Barred windows are usually devoid of other  fasteners worthy the name; this one was no exception to that foolish  rule, and a push with the pen-knife did its business.
  I am giving  householders some valuable hints, and perhaps deserving a good mark  from the critics.
  These, in any case, are the points that I would see  to, were I a rich stockbroker in a riverside suburb.
  In giving good  advice, however, I should not have omitted to say that we had left our  machines in the semi-circular  shrubbery in front, or that Raffles had  most ingeniously fitted our lamps with dark slides, which  enabled us  to leave them burning.
    It proved sufficient to unscrew the bars at the bottom only, and then  to wrench them to either side.
  Neither of us had grown stout with  advancing years, and in a few minutes we both had wormed through into  the sink, and thence to the floor.
  It was not an absolutely noiseless  process, but once in the pantry we were mice, and no longer blind mice.
  There was a gas-bracket, but we did not meddle with that.
  Raffles went  armed these nights with a better light than gas; if it were not  immoral, I might recommend a dark-lantern which  was more or less his  patent.
  It was that handy invention, the electric torch, fitted by  Raffles with a  dark hood to fulfil the functions of a slide.
 I had  held it through the bars while he undid the screws,  and now he held it  to the keyhole, in which a key was turned upon the other side.
    There was a pause for consideration, and in the pause we put on our  masks.
  It was never known that these Thames Valley robberies were all  committed by miscreants decked in the livery of crime, but that was  because until this night we had never even shown our masks.
  It was a  point upon which  Raffles had insisted on all feasible occasions since  his furtive return to the world.
 To-night it twice nearly lost us  everything--but you shall hear.
    There is a forceps for turning keys from the wrong side of the door,  but the implement is not so easy of manipulation as it might be.
  Raffles for one preferred a sharp knife and the corner of  the panel.
  You go through the panel because that is thinnest, of course in the  corner nearest the key,  and you use a knife when you can, because it  makes least noise.
  But it does take minutes, and even I can remember  shifting the electric torch from one hand to the other before the  aperture was large enough to receive the hand and wrist of Raffles.
    He had at such times a motto of which I might have made earlier use,  but the fact is that I have only once before described a downright  burglary in which I assisted, and that without knowing it at the time.
  The most solemn student of these annals cannot affirm that he has cut  through many doors in our company, since (what was to me) the maiden  effort to which I allude.
  I, however, have cracked only too many a  crib in conjunction with A.
 J.
 Raffles, and at the crucial moment he  would whisper "Victory or Wormwood Scrubbs, Bunny!"  or instead of  Wormwood Scrubbs it might be  Portland Bill.
  This time it was neither  one nor the other, for with that very word "victory" upon his lips,  they whitened and parted with the first taste of defeat.
    "My hand's held!" gasped Raffles, and the white of his eyes showed all  round the iris, a rarer thing than you may think.
    At the same moment I heard the shuffling feet and the low, excited  young voices on the other side of the door, and a faint light shone  round Raffles's wrist.
    "Well done, Beefy!"    "Hang on to him!"    "Good old Beefy!"    "Beefy's got him!"    "So have I--so have I!"    And Raffles caught my arm with his one free hand.
  "They've got me  tight," he whispered.
  "I'm done.
"    "Blaze through the door," I urged, and might have done it had I been  armed.
  But I never was.
  It was Raffles who monopolized that risk.
    "I can't--it's the boys--the wrong house!" he  whispered.
  "Curse the  fog--it's done me.
  But you get out, Bunn, while you can; never mind  me; it's my turn, old chap.
"    His one hand tightened in affectionate farewell.
  I put the electric  torch in it before I went, trembling in every inch, but without a word.
    Get out!  His turn!  Yes, I would get out, but only to come in again,  for it was my turn--mine--not his.
  Would Raffles leave me held by a  hand through a hole in a door?  What he would have done in my place was  the thing for me to do now.
  I began by diving head-first through the  pantry window and coming to earth upon all fours.
  But even as I stood  up, and brushed the gravel from the palms of my hands and the knees of  my knickerbockers, I had no notion what to do next.
  And  yet I was  halfway to the front door before I remembered the vile crape mask upon  my face, and  tore it off as the door flew open and my feet were  on  the steps.
    "He's into the next garden," I cried to a bevy of pyjamas with bare  feet and young faces at either end of them.
    "Who?  Who?" said they, giving way before me.
    "Some fellow who came through one of your windows head-first.
"    "The other Johnny, the other Johnny," the cherubs chorused.
    "Biking past--saw the light--why, what have you there?"    Of course it was Raffles's hand that they had, but now I was in the  hall among them.
  A red-faced barrel of a boy did all the holding, one  hand round the wrist, the other palm to palm, and his knees braced up  against the panel.
  Another was rendering ostentatious but ineffectual  aid, and three or four others danced about in their pyjamas.
  After  all, they were not more than four to one.
  I had raised my voice, so  that Raffles might hear me and take heart, and now I raised it again.
  Yet to this day I cannot account for my inspiration, that proved  nothing less.
    "Don't talk so loud," they were crying below their breath; "don't wake  'em upstairs, this is our show.
"    "Then I see you've got one of them," said I, as desired.
  "Well, if you  want the other you can have him, too.
  I believe he's hurt himself.
"    "After him, after him!" they exclaimed as one.
    "But I think he got over the wall--"    "Come on, you chaps, come on!"    And there was a soft stampede to the hall door.
    "Don't all desert me, I say!" gasped the red-faced hero who held  Raffles prisoner.
    "We must have them both, Beefy!"    "That's all very well--"    "Look here," I interposed, "I'll stay by you.
  I've a friend outside,  I'll get him too.
"    "Thanks awfully," said the valiant Beefy.
    The hall was empty now.
  My heart beat high.
    "How did you hear them?" I inquired, my eye running over him.
    "We were down having drinks--game o' Nap--in there.
"    Beefy jerked his great head toward an open door, and the tail of my eye  caught the glint of  glasses in the firelight, but the rest of it was  otherwise engaged.
    "Let me relieve you," I said, trembling.
    "No, I'm all right.
"    "Then I must insist.
"    And before he could answer I had him round the neck with such a will  that not a gurgle passed my fingers, for they were almost buried in his  hot, smooth flesh.
  Oh, I am not proud of it; the act was as vile as  act could be; but I was not going to see Raffles taken, my one desire  was to be the saving of him, and I tremble even now to think to what  lengths I might have gone for its fulfilment.
  As it was, I squeezed  and tugged until one strong hand gave way after the other and came  feeling  round for me, but feebly because they had held on so long.
  And what do you suppose was happening at the same moment?  The pinched  white hand of Raffles, reddening with returning blood, and with a clot  of blood upon the wrist, was craning upward and turning the key in the  lock without a moment's loss.
    "Steady on, Bunny!"    And I saw that Beefy's ears were blue; but Raffles was feeling in his  pockets as he spoke.
  "Now let him breathe," said he, clapping his  handkerchief over the poor youth's mouth.
  An empty vial was in his  other hand, and the first few stertorous breaths that the poor boy took  were the end of him for the time being.
 Oh, but it was villainous, my  part especially, for he must have been far gone to go the rest of the  way so readily.
  I began by saying I was not proud of this deed, but  its dastardly character has come home to me more than ever with the  penance of writing it out.
  I see in myself, at least my then self,  things that I never saw quite so clearly before.
  Yet let me be  quite  sure that I would not do the same again.
  I  had not the smallest  desire to throttle this innocent lad (nor did I), but only to extricate  Raffles from the most hopeless position he was ever in; and after all  it was better than a blow from behind.
  On the whole, I will not alter  a word, nor whine about the thing any more.
    We lifted the plucky fellow into Raffles's place in the pantry, locked  the door on him, and put the key through the panel.
  Now was the moment  for thinking of ourselves, and again that infernal mask which Raffles  swore by came near the undoing of us both.
  We had reached the steps  when we were hailed by a voice, not from without but from within, and I  had just time to tear the accursed thing from Raffles's face before he  turned.
    A stout man with a blonde moustache was on the stairs, in his pyjamas  like the boys.
    "What are you doing here?" said he.
    "There has been an attempt upon your house,"  said I, still spokesman  for the night, and still on the wings of inspiration.
    "Your sons--"    "My pupils.
"    "Indeed.
  Well, they heard it, drove off the thieves, and have given  chase.
"    "And where do you come in?" inquired the stout man, descending.
    "We were bicycling past, and I actually saw one fellow come head-first  through your pantry window.
  I think he got over the wall.
"    Here a breathless boy returned.
    "Can't see anything of him," he gasped.
    "It's true, then," remarked the crammer.
    "Look at that door," said I.
    But unfortunately the breathless boy looked also, and now he was being  joined by others equally short of wind.
    "Where's Beefy?" he screamed.
  "What on earth's happened to Beefy?"    "My good boys," exclaimed the crammer,  "will one of you be kind enough  to tell me what you've been doing, and what these gentlemen have been  doing for you?  Come in all, before you get your death.
  I see lights  in the class-room, and  more than lights.
  Can these be signs of a  carouse?"    "A very innocent one, sir," said a well set-up youth with more  moustache than I have yet.
    "Well, Olphert, boys will be boys.
  Suppose you tell me what happened,  before we come to recriminations.
"    The bad old proverb was my first warning.
  I caught two of the youths  exchanging glances under raised eyebrows.
  Yet their stout, easy-going  mentor had given me such a reassuring glance of side-long humor, as  between man of the world and man of the world, that it was difficult to  suspect him of suspicion.
  I was nevertheless itching to be gone.
    Young Olphert told his story with engaging candor.
  It was true that  they had come down for an hour's Nap and cigarettes; well, and there  was no denying that there was whiskey in the glasses.
 The boys were now  all back in their class-room, I  think entirely for the sake of warmth;  but Raffles and I were in knickerbockers and Norfolk jackets, and very  naturally remained without, while the  army-crammer (who wore bedroom  slippers) stood on the threshold, with an eye each way.
  The more I saw  of the man the better I liked and the more I feared him.
  His chief  annoyance thus far was that they had not called him when they heard the  noise, that they had dreamt of leaving him out of the fun.
  But he  seemed more hurt than angry about that.
    "Well, sir," concluded Olphert, "we left old Beefy Smith hanging on to  his hand, and this gentleman with him, so perhaps he can tell us what  happened next?"    "I wish I could," I cried with all their eyes upon me, for I had had  time to think.
  "Some of you must have heard me say I'd fetch my friend  in from the road?"    "Yes, I did," piped an innocent from within.
    "Well, and when I came back with him things were exactly as you see  them now.
  Evidently the man's strength was too much for the boy's; but  whether he ran upstairs or outside I know no more than you do.
"    "It wasn't like that boy to run either way," said the crammer, cocking  a clear blue eye on me.
    "But if he gave chase!"    "It wasn't like him even to let go.
"    "I don't believe Beefy ever would," put in Olphert.
  "That's why we  gave him the billet.
"    "He may have followed him through the pantry window," I suggested  wildly.
    "But the door's shut," put in a boy.
    "I'll have a look at it," said the crammer.
    And the key no longer in the lock, and the insensible youth within!  The key would be missed,  the door kicked in; nay, with the man's eye  still upon me, I thought I could smell the chloroform.
    I thought I could hear a moan, and prepared for either any moment.
  And  how he did stare!  I  have detested blue eyes ever since, and blonde  moustaches, and the whole stout easy-going type that is not such a fool  as it looks.
  I had brazened it out with the boys, but the first grown  man was too many for me, and the blood ran out of my heart as though  there was no Raffles at my back.
  Indeed, I had forgotten him.
  I had  so longed to put this thing through by myself!  Even in my extremity it  was almost a disappointment to me when his dear, cool voice fell like a  delicious  draught upon my ears.
  But its effect upon the others is  more interesting to recall.
  Until now  the crammer had the centre of  the stage, but at this point Raffles usurped a place which was always  his at will.
  People would wait for what he had to say, as these people  waited now for the simplest and most natural thing in the world.
    "One moment!" he had begun.
    "Well?" said the crammer, relieving me of his eyes at last.
    "I don't want to lose any of the fun--"    "Nor must you," said the crammer, with emphasis.
    "But we've left our bikes outside, and mine's a Beeston Humber,"  continued Raffles.
  "If you don't mind, we'll bring 'em in before these  fellows get away on them.
"    And out he went without a look to see the effect of his words, I after  him with a determined imitation of his self-control.
  But I would have  given  something to turn round.
  I believe that for one  moment the  shrewd instructor was taken in, but as  I reached the steps I heard him  asking his pupils whether any of them had seen any bicycles outside.
    That moment, however, made the difference.
  We were in the shrubbery,  Raffles with his electric torch drawn and blazing, when we heard the  kicking at the pantry door, and in the drive with our bicycles before  man and boys poured pell-mell  down the steps.
    We rushed our machines to the nearer gate, for both were shut, and we  got through and swung it home behind us in the nick of time.
  Even I  could mount before they could reopen the gate, which Raffles held  against them for half an instant with unnecessary gallantry.
  But he  would see me in front of him, and so it fell to me to lead the way.
    Now, I have said that it was a very misty night (hence the whole  thing), and also that these houses were on a hill.
  But they were not  nearly on the top of the hill, and I did what I firmly believe that  almost everybody would have done in my place.
 Raffles, indeed, said he  would have done it himself, but that was his generosity, and he was the  one man who would not.
  What I did was to turn in the opposite  direction to the other gate, where we might so easily have been cut  off, and to pedal for my life--up-hill!    "My God!" I shouted when I found it out.
    "Can you turn in your own length?" asked Raffles, following loyally.
    "Not certain.
"    "Then stick to it.
  You couldn't help it.
  But it's the devil of a  hill!"    "And here they come!"    "Let them," said Raffles, and brandished his electric torch, our only  light as yet.
    A hill seems endless in the dark, for you cannot see the end, and with  the patter of bare feet gaining on us, I thought this one could have no  end at all.
  Of course the boys could charge up it quicker than we  could pedal, but I even heard the voice of their stout instructor  growing louder through the mist.
    "Oh, to think I've let you in for this!"  I groaned, my head over the  handle-bars, every ounce of my weight first on one foot and then on the  other.
  I glanced at Raffles, and in the white light of his torch he  was doing it all with his ankles, exactly as though he had been riding  in a Gymkhana.
    "It's the most sporting chase I was ever in,"  said he.
    "All my fault!"    "My dear Bunny, I wouldn't have missed it for the world!"    Nor would he forge ahead of me, though he could have done so in a  moment, he who from his  boyhood had done everything of the kind so  much  better than anybody else.
  No, he must ride a wheel's length  behind me, and now we could not only hear the boys running, but  breathing also.
  And then of a sudden I saw Raffles on my right  striking with his torch; a face flew out of the darkness to meet the  thick glass bulb with the glowing wire enclosed; it was the face of the  boy Olphert, with his enviable moustache, but it vanished with the  crash of glass, and the naked wire thickened to the eye like a  tuning-fork struck red-hot.
    I saw no more of that.
  One of them had crept up on my side also; as I  looked, hearing him pant, he was grabbing at my left handle, and I  nearly sent Raffles into the hedge by the sharp turn I took to the  right.
  His wheel's length saved him.
  But my boy could run, was  overhauling me again, seemed certain of me this time, when all at once  the Sunbeam ran easily; every ounce of my weight with either foot once  more, and I was over the crest of the hill, the gray road reeling out  from under me as I felt for my brake.
 I looked back at Raffles.
  He had  put up his feet.
  I screwed my head round still further, and there were  the boys in their pyjamas, their hands upon their knees, like  so many  wicket-keepers, and a big man shaking his fist.
  There was a lamp-post  on the hill-top, and that was the last I saw.
    We sailed down to the river, then on through Thames Ditton as far as  Esher Station, when we turned sharp to the right, and from the dark  stretch by Imber Court came to light in Molesey,  and were soon  pedalling like gentlemen of leisure through Bushey Park, our lights  turned up, the broken torch put out and away.
  The big gates had long  been shut, but you can manoeuvre a bicycle through the others.
  We had  no further adventures on the way home, and our coffee was still warm  upon the hob.
    "But I think it's an occasion for Sullivans," said Raffles, who now  kept them for such.
  "By all my  gods, Bunny, it's been the most  sporting night we ever had in our lives!  And do you know which was the  most sporting part of it?"    "That up-hill ride?"    "I wasn't thinking of it.
"    "Turning your torch into a truncheon?"    "My dear Bunny!  A gallant lad--I hated hitting him.
"    "I know," I said.
  "The way you got us out of the house!"    "No, Bunny," said Raffles, blowing rings.
  "It came before that, you  sinner, and you know it!"    "You don't mean anything I did?" said I, self-consciously, for I began  to see that this was what he did mean.
  And now at latest it will also  be  seen why this story has been told with undue and inexcusable gusto;  there is none other like it for me to tell; it is my one ewe-lamb in  all these annals.
  But Raffles had a ruder name for it.
    "It was the Apotheosis of the Bunny," said he, but in a tone I never  shall forget.
    "I hardly knew what I was doing or saying," I said.
  "The whole thing  was a fluke.
"    "Then," said Raffles, "it was the kind of fluke I always trusted you to  make when runs were wanted.
"    And he held out his dear old hand.
      THE KNEES OF THE GODS    I    "The worst of this war," said Raffles, "is the way it puts a fellow off  his work.
"    It was, of course, the winter before last, and we had done nothing  dreadful since the early autumn.
  Undoubtedly the war was the cause.
  Not that we were among the earlier victims of the fever.
  I took  disgracefully little interest in the Negotiations, while the Ultimatum  appealed to Raffles as a sporting flutter.
  Then we gave the  whole  thing till Christmas.
 We still missed the cricket in the papers.
  But  one russet afternoon  we were in Richmond, and a terrible type was  shouting himself hoarse with "'Eavy British  lorsses--orful slorter o'  the Bo-wers!  Orful slorter!  Orful slorter!  'Eavy British lorsses!"  I thought the terrible type had invented it, but Raffles gave him more  than he asked, and then I held the bicycle while he tried to pronounce  Eland's Laagte.
  We were never again without our sheaf of evening  papers, and Raffles ordered three morning ones, and I gave up mine in  spite  of its literary page.
 We became strategists.
  We  knew exactly  what Buller was to do on landing,  and, still better, what the other  Generals should  have done.
  Our map was the best that could be  bought, with flags that deserved a better fate than standing still.
  Raffles woke me to hear "The Absent-Minded Beggar" on the morning it  appeared; he was one of the first substantial subscribers to the fund.
  By this time our dear landlady was more excited than we.
  To our  enthusiasm for Thomas she added a personal bitterness against the Wild  Boars, as she persisted in calling them, each time as though it were  the first.
  I could linger over our landlady's attitude in the whole  matter.
  That was her only joke about it, and the  true humorist never  smiled at it herself.
  But you had only to say a syllable for a  venerable gentleman, declared by her to be at the bottom of it all,  to  hear what she could do to him if she caught him.
  She could put him in  a cage and go on tour with him, and make him howl and dance for his  food like a debased bear before a fresh audience every day.
  Yet a more  kind-hearted woman I have never known.
  The war did not uplift our  landlady as it did her lodgers.
    But presently it ceased to have that precise effect upon us.
  Bad was  being made worse and worse;  and then came more than Englishmen could  endure in that black week across which the names of  three African  villages are written forever in letters of blood.
  "All three pegs,"  groaned Raffles on the last morning of the week; "neck-and-crop,  neck-and-crop!"  It was his first word of cricket since the beginning  of the war.
    We were both depressed.
  Old school-fellows had fallen, and I know  Raffles envied them; he spoke so wistfully of such an end.
 To cheer him  up I proposed to break into one of the many more or less royal  residences in our neighborhood; a tough crib was what he needed; but I  will not trouble you with what he said to me.
 There was less crime in  England that winter than for years past; there was none at all in  Raffles.
  And yet there were those who could denounce the war!    So we went on for a few of those dark days,  Raffles very glum and  grim, till one fine morning the Yeomanry idea put new heart into us  all.
  It  struck me at once as the glorious scheme it was to  prove,  but it did not hit me where it hit others.
  I was not a fox-hunter, and  the gentlemen of England would scarcely have owned me as one of them.
  The case of Raffles was in that respect still more  hopeless (he who  had even played for them at Lord's), and he seemed to feel it.
  He  would not speak to me all the morning; in the afternoon he went for a  walk alone.
  It was another man who came home, flourishing a small  bottle packed in white paper.
    "Bunny," said he, "I never did lift my elbow; it's the one vice I never  had.
  It has taken me all these years to find my tipple, Bunny; but  here it is, my panacea, my elixir, my magic philtre!"    I thought he had been at it on the road, and asked him the name of the  stuff.
    "Look and see, Bunny.
"    And if it wasn't a bottle of ladies' hair-dye, warranted to change any  shade into the once fashionable yellow within a given number of  applications!    "What on earth," said I, "are you going to do with this?"    "Dye for my country," he cried, swelling.
  "Dulce et decorum est,  Bunny, my boy!"    "Do you mean that you are going to the front?"    "If I can without coming to it.
"    I looked at him as he stood in the firelight, straight as a dart, spare  but wiry, alert, laughing, flushed from his wintry walk; and as I  looked, all the years that I had known him, and more besides, slipped  from him in my eyes.
  I saw him captain of the eleven at school.
  I saw  him running with the muddy ball on days like this, running round the  other fifteen as a sheep-dog round a flock of sheep.
  He had his cap on  still, and but for the  gray hairs underneath--but here I lost him in a  sudden mist.
  It was not sorrow at his going, for I did not mean to let  him go alone.
 It was enthusiasm, admiration, affection, and also, I  believe, a sudden regret that he had not always appealed to that part  of my nature to which he was appealing now.
  It was a little thrill of  penitence.
  Enough  of it.
    "I think it great of you," I said, and at first that was all.
    How he laughed at me.
  He had had his innings; there was no better way  of getting out.
  He had scored off an African millionaire, the Players,  a Queensland Legislator, the Camorra, the late Lord Ernest Belville,  and again and again off Scotland Yard.
  What more could one man do in  one lifetime?  And at the worst it was the death to die: no bed, no  doctor, no temperature--and Raffles stopped himself.
    "No pinioning, no white cap," he added, "if you like that better.
"    "I don't like any of it," I cried, cordially; "you've simply got to  come back.
"    "To what?" he asked, a strange look on him.
    And I wondered--for one instant--whether my little thrill had gone  through him.
  He was not a man of little thrills.
    Then for a minute I was in misery.
  Of course I wanted to go too--he  shook my hand without a word--but how could I?  They would never  have  me, a branded jailbird, in the Imperial Yeomanry!  Raffles burst out  laughing; he had been looking very hard at me for about three seconds.
    "You rabbit," he cried, "even to think of it!  We might as well offer  ourselves to the Metropolitan Police Force.
  No, Bunny, we go out to  the Cape on our own, and that's where we enlist.
  One of these  regiments of irregular horse is the thing for us; you spent part of  your pretty penny on horse-flesh, I believe, and you remember how  I  rode in the bush!  We're the very men for them, Bunny, and they won't  ask to see our birthmarks out there.
 I don't think even my hoary locks  would put them off, but it would be too conspicuous in the ranks.
"    Our landlady first wept on hearing our determination, and then longed  to have the pulling of certain whiskers (with the tongs, and they  should be red-hot); but from that day, and for as many as were left to  us, the good soul made more of us than ever.
  Not that she was at all  surprised; dear brave gentlemen who could look for burglars on their  bicycles at dead of night, it was only what  you might expect of them,  bless their lion hearts.
  I wanted to wink at Raffles, but he would not  catch my eye.
  He was a ginger-headed Raffles by the end of January,  and it was extraordinary what a difference it made.
  His most elaborate  disguises had not been more effectual than this simple expedient, and,  with khaki to complete the subdual of his individuality, he had every  hope of escaping recognition in the field.
  The man he dreaded was the  officer he had known in old days; there were ever so many of him at the  Front; and it was to minimize this risk that we went out second-class  at the beginning of February.
    It was a weeping day, a day in a shroud, cold as clay, yet for that  very reason an ideal day upon which to leave England for the sunny  Front.
  Yet my heart was heavy as I looked my last at her; it was heavy  as the raw, thick air, until Raffles came and leant upon the rail at my  side.
    "I know what you are thinking, and you've got to stop," said he.
 "It's  on the knees of the gods,  Bunny, whether we do or we don't, and  thinking won't make us see over their shoulders.
"      II    Now I made as bad a soldier (except at heart) as Raffles made a good  one, and I could not say a harder thing of myself.
  My ignorance of  matters military was up to that time unfathomable, and is still  profound.
  I was always a fool with horses, though I did not think so  at one time, and I had  never been any good with a gun.
  The average  Tommy may be my intellectual inferior, but he must know some part of  his work better than I ever knew any of mine.
  I never even learnt to  be killed.
  I do not mean that I ever ran away.
  The South African  Field Force might have been strengthened if I had.
    The foregoing remarks do not express a pose affected out of superiority  to the usual spirit of the conquering hero, for no man was keener on  the war than I, before I went to it.
  But one can only write with gusto  of events (like that little affair at Surbiton) in which one has  acquitted oneself without discredit, and I cannot say that of my part  in the war, of which I now loathe the thought for other reasons.
  The  battlefield was no place for me, and neither was the camp.
  My  ineptitude made me the butt of the looting, cursing, swash-buckling lot  who formed the very irregular squadron which we joined; and it would  have gone hard with me but for Raffles, who was soon the darling devil  of them all, but never more loyally my friend.
  Your fireside  fire-eater does not think of these  things.
  He imagines all the  fighting to be with the enemy.
  He will probably be horrified to hear  that men can detest each other as cordially in khaki as in any other  wear, and with a virulence seldom inspired by the bearded dead-shot in  the opposite trench.
  To the fireside fire-eater, therefore (for you  have seen me one myself), I dedicate the story of Corporal Connal,  Captain Bellingham, the General, Raffles, and myself.
    I must be vague, for obvious reasons.
  The troop is fighting as I  write; you will soon hear why I am not; but neither is Raffles, nor  Corporal Connal.
  They are fighting as well as ever, those other  hard-living, harder-dying sons of all soils; but I am not going to say  where it was that we fought with them.
  I believe that no body of men  of equal size has done half so much heroic work.
  But they had got  themselves a bad name off the field, so to speak; and I am not going to  make it worse by saddling them before the world with Raffles and  myself, and that ruffian Connal.
    The fellow was a mongrel type, a Glasgow Irishman by birth and  upbringing, but he had been  in South Africa for years, and he  certainly knew the country very well.
  This circumstance, coupled with  the fact that he was a very handy man with horses, as all colonists  are, had procured him the first small step from the ranks which  facilitates bullying if a man be a bully by nature, and is physically  fitted to be a successful one.
  Connal was a hulking ruffian, and in me  had ideal game.
  The  brute was offensive to me from the hour I joined.
  The details are of no importance, but I stood up to him at first in  words, and finally for a few seconds on my feet.
  Then I went down like  an ox, and Raffles came out of his tent.
  Their fight lasted twenty  minutes, and Raffles was marked, but the net result was dreadfully  conventional, for the  bully was a bully no more.
    But I began gradually to suspect that he was something worse.
 All this  time we were fighting  every day, or so it seems when I look back.
  Never a great engagement, and yet never a day when we were wholly out  of touch with the enemy.
  I had thus several opportunities of watching  the other enemy under fire, and had almost convinced myself of the  systematic harmlessness of his own shooting, when a more glaring  incident occurred.
    One night three troops of our squadron were ordered to a certain point  whither they had patrolled the previous week; but our own particular  troop was to stay behind, and in charge of no other than the villanous  corporal, both our officer and sergeant having gone into hospital with  enteric.
  Our detention, however, was very temporary, and Connal would  seem to have received the usual vague orders to proceed in the early  morning to the place where the other three companies had camped.
  It  appeared that we were to form an escort to two squadron-wagons  containing kits, provisions, and ammunition.
    Before daylight Connal had reported his departure to the commanding  officer, and we passed the outposts at gray dawn.
 Now, though I was  perhaps the least observant person in the troop, I was not the least  wideawake where Corporal Connal was concerned, and it struck me at once  that we were heading in the wrong direction.
  My reasons are not  material, but as a matter of fact our last week's patrol had pushed its  khaki tentacles both east and west; and eastward they had met with  resistance so determined as to compel them to retire; yet it was  eastward that we were travelling now.
  I at once spurred alongside  Raffles, as he rode, bronzed and bearded, with warworn wide-awake over  eyes grown keen as a hawk's, and a cutty-pipe sticking straight out  from his front teeth.
  I can see him now, so gaunt and grim and  debonair, yet already with much of the nonsense gone out of him, though  I thought he only smiled on my misgivings.
    "Did he get the instructions, Bunny, or did we?  Very well, then; give  the devil a chance.
"    There was nothing further to be said, but I felt more crushed than  convinced; so we jogged along into broad daylight, until Raffles  himself gave a whistle of surprise.
    "A white flag, Bunny, by all my gods!"    I could not see it; he had the longest sight in all our squadron; but  in a little the fluttering emblem, which had gained such a sinister  significance in most of our eyes, was patent even to mine.
  A little  longer, and the shaggy Boer was in our midst upon his shaggy pony, with  a half-scared, half-incredulous look in his deep-set eyes.
  He was on  his way to our lines with some missive, and had little enough to say to  us, though frivolous and flippant questions were showered upon him from  most saddles.
    "Any Boers over there?" asked one, pointing in the direction in which  we were still heading.
    "Shut up!" interjected Raffles in crisp rebuke.
    The Boer looked stolid but sinister.
    "Any of our chaps?" added another.
    The Boer rode on with an open grin.
    And the incredible conclusion of the matter was that we were actually  within their lines in another hour; saw them as large as life within a  mile and a half on either side of us; and must every man of us have  been taken prisoner had not every man but Connal refused to go one inch  further, and had not the Boers themselves obviously suspected some  subtle ruse as the only conceivable explanation of so madcap a  manoeuvre.
  They allowed us to retire  without firing a shot; and  retire you may be sure we did, the Kaffirs flogging their teams in a  fury of fear, and our precious corporal sullen but defiant.
    I have said this was the conclusion of the matter, and I blush to  repeat that it practically was.
  Connal was indeed wheeled up before  the colonel, but his instructions were not written instructions, and he  lied his way out with equal hardihood and tact.
    "You said 'over there,' sir," he stoutly reiterated; and the vagueness  with which such orders were undoubtedly given was the saving of him for  the time being.
    I need not tell you how indignant I felt, for one.
    "The fellow is a spy!" I said to Raffles, with no nursery oath, as we  strolled within the lines that night.
    He merely smiled in my face.
    "And have you only just found it out, Bunny?  I have known it almost  ever since we joined; but this morning I did think we had him on toast.
"    "It's disgraceful that we had not," cried I.
  "He ought to have been  shot like a dog.
"    "Not so loud, Bunny, though I quite agree; but I don't regret what has  happened as much as you do.
  Not that I am less bloodthirsty than you  are in this case, but a good deal more so! Bunny, I'm  mad-keen on  bowling him out with my own unaided hand--though I may ask you to take  the wicket.
  Meanwhile, don't wear all your animosity upon your sleeve;  the fellow has friends who still believe in him; and there is no need  for you to be more openly his enemy than you were before.
"    Well, I can only vow that I did my best to follow this sound advice;  but who but a Raffles can control his every look?  It was never my  forte, as you  know, yet to this day I cannot conceive what I did to  excite the treacherous corporal's suspicions.
  He was clever enough,  however, not to betray them, and lucky enough to turn the tables on us,  as you shall hear.
      III    Bloemfontein had fallen since our arrival, but there was plenty of  fight in the Free Staters still, and I will not deny that it was these  gentry who were showing us the sport for which our corps came in.
  Constant skirmishing was our portion, with now and then an action that  you would know at least by name, did I feel free to mention them.
  But  I do not, and indeed it is better so.
  I have not to describe the war  even as I saw it, I am thankful to say, but only the martial story of  us two and those others of whom you wot.
  Corporal Connal was the  dangerous blackguard you have seen.
  Captain Bellingham is best known  for his position in the batting averages a year or two ago, and for his  subsequent failure to obtain a place in any of the five Test Matches.
  But I only think of him as the officer who recognized Raffles.
    We had taken a village, making quite a little name for it and for  ourselves, and in the village our division was reinforced by a fresh  brigade of the Imperial troops.
  It was a day of rest, our first for  weeks, but Raffles and I spent no small part of it in seeking high and  low for a worthy means of quenching the kind of thirst which used to  beset Yeomen and others who had left good cellars for the veldt.
  The  old knack came back to us both, though I believe that I alone was  conscious of it at the time; and we were leaving the house, splendidly  supplied, when we almost ran into the arms of an infantry officer, with  a scowl upon his red-hot face, and an eye-glass flaming at us in the  sun.
    "Peter Bellingham!" gasped Raffles under his  breath, and then we  saluted and tried to pass on, with the bottles ringing like  church-bells under our  khaki.
  But Captain Bellingham was a hard man.
    "What have you men been doin'?" drawled he.
    "Nothing, sir," we protested, like innocence with an injury.
    "Lootin' 's forbidden," said he.
  "You had better let me see those  bottles.
"    "We are done," whispered Raffles, and straightway we made a sideboard  of the stoop across which he had crept at so inopportune a moment.
  I  had not the heart to raise my eyes again, yet it was many moments  before the officer broke silence.
    "Uam Var!" he murmured reverentially at last.
  "And Long John of Ben  Nevis!  The first drop that's been discovered in the whole  psalm-singing show!  What lot do you two belong to?"    I answered.
    "I must have your names.
"    In my agitation I gave my real one.
  Raffles had turned away, as though  in heart-broken contemplation of our lost loot.
  I saw the officer  studying his half-profile with an alarming face.
    "What's YOUR name?" he rapped out at last.
    But his strange, low voice said plainly that he knew, and Raffles faced  him with the monosyllable of confession and assent.
  I did not count  the seconds until the next word, but it was Captain Bellingham who  uttered it at last.
    "I thought you were dead.
"    "Now you see I am not.
"    "But you are at your old games!"    "I am not," cried Raffles, and his tone was new to me.
  I have seldom  heard one more indignant.
  "Yes," he continued, "this is loot, and the  wrong  'un will out.
  That's what you're thinking, Peter--I beg your  pardon--sir.
  But he isn't let out in the field!  We're playing the  game as much as you are, old--sir.
"    The plural number caused the captain to toss me a contemptuous look.
  "Is this the fellah who was taken when you swam for it?" he inquired,  relapsing into his drawl.
  Raffles said I was, and with that took a  passionate oath upon our absolute rectitude as volunteers.
  There could  be no doubting him; but the officer's eyes went back at the bottles on  the stoop.
    "But look at those," said he; and as he looked himself the light eye  melted in his fiery face.
  "And I've got Sparklets in my tent," he  sighed.
  "You make it in a minute!"    Not a word from Raffles, and none, you may be sure, from me.
 Then  suddenly Bellingham told  me where his tent was, and, adding that our  case  was one for serious consideration, strode in its direction  without another word until some sunlit paces separated us.
    "You can bring that stuff with you," he then flung over a  shoulder-strap, "and I advise you to  put it where you had it before.
"    A trooper saluted him some yards further on, and looked evilly at us as  we followed with our loot.
  It was Corporal Connal of ours, and the  thought of him takes my mind off the certainly gallant captain who only  that day had joined our division with the reinforcements.
  I could not  stand the man myself.
  He added soda-water to our whiskey in his tent,  and would only keep a couple of bottles when we came away.
  Softened by  the spirit, to which disuse made us all a little sensitive, our officer  was soon convinced of the honest part that we were playing for once,  and for fifty minutes of the hour we spent with him he and Raffles  talked cricket without a break.
  On parting they even shook hands; that  was Long John in the captain's head; but the snob never addressed a  syllable to me.
    And now to the gallows-bird who was still corporal of our troop: it was  not long before Raffles was to have his wish and the traitor's wicket.
  We had resumed our advance, or rather our humble part in the great  surrounding movement then taking place, and were under pretty heavy  fire once more, when Connal was shot in the hand.
  It was a curious  casualty in more than one respect, and nobody seems to have seen it  happen.
  Though a flesh wound, it was a bloody one, and that may be why  the surgeon did not at once detect those features which afterwards  convinced him that the injury had been self-inflicted.
  It was the  right hand, and until it healed the man could be of no further use in  the firing line; nor was the case serious enough for admission to a  crowded field-hospital; and Connal himself offered his services as  custodian of a number of our horses which we were keeping out of harm's  way in a donga.
  They had come there in the following manner: That  morning we had been heliographed to reinforce the C.
M.
R.
, only to find  that the enemy had the range to a nicety when we reached the spot.
  There were trenches for us men, but no place of safety for our horses  nearer than this long and narrow donga which ran from within our lines  towards those of the Boers.
  So some of us galloped them thither,  six-in-hand, amid the whine of shrapnel and the whistle of shot.
 I  remember the man next me being killed by a shell with all his team, and  the tangle of flying harness, torn horseflesh, and crimson khaki, that  we left behind us on the veldt; also that a small red  flag,  ludicrously like those used to indicate a putting-green, marked the  single sloping entrance to the otherwise precipitous donga, which I for  one was duly thankful to reach alive.
    The same evening Connal, with a few other light casualties to assist  him, took over the charge for which he had volunteered and for which he  was so admirably fitted by his knowledge of horses and his general  experience of the country; nevertheless, he managed to lose three or  four fine chargers in the course of the first night; and, early in the  second, Raffles shook me out of a heavy slumber in the trenches where  we had been firing all day.
    "I have found the spot, Bunny," he whispered; "we ought to out him  before the night is over.
"    "Connal?"    Raffles nodded.
    "You know what happened to some of his horses last night?  Well, he let  them go himself.
"    "Never!"    "I'm as certain of it," said Raffles, "as though I'd seen him do it;  and if he does it again I shall see him.
  I can even tell you how it  happened.
  Connal insisted on having one end of the donga to  himself,  and of course his end is the one nearest the Boers.
 Well, then, he  tells the other fellows to go to sleep at their end--I have it direct  from one of them--and you bet they don't need a second invitation.
  The  rest I hope to see to-night.
"    "It seems almost incredible," said I.
    "Not more so than the Light Horseman's dodge of poisoning the troughs;  that happened at Ladysmith before Christmas; and two kind friends did  for that blackguard what you and I are going to do for this one, and a  firing-party did the rest.
  Brutes!  A mounted man's worth a file on  foot in  this country, and well they know it.
  But this  beauty goes  one better than the poison; that was  wilful waste; but I'll eat my  wideawake if our loss last night wasn't the enemy's double gain!  What  we've got to do, Bunny, is to catch him in the act.
  It may mean  watching him all night, but was ever game so well worth the candle?"    One may say in passing that, at this particular point of contact, the  enemy were in superior force, and for once in a mood as aggressive as  our own.
  They were led with a dash, and handled with a skill, which  did not always characterize their commanders at this stage of the war.
  Their position  was very similar to ours, and indeed we were to spend  the whole of next day in trying with an  equal will to turn each other  out.
  The result will scarcely be forgotten by those who recognize the  occasion from these remarks.
  Meanwhile it was  the eve of battle (most  evenings were), and there  was that villain with the horses in the  donga, and here were we two upon his track.
    Raffles's plan was to reconnoitre the place, and then take up a  position from which we could watch our man and pounce upon him if he  gave us cause.
  The spot that we eventually chose and stealthily  occupied was behind some bushes through which we could see down into  the donga; there were the precious horses; and there sure enough was  our wounded corporal, sitting smoking in his cloak, some glimmering  thing in his lap.
    "That's his revolver, and it's a Mauser," whispered Raffles.
  "He  shan't have a chance of using it on us; either we must be on him before  he knows we are anywhere near, or simply report.
  It's easily proved  once we are sure; but I should like to have the taking of him too.
"    There was a setting moon.
  Shadows were sharp and black.
  The man  smoked steadily, and the hungry horses did what I never saw horses do  before; they stood and nibbled at each other's tails.
 I was used to  sleeping in the open, under the  jewelled dome that seems so much  vaster and  grander in these wide spaces of the earth.
  I lay listening  to the horses, and to the myriad small strange voices of the veldt, to  which I cannot even now put a name, while Raffles watched.
  "One  head  is better than two," he said, "when you don't want it to be seen.
"  We  were to take watch and watch about, however, and the other might sleep  if he could; it was not my fault that I did nothing else; it was  Raffles who could trust nobody but himself.
  Nor was there any time for  recriminations when he did rouse me in the end.
    But a moment ago, as it seemed to me, I had been gazing upward at the  stars and listening to the dear, minute sounds of peace; and in another  the great gray slate was clean, and every bone of me set in plaster of  Paris, and sniping beginning between pickets with the day.
  It was an  occasional crack, not a constant crackle, but the whistle of a  bullet  as it passed us by, or a tiny transitory flame for the one bit of  detail on a blue hill-side, was an unpleasant warning that we two on  ours were a target in ourselves.
  But Raffles paid no attention to  their fire; he was pointing downward through the bushes to where  Corporal Connal stood with his back to us, shooing a last charger out  of the mouth of the donga towards the Boer trenches.
    "That's his third," whispered Raffles, "but it's the first I've seen  distinctly, for he waited for the blind spot before the dawn.
  It's  enough to land him, I fancy, but we mustn't lose time.
  Are you ready  for a creep?"    I stretched myself, and said I was; but I devoutly wished it was not  quite so early in the  morning.
    "Like cats, then, till he hears, and then into him for all we're worth.
  He's stowed his iron safe away, but he mustn't have time even to feel  for it.
  You take his left arm, Bunny, and hang on to that like a  ferret, and I'll do the rest.
  Ready?  Then  now!"    And in less time than it would take to tell, we were over the lip of  the donga and had fallen upon the fellow before he could turn his head;  nevertheless, for a few instants he fought like a wild beast, striking,  kicking, and swinging me off my feet as I obeyed my instructions to the  letter, and stuck to his left like a leech.
  But he soon gave that up,  panting and blaspheming, demanded explanations in his hybrid tongue  that had half a brogue and  half a burr.
  What were we doing?  What had  he done? Raffles at his back, with his right wrist twisted round and  pinned into the small of it, soon told him that, and I think the words  must have been the first intimation that he had as to who his  assailants were.
    "So it's you two!" he cried, and a light broke over him.
  He was no  longer trying to shake us off, and now he dropped his curses also, and  stood chuckling to himself instead.
  "Well," he went on, "you're bloody  liars both, but I know something else that you are, so you'd better let  go.
"    A coldness ran through me, and I never saw  Raffles so taken aback.
  His grip must have relaxed for a fraction of time, for our captive  broke out in a fresh and desperate struggle, but now we pinned him  tighter than ever, and soon I saw him turning green and yellow with the  pain.
    "You're breaking my wrist!" he yelled at last.
    "Then stand still and tell us who we are.
"    And he stood still and told us our real names.
  But Raffles insisted on  hearing how he had found us out, and smiled as though he had known what  was coming when it came.
  I was dumbfounded.
    The accursed hound had followed us that evening to Captain Bellingham's  tent, and his undoubted cleverness in his own profession of spy had  done  the rest.
    "And now you'd better let me go," said the master of the situation, as  I for one could not help  regarding him.
    "I'll see you damned," said Raffles, savagely.
    "Then you're damned and done for yourself, my cocky criminal.
 Raffles  the burglar!  Raffles  the society thief!  Not dead after all, but  'live and  'listed.
  Send him home and give him fourteen years, and  won't he like 'em, that's all!"    "I shall have the pleasure of hearing you shot first," retorted  Raffles, through his teeth, "and  that alone will make them bearable.
  Come on, Bunny, let's drive the swine along and get it over.
"    And drive him we did, he cursing, cajoling, struggling, gloating, and  blubbering by turns.
  But Raffles never wavered for an instant, though  his face was tragic, and it went to my heart, where that look stays  still.
  I remember at the time, though I never let my hold relax, there  was a moment when I added my entreaties to those of our prisoner.
  Raffles did not even reply to me.
  But I was thinking of him, I swear.
  I was thinking of that gray set face that I never saw before or after.
    "Your story will be tested," said the commanding officer, when Connal  had been marched to the guard-tent.
  "Is there any truth in his?"    "It is perfectly true, sir.
"    "And the notorious Raffles has been alive all these years, and you are  really he?"    "I am, sir.
"    "And what are you doing at the front?"    Somehow I thought that Raffles was going to smile, but the grim set of  his mouth never altered, neither was there any change in the ashy  pallor which had come over him in the donga when Connal mouthed his  name.
  It was only his eyes that lighted up at the last question.
    "I am fighting, sir," said he, as simply as any subaltern in the army.
    The commanding officer inclined a grizzled head perceptibly, and no  more.
  He was not one of any school, our General; he had his own ways,  and we loved both him and them; and I believe that he loved the rough  but gallant corps that bore his name.
  He once told us that he knew  something about most of us, and there were things that Raffles had done  of which he must have heard.
  But he only moved his grizzled head.
    "Did you know he was going to give you away?"  he asked at length, with  a jerk of it toward the guard-tent.
    "Yes, sir.
"    "But you thought it worth while, did you?"    "I thought it necessary, sir.
"    The General paused, drumming on his table, making up his mind.
 Then his  chin came up with the decision that we loved in him.
    "I shall sift all this," said he.
  "An officer's name was mentioned,  and I shall see him myself.
  Meanwhile you had better go on--fighting.
"      IV    Corporal Connal paid the penalty of his crime before the sun was far  above the hill held by the enemy.
  There was abundance of  circumstantial evidence against him, besides the direct testimony of  Raffles and myself, and the wretch was shot at last with little  ceremony and less shrift.
  And that was the one good thing that  happened on the day that broke upon us hiding behind the bushes  overlooking the donga; by noon it was my own turn.
    I have avoided speaking of my wound before I need, and from the  preceding pages you would not gather that I am more or less lame for  life.
  You will soon see now why I was in no hurry to recall the  incident.
  I used to think of a wound received in one's country's  service as the proudest trophy a man could acquire.
 But the sight of  mine depresses me every morning of my life; it was due for one thing to  my own slow eye for cover, in taking which (to aggravate my case) our  hardy little corps happened to excel.
    The bullet went clean through my thigh, drilling the bone, but happily  missing the sciatic nerve; thus the mere pain was less than it might  have been, but of course I went over in a light-brown heap.
  We were  advancing on our stomachs to take the hill, and thus extend our  position, and it was at this point that the fire became too heavy for  us, so  that for hours (in the event) we moved neither  forward nor  back.
  But it was not a minute before Raffles came to me through the  whistling scud, and in another I was on my back behind a shallow rock,  with him kneeling over me and unrolling my  bandage in the teeth of  that murderous fire.
  It was on the knees of the gods, he said, when I  begged him to bend lower, but for the moment I thought his tone as  changed as his face had been earlier in the morning.
  To oblige me,  however, he took more care; and, when he had done all that one comrade  could for another, he did avail himself of the cover he had found for  me.
  So there  we lay together on the veldt, under blinding sun and  withering fire, and I suppose it is the veldt that I should describe,  as it swims and flickers before wounded eyes.
  I shut mine to bring it  back, but all that comes is the keen brown face of Raffles, still a  shade paler than its wont; now bending to sight and fire; now peering  to see results, brows raised, eyes widened; anon turning to me with the  word to set my tight lips grinning.
  He  was talking all the time, but  for my sake, and I knew it.
  Can you wonder that I could not see an  inch beyond him?  He was the battle to me then; he is the whole war to  me as I look back  now.
    "Feel equal to a cigarette?  It will buck you up, Bunny.
  No, that one  in the silver paper, I've hoarded it for this.
  Here's a light; and so  Bunny takes the Sullivan!  All honor to the sporting  rabbit!"    "At least I went over like one," said I, sending the only clouds into  the blue, and chiefly wishing  for their longer endurance.
 I was as hot  as a cinder from my head to one foot; the other leg was ceasing to  belong to me.
    "Wait a bit," says Raffles, puckering; "there's a gray felt hat at deep  long-on, and I want to add  it to the bag for vengeance.
.
.
.
  Wait--yes--no, no luck!  I must pitch 'em up a bit more.
 Hallo!  Magazine empty.
  How goes the Sullivan, Bunny?  Rum to be smoking one  on the veldt with a hole in your leg!"    "It's doing me good," I said, and I believe it was.
  But Raffles lay  looking at me as he lightened his bandolier.
    "Do you remember," he said softly, "the day we first began to think  about the war?  I can see the pink, misty river light, and feel the  first bite there was in the air when one stood about; don't you wish we  had either here!  'Orful slorter, orful slorter;' that fellow's face, I  see it too; and here we have the thing he cried.
  Can you believe it's  only six months ago?"    "Yes," I sighed, enjoying the thought of that afternoon less than he  did; "yes, we were slow to catch fire at first.
"    "Too slow," he said quickly.
    "But when we did catch," I went on, wishing we never had, "we soon  burnt up.
"    "And then went out," laughed Raffles gayly.
  He was loaded up again.
  "Another over at the  gray felt hat," said he; "by Jove, though, I  believe he's having an over at me!"    "I wish you'd be careful," I urged.
  "I heard it too.
"    "My dear Bunny, it's on the knees you wot of.
  If anything's down in  the specifications surely that is.
  Besides--that was nearer!"    "To you?"    "No, to him.
  Poor devil, he has his specifications too; it's  comforting to think that.
.
.
.
  I can't see where that one pitched; it  may have been a wide; and it's very nearly the end of the over again.
  Feeling worse, Bunny?"    "No, I've only closed my eyes.
  Go on talking.
"    "It was I who let you in for this," he said, at his bandolier again.
    "No, I'm glad I came out.
"    And I believe I still was, in a way; for it WAS rather fine to be  wounded, just then, with the pain growing less; but the sensation was  not to last me  many minutes, and I can truthfully say that I have  never felt it since.
    "Ah, but you haven't had such a good time as I  have!"    "Perhaps not.
"    Had his voice vibrated, or had I imagined it?  Pain-waves and loss of  blood were playing tricks with my senses; now they were quite dull, and  my leg alive and throbbing; now I had no leg at all, but more than all  my ordinary senses in every other part of me.
  And the devil's  orchestra was  playing all the time, and all around me, on every class  of fiendish instrument, which you have been made to hear for yourselves  in every newspaper.
  Yet all that I heard was Raffles talking.
    "I have had a good time, Bunny.
"    Yes, his voice was sad; but that was all; the vibration must have been  in me.
    "I know you have, old chap," said I.
    "I am grateful to the General for giving me to-day.
  It may be the  last.
  Then I can only say it's been the best--by Jove!"    "What is it?"    And I opened my eyes.
  His were shining.
  I can see them now.
    "Got him--got the hat!  No, I'm hanged if I have; at least he wasn't in  it.
  The crafty cuss, he must have stuck it up on purpose.
  Another  over .
.
.
 scoring's slow.
.
.
.
  I wonder if he's sportsman enough to take  a hint?  His hat-trick's foolish.
 Will he show his face if I show mine?"    I lay with closed ears and eyes.
  My leg had come to life again, and  the rest of me was numb.
    "Bunny!"    His voice sounded higher.
  He must have been sitting upright.
    "Well?"    But it was not well with me; that was all I thought as my lips made the  word.
    "It's not only been the best time I ever had, old Bunny, but I'm not  half sure--"    Of what I can but guess; the sentence was not finished, and never could  be in this world.

  The scene of my disaster was much as I had left it.
  The baccarat-counters still strewed the table, with the empty glasses  and the loaded ash-trays.
  A window had been opened to let the smoke  out, and was letting in the fog instead.
  Raffles himself had merely  discarded his dining jacket for one of his innumerable blazers.
  Yet he  arched his eyebrows as though I had dragged him from his bed.
    "Forgotten something?" said he, when he saw me on his mat.
    "No," said I, pushing past him without ceremony.
  And I led the way  into his room with an impudence amazing to myself.
    "Not come back for your revenge, have you?  Because I'm afraid I can't  give it to you single-handed.
  I was sorry myself that the others--"    We were face to face by his fireside, and I cut him short.
    "Raffles," said I, "you may well be surprised at my coming back in this  way and at this hour.
  I hardly know you.
  I was never in your rooms  before to-night.
  But I fagged for you at school, and you said you  remembered me.
  Of course that's no excuse; but will you listen to  me--for two minutes?"    In my emotion I had at first to struggle for every word; but his face  reassured me as I went on, and I was not mistaken in its expression.
    "Certainly, my dear man," said he; "as many minutes as you like.
  Have  a Sullivan and sit down.
"  And he handed me his silver cigarette-case.
    "No," said I, finding a full voice as I shook my head; "no, I won't  smoke, and I won't sit down, thank you.
  Nor will you ask me to do  either when you've heard what I have to say.
"    "Really?" said he, lighting his own cigarette with one clear blue eye  upon me.
  "How do you know?"    "Because you'll probably show me the door," I cried bitterly; "and you  will be justified in doing it!  But it's no use beating about the bush.
  You know I dropped over two hundred just now?"    He nodded.
    "I hadn't the money in my pocket.
"    "I remember.
"    "But I had my check-book, and I wrote each of you a check at that desk.
"    "Well?"    "Not one of them was worth the paper it was written on, Raffles.
  I am  overdrawn already at my bank!"    "Surely only for the moment?"    "No.
  I have spent everything.
"    "But somebody told me you were so well off.
 I heard you had come in for  money?"    "So I did.
  Three years ago.
  It has been my curse; now it's all  gone--every penny!  Yes, I've been a fool; there never was nor will be  such a fool as I've been.
.
.
.
  Isn't this enough for you?  Why don't you  turn me out?"  He was walking up and down with a very long face instead.
    "Couldn't your people do anything?" he asked at length.
    "Thank God," I cried, "I have no people!  I was an only child.
  I came  in for everything there was.
  My one comfort is that they're gone, and  will never know.
"    I cast myself into a chair and hid my face.
 Raffles continued to pace  the rich carpet that was of a piece with everything else in his rooms.
  There was no variation in his soft and even footfalls.
    "You used to be a literary little cuss," he said at length; "didn't you  edit the mag.
 before you left?  Anyway I recollect fagging you to do my  verses; and literature of all sorts is the very thing nowadays; any  fool can make a living at it.
"    I shook my head.
  "Any fool couldn't write off my debts," said I.
    "Then you have a flat somewhere?" he went on.
    "Yes, in Mount Street.
"    "Well, what about the furniture?"    I laughed aloud in my misery.
  "There's been a bill of sale on every  stick for months!"    And at that Raffles stood still, with raised eyebrows and stern eyes  that I could meet the better now that he knew the worst; then, with a  shrug, he resumed his walk, and for some minutes neither of us spoke.
  But in his handsome, unmoved face I read my fate and death-warrant; and  with every breath I cursed my folly and my cowardice in coming to him  at all.
  Because he had been kind to me at school, when he was captain  of the eleven, and I his fag, I had dared to look for kindness from him  now; because I was ruined, and he rich enough to play cricket all the  summer, and do nothing for the rest of the year, I had fatuously  counted on his mercy, his sympathy, his help!  Yes, I had relied on him  in my heart, for all my outward diffidence and humility; and I was  rightly served.
  There was as little of mercy as of sympathy in that  curling nostril, that rigid jaw, that cold blue eye which never glanced  my way.
  I caught up my hat.
  I blundered to my feet.
  I would have  gone without a word; but Raffles stood between me and the door.
    "Where are you going?" said he.
    "That's my business," I replied.
  "I won't trouble YOU any more.
"    "Then how am I to help you?"    "I didn't ask your help.
"    "Then why come to me?"    "Why, indeed!" I echoed.
  "Will you let me pass?"    "Not until you tell me where you are going and what you mean to do.
"    "Can't you guess?" I cried.
  And for many seconds we stood staring in  each other's eyes.
    "Have you got the pluck?" said he, breaking the spell in a tone so  cynical that it brought my last drop of blood to the boil.
    "You shall see," said I, as I stepped back and whipped the pistol from  my overcoat pocket.
 "Now, will you let me pass or shall I do it here?"    The barrel touched my temple, and my thumb the trigger.
  Mad with  excitement as I was, ruined, dishonored, and now finally determined to  make an end of my misspent life, my only surprise to this day is that I  did not do so then and there.
 The despicable satisfaction of involving  another in one's destruction added its miserable appeal to my baser  egoism; and had fear or horror flown to my companion's face, I shudder  to think I might have died diabolically happy with that look for my  last impious consolation.
  It was the look that came instead which held  my hand.
  Neither fear nor horror were in it; only wonder, admiration,  and such a measure of pleased expectancy as caused me after all to  pocket my revolver with an oath.
    "You devil!" I said.
  "I believe you wanted me to do it!"    "Not quite," was the reply, made with a little start, and a change of  color that came too late.
 "To tell you the truth, though, I half  thought you meant it, and I was never more fascinated in my life.
  I  never dreamt you had such stuff in you, Bunny!  No, I'm hanged if I let  you go now.
  And you'd better not try that game again, for you won't  catch me stand and look on a second time.
  We must think of some way  out of the mess.
  I had no idea you were a chap of that sort!  There,  let me have the gun.
"    One of his hands fell kindly on my shoulder, while the other slipped  into my overcoat pocket, and I suffered him to deprive me of my weapon  without a murmur.
  Nor was this simply because Raffles had the subtle  power of making himself irresistible at will.
  He was beyond comparison  the most masterful man whom I have ever known; yet my acquiescence was  due to more than the mere subjection of the weaker nature to the  stronger.
 The forlorn hope which had brought me to the Albany was  turned as by magic into an almost staggering sense of safety.
  Raffles  would help me after all!  A.
 J.
 Raffles would be my friend!  It was as  though all the world had come round suddenly to my side; so far  therefore from resisting his action, I caught and clasped his hand with  a fervor as uncontrollable as the frenzy which had preceded it.
    "God bless you!" I cried.
  "Forgive me for everything.
  I will tell you  the truth.
  I DID think you might help me in my extremity, though I  well knew that I had no claim upon you.
  Still--for the old school's  sake--the sake of old times--I thought you might give me another  chance.
  If you wouldn't I meant to blow out my brains--and will still  if you change your mind!"    In truth I feared that it was changing, with his expression, even as I  spoke, and in spite of his kindly tone and kindlier use of my old  school nickname.
  His next words showed me my mistake.
    "What a boy it is for jumping to conclusions! I have my vices, Bunny,  but backing and filling is not one of them.
  Sit down, my good fellow,  and have a cigarette to soothe your nerves.
  I insist.
  Whiskey?  The  worst thing for you; here's some coffee that I was brewing when you  came in.
  Now listen to me.
  You speak of 'another chance.
'  What do  you mean?  Another chance at baccarat?  Not if I know it!  You think  the luck must turn; suppose it didn't?  We should only have made bad  worse.
  No, my dear chap, you've plunged enough.
 Do you put yourself in  my hands or do you not? Very well, then you plunge no more, and I  undertake not to present my check.
  Unfortunately there are the other  men; and still more unfortunately, Bunny, I'm as hard up at this moment  as you are yourself!"    It was my turn to stare at Raffles.
  "You?" I vociferated.
  "You hard  up?  How am I to sit here and believe that?"    "Did I refuse to believe it of you?" he returned, smiling.
  "And, with  your own experience, do you think that because a fellow has rooms in  this place, and belongs to a club or two, and plays a little cricket,  he must necessarily have a balance at the bank?  I tell you, my dear  man, that at this moment I'm as hard up as you ever were.
  I have  nothing but my wits to live on--absolutely nothing else.
 It was as  necessary for me to win some money this evening as it was for you.
  We're in the same boat, Bunny; we'd better pull together.
"    "Together!"  I jumped at it.
  "I'll do anything in this world for you,  Raffles," I said, "if you really mean that you won't give me away.
  Think of anything you like, and I'll do it!  I was a desperate man when  I came here, and I'm just as desperate now.
  I don't mind what I do if  only I can get out of this without a scandal.
"    Again I see him, leaning back in one of the luxurious chairs with which  his room was furnished.
 I see his indolent, athletic figure; his pale,  sharp, clean-shaven features; his curly black hair; his strong,  unscrupulous mouth.
  And again I feel the clear beam of his wonderful  eye, cold and luminous as a star, shining into my brain--sifting the  very secrets of my heart.
    "I wonder if you mean all that!" he said at length.
  "You do in your  present mood; but who can back his mood to last?  Still, there's hope  when a chap takes that tone.
  Now I think of it, too, you were a plucky  little devil at school; you once did me rather a good turn, I  recollect.
  Remember it, Bunny?  Well, wait a bit, and perhaps I'll be  able to do you a better one.
  Give me time to think.
"    He got up, lit a fresh cigarette, and fell to pacing the room once  more, but with a slower and more thoughtful step, and for a much longer  period than before.
  Twice he stopped at my chair as though on the  point of speaking, but each time he checked himself and resumed his  stride in silence.
  Once he threw up the window, which he had shut some  time since, and stood for some moments leaning out into the fog which  filled the Albany courtyard.
  Meanwhile a clock on the chimney-piece  struck one, and one again for the half-hour, without a word between us.
    Yet I not only kept my chair with patience, but I acquired an  incongruous equanimity in that half-hour.
  Insensibly I had shifted my  burden to the broad shoulders of this splendid friend, and my thoughts  wandered with my eyes as the minutes passed.
  The room was the  good-sized, square one, with the folding doors, the marble  mantel-piece, and the gloomy, old-fashioned distinction peculiar to the  Albany.
  It was charmingly furnished and arranged, with the right  amount of negligence and the right amount of taste.
  What struck me  most, however, was the absence of the usual insignia of a cricketer's  den.
  Instead of the conventional rack of war-worn bats, a carved oak  bookcase, with every shelf in a litter, filled the better part of one  wall; and where I looked for cricketing groups, I found reproductions  of such works as "Love and Death" and "The Blessed Damozel," in dusty  frames and different parallels.
  The man might have been a minor poet  instead of an athlete of the first water.
  But there had always been a  fine streak of aestheticism in his complex composition; some of these  very pictures I had myself dusted in his study at school; and they set  me thinking of yet another of his many sides--and of the little  incident to which he had just referred.
    Everybody knows how largely the tone of a public school depends on that  of the eleven, and on the character of the captain of cricket in  particular; and I have never heard it denied that in A.
 J.
 Raffles's  time our tone was good, or that such influence as he troubled to exert  was on the side of the angels.
  Yet it was whispered in the school that  he was in the habit of parading the town at night in loud checks and a  false beard.
  It was whispered, and disbelieved.
  I alone knew it for a  fact; for night after night had I pulled the rope up after him when the  rest of the dormitory were asleep, and kept awake by the hour to let it  down again on a given signal.
  Well, one night he was over-bold, and  within an ace of ignominious expulsion in the hey-day of his fame.
  Consummate daring and extraordinary nerve on his part, aided,  doubtless, by some little presence of mind on mine, averted the  untoward result; and no more need be said of a discreditable incident.
  But I cannot pretend to have forgotten it in throwing myself on this  man's mercy in my desperation.
  And I was wondering how much of his  leniency was owing to the fact that Raffles had not forgotten it  either, when he stopped and stood over my chair once more.
    "I've been thinking of that night we had the narrow squeak," he began.
  "Why do you start?"    "I was thinking of it too.
"    He smiled, as though he had read my thoughts.
    "Well, you were the right sort of little beggar then, Bunny; you didn't  talk and you didn't flinch.
 You asked no questions and you told no  tales.
  I wonder if you're like that now?"    "I don't know," said I, slightly puzzled by his tone.
  "I've made such  a mess of my own affairs that I trust myself about as little as I'm  likely to be trusted by anybody else.
  Yet I never in my life went back  on a friend.
  I will say that, otherwise perhaps I mightn't be in such  a hole to-night.
"    "Exactly," said Raffles, nodding to himself, as though in assent to  some hidden train of thought; "exactly what I remember of you, and I'll  bet it's as true now as it was ten years ago.
  We don't alter, Bunny.
  We only develop.
  I suppose neither you nor I are really altered since  you used to let down that rope and I used to come up it hand over hand.
  You would stick at nothing for a pal--what?"    "At nothing in this world," I was pleased to cry.
    "Not even at a crime?" said Raffles, smiling.
    I stopped to think, for his tone had changed, and I felt sure he was  chaffing me.
  Yet his eye seemed as much in earnest as ever, and for my  part I was in no mood for reservations.
    "No, not even at that," I declared; "name your crime, and I'm your man.
"    He looked at me one moment in wonder, and another moment in doubt; then  turned the matter off with a shake of his head, and the little cynical  laugh that was all his own.
    "You're a nice chap, Bunny!  A real desperate character--what?  Suicide  one moment, and any crime I like the next!  What you want is a drag, my  boy, and you did well to come to a decent law-abiding citizen with a  reputation to lose.
  None the less we must have that money to-night--by  hook or crook.
"    "To-night, Raffles?"    "The sooner the better.
  Every hour after ten o'clock to-morrow morning  is an hour of risk.
  Let one of those checks get round to your own  bank, and you and it are dishonored together.
  No, we must raise the  wind to-night and re-open your account first thing to-morrow.
  And I  rather think I know where the wind can be raised.
"    "At two o'clock in the morning?"    "Yes.
"    "But how--but where--at such an hour?"    "From a friend of mine here in Bond Street.
"    "He must be a very intimate friend!"    "Intimate's not the word.
  I have the run of his place and a latch-key  all to myself.
"    "You would knock him up at this hour of the night?"    "If he's in bed.
"    "And it's essential that I should go in with you?"    "Absolutely.
"    "Then I must; but I'm bound to say I don't like the idea, Raffles.
"    "Do you prefer the alternative?" asked my companion, with a sneer.
  "No, hang it, that's unfair!" he cried apologetically in the same  breath.
  "I quite understand.
  It's a beastly ordeal.
  But it would  never do for you to stay outside.
  I tell you what, you shall have a  peg before we start--just one.
  There's the whiskey, here's a syphon,  and I'll be putting on an overcoat while you help yourself.
"    Well, I daresay I did so with some freedom, for this plan of his was  not the less distasteful to me from its apparent inevitability.
  I must  own, however, that it possessed fewer terrors before my glass was  empty.
  Meanwhile Raffles rejoined me, with a covert coat over his  blazer, and a soft felt hat set carelessly on the curly head he shook  with a smile as I passed him the decanter.
    "When we come back," said he.
  "Work first, play afterward.
  Do you see  what day it is?" he added, tearing a leaflet from a Shakespearian  calendar, as I drained my glass.
  "March 15th.
  'The Ides of March, the  Ides of March, remember.
' Eh, Bunny, my boy?  You won't forget them,  will you?"    And, with a laugh, he threw some coals on the fire before turning down  the gas like a careful householder.
  So we went out together as the  clock on the chimney-piece was striking two.
      II    Piccadilly was a trench of raw white fog, rimmed with blurred  street-lamps, and lined with a thin coating of adhesive mud.
  We met no  other wayfarers on the deserted flagstones, and were ourselves favored  with a very hard stare from the constable of the beat, who, however,  touched his helmet on recognizing my companion.
    "You see, I'm known to the police," laughed Raffles as we passed on.
  "Poor devils, they've got to keep their weather eye open on a night  like this!  A fog may be a bore to you and me, Bunny, but it's a  perfect godsend to the criminal classes, especially so late in their  season.
  Here we are, though--and I'm hanged if the beggar isn't in bed  and asleep after all!"    We had turned into Bond Street, and had halted on the curb a few yards  down on the right.
  Raffles was gazing up at some windows across the  road, windows barely discernible through the mist, and without the  glimmer of a light to throw them out.
 They were over a jeweller's shop,  as I could see by the peep-hole in the shop door, and the bright light  burning within.
  But the entire "upper part," with the private  street-door next the shop, was black and blank as the sky itself.
    "Better give it up for to-night," I urged.
 "Surely the morning will be  time enough!"    "Not a bit of it," said Raffles.
  "I have his key.
 We'll surprise him.
  Come along.
"    And seizing my right arm, he hurried me across the road, opened the  door with his latch-key, and in another moment had shut it swiftly but  softly behind us.
  We stood together in the dark.
  Outside, a measured  step was approaching; we had heard it through the fog as we crossed the  street; now, as it drew nearer, my companion's fingers tightened on my  arm.
    "It may be the chap himself," he whispered.
 "He's the devil of a  night-bird.
  Not a sound, Bunny!  We'll startle the life out of him.
  Ah!"    The measured step had passed without a pause.
 Raffles drew a deep  breath, and his singular grip of me slowly relaxed.
    "But still, not a sound," he continued in the same whisper; "we'll take  a rise out of him, wherever he is!  Slip off your shoes and follow me.
"    Well, you may wonder at my doing so; but you can never have met A.
 J.
  Raffles.
  Half his power lay in a conciliating trick of sinking the  commander in the leader.
  And it was impossible not to follow one who  led with such a zest.
  You might question, but you followed first.
  So  now, when I heard him kick off his own shoes, I did the same, and was  on the stairs at his heels before I realized what an extraordinary way  was this of approaching a stranger for money in the dead of night.
  But  obviously Raffles and he were on exceptional terms of intimacy, and I  could not but infer that they were in the habit of playing practical  jokes upon each other.
    We groped our way so slowly upstairs that I had time to make more than  one note before we reached the top.
  The stair was uncarpeted.
  The  spread fingers of my right hand encountered nothing on the damp wall;  those of my left trailed through a dust that could be felt on the  banisters.
 An eerie sensation had been upon me since we entered the  house.
  It increased with every step we climbed.
  What hermit were we  going to startle in his cell?    We came to a landing.
  The banisters led us to the left, and to the  left again.
  Four steps more, and we were on another and a longer  landing, and suddenly a match blazed from the black.
  I never heard it  struck.
  Its flash was blinding.
  When my eyes became accustomed to the  light, there was Raffles holding up the match with one hand, and  shading it with the other, between bare boards, stripped walls, and the  open doors of empty rooms.
    "Where have you brought me?" I cried.
  "The house is unoccupied!"    "Hush!  Wait!" he whispered, and he led the way into one of the empty  rooms.
  His match went out as we crossed the threshold, and he struck  another without the slightest noise.
  Then he stood with his back to  me, fumbling with something that I could not see.
  But, when he threw  the second match away, there was some other light in its stead, and a  slight smell of oil.
  I stepped forward to look over his shoulder, but  before I could do so he had turned and flashed a tiny lantern in my  face.
    "What's this?" I gasped.
  "What rotten trick are you going to play?"    "It's played," he answered, with his quiet laugh.
    "On me?"    "I am afraid so, Bunny.
"    "Is there no one in the house, then?"    "No one but ourselves.
"    "So it was mere chaff about your friend in Bond Street, who could let  us have that money?"    "Not altogether.
  It's quite true that Danby is a friend of mine.
"    "Danby?"    "The jeweller underneath.
"    "What do you mean?" I whispered, trembling like a leaf as his meaning  dawned upon me.
  "Are we to get the money from the jeweller?"    "Well, not exactly.
"    "What, then?"    "The equivalent--from his shop.
"    There was no need for another question.
  I understood everything but my  own density.
  He had given me a dozen hints, and I had taken none.
 And  there I stood staring at him, in that empty room; and there he stood  with his dark lantern, laughing at me.
    "A burglar!" I gasped.
  "You--you!"    "I told you I lived by my wits.
"    "Why couldn't you tell me what you were going to do?  Why couldn't you  trust me?  Why must you lie?" I demanded, piqued to the quick for all  my horror.
    "I wanted to tell you," said he.
  "I was on the point of telling you  more than once.
  You may remember how I sounded you about crime, though  you have probably forgotten what you said yourself.
  I didn't think you  meant it at the time, but I thought I'd put you to the test.
  Now I see  you didn't, and I don't blame you.
  I only am to blame.
 Get out of it,  my dear boy, as quick as you can; leave it to me.
  You won't give me  away, whatever else you do!"    Oh, his cleverness!  His fiendish cleverness! Had he fallen back on  threats, coercion, sneers, all might have been different even yet.
  But  he set me free to leave him in the lurch.
  He would not blame me.
  He  did not even bind me to secrecy; he trusted me.
  He knew my weakness  and my strength, and was playing on both with his master's touch.
    "Not so fast," said I.
  "Did I put this into your head, or were you  going to do it in any case?"    "Not in any case," said Raffles.
  "It's true I've had the key for days,  but when I won to-night I thought of chucking it; for, as a matter of  fact, it's not a one-man job.
"    "That settles it.
  I'm your man.
"    "You mean it?"    "Yes--for to-night.
"    "Good old Bunny," he murmured, holding the lantern for one moment to my  face; the next he was explaining his plans, and I was nodding, as  though we had been fellow-cracksmen all our days.
    "I know the shop," he whispered, "because I've got a few things there.
  I know this upper part too; it's been to let for a month, and I got an  order to view, and took a cast of the key before using it.
 The one  thing I don't know is how to make a connection between the two; at  present there's none.
 We may make it up here, though I rather fancy the  basement myself.
  If you wait a minute I'll tell you.
"    He set his lantern on the floor, crept to a back window, and opened it  with scarcely a sound: only to return, shaking his head, after shutting  the window with the same care.
    "That was our one chance," said he; "a back window above a back window;  but it's too dark to see anything, and we daren't show an outside  light.
 Come down after me to the basement; and remember, though there's  not a soul on the premises, you can't make too little noise.
  There--there--listen to that!"    It was the measured tread that we had heard before on the flagstones  outside.
  Raffles darkened his lantern, and again we stood motionless  till it had passed.
    "Either a policeman," he muttered, "or a watchman that all these  jewellers run between them.
 The watchman's the man for us to watch;  he's simply paid to spot this kind of thing.
"    We crept very gingerly down the stairs, which creaked a bit in spite of  us, and we picked up our shoes in the passage; then down some narrow  stone steps, at the foot of which Raffles showed his light, and put on  his shoes once more, bidding me do the same in a rather louder tone  than he had permitted himself to employ overhead.
  We were now  considerably below the level of the street, in a small space with as  many doors as it had sides.
  Three were ajar, and we saw through them  into empty cellars; but in the fourth a key was turned and a bolt  drawn; and this one presently let us out into the bottom of a deep,  square well of fog.
  A similar door faced it across this area, and  Raffles had the lantern close against it, and was hiding the light with  his body, when a short and sudden crash made my heart stand still.
  Next moment I saw the door wide open, and Raffles standing within and  beckoning me with a jimmy.
    "Door number one," he whispered.
  "Deuce knows how many more there'll  be, but I know of two at least.
  We won't have to make much noise over  them, either; down here there's less risk.
"    We were now at the bottom of the exact fellow to the narrow stone stair  which we had just descended: the yard, or well, being the one part  common to both the private and the business premises.
  But this flight  led to no open passage; instead, a singularly solid mahogany door  confronted us at the top.
    "I thought so," muttered Raffles, handing me the lantern, and pocketing  a bunch of skeleton keys, after tampering for a few minutes with the  lock.
 "It'll be an hour's work to get through that!"    "Can't you pick it?"    "No: I know these locks.
  It's no use trying.
 We must cut it out, and  it'll take us an hour.
"    It took us forty-seven minutes by my watch; or, rather, it took  Raffles; and never in my life have I seen anything more deliberately  done.
  My part was simply to stand by with the dark lantern in one  hand, and a small bottle of rock-oil in the other.
    Raffles had produced a pretty embroidered case, intended obviously for  his razors, but filled instead with the tools of his secret trade,  including the rock-oil.
  From this case he selected a "bit," capable of  drilling a hole an inch in diameter, and fitted it to a small but very  strong steel "brace.
" Then he took off his covert-coat and his blazer,  spread them neatly on the top step--knelt on them--turned up his shirt  cuffs--and went to work with brace-and-bit near the key-hole.
  But  first he oiled the bit to minimize the noise, and this he did  invariably before beginning a fresh hole, and often in the middle of  one.
  It took thirty-two separate borings to cut around that lock.
    I noticed that through the first circular orifice Raffles thrust a  forefinger; then, as the circle became an ever-lengthening oval, he got  his hand through up to the thumb; and I heard him swear softly to  himself.
    "I was afraid so!"    "What is it?"    "An iron gate on the other side!"    "How on earth are we to get through that?" I asked in dismay.
    "Pick the lock.
  But there may be two.
  In that case they'll be top and  bottom, and we shall have two fresh holes to make, as the door opens  inwards.
 It won't open two inches as it is.
"    I confess I did not feel sanguine about the lock-picking, seeing that  one lock had baffled us already; and my disappointment and impatience  must have been a revelation to me had I stopped to think.
 The truth is  that I was entering into our nefarious undertaking with an involuntary  zeal of which I was myself quite unconscious at the time.
  The romance  and the peril of the whole proceeding held me spellbound and entranced.
  My moral sense and my sense of fear were stricken by a common  paralysis.
  And there I stood, shining my light and holding my phial  with a keener interest than I had ever brought to any honest avocation.
  And there knelt A.
 J.
 Raffles, with his black hair tumbled, and the  same watchful, quiet, determined half-smile with which I have seen him  send down over after over in a county match!    At last the chain of holes was complete, the lock wrenched out bodily,  and a splendid bare arm plunged up to the shoulder through the  aperture, and through the bars of the iron gate beyond.
    "Now," whispered Raffles, "if there's only one lock it'll be in the  middle.
  Joy!  Here it is!  Only let me pick it, and we're through at  last.
"    He withdrew his arm, a skeleton key was selected from the bunch, and  then back went his arm to the shoulder.
  It was a breathless moment.
  I  heard the heart throbbing in my body, the very watch ticking in my  pocket, and ever and anon the tinkle-tinkle of the skeleton key.
  Then--at last--there came a single unmistakable click.
  In another  minute the mahogany door and the iron gate yawned behind us; and  Raffles was sitting on an office table, wiping his face, with the  lantern throwing a steady beam by his side.
    We were now in a bare and roomy lobby behind the shop, but separated  therefrom by an iron curtain, the very sight of which filled me with  despair.
 Raffles, however, did not appear in the least depressed, but  hung up his coat and hat on some pegs in the lobby before examining  this curtain with his lantern.
    "That's nothing," said he, after a minute's inspection; "we'll be  through that in no time, but there's a door on the other side which may  give us trouble.
"    "Another door!" I groaned.
  "And how do you mean to tackle this thing?"    "Prise it up with the jointed jimmy.
  The weak point of these iron  curtains is the leverage you can get from below.
  But it makes a noise,  and this is where you're coming in, Bunny; this is where I couldn't do  without you.
  I must have you overhead to knock through when the  street's clear.
 I'll come with you and show a light.
"    Well, you may imagine how little I liked the prospect of this lonely  vigil; and yet there was something very stimulating in the vital  responsibility which it involved.
  Hitherto I had been a mere  spectator.
  Now I was to take part in the game.
 And the fresh  excitement made me more than ever insensible to those considerations of  conscience and of safety which were already as dead nerves in my breast.
    So I took my post without a murmur in the front room above the shop.
  The fixtures had been left for the refusal of the incoming tenant, and  fortunately for us they included Venetian blinds which were already  down.
  It was the simplest matter in the world to stand peeping through  the laths into the street, to beat twice with my foot when anybody was  approaching, and once when all was clear again.
  The noises that even I  could hear below, with the exception of one metallic crash at the  beginning, were indeed incredibly slight; but they ceased altogether at  each double rap from my toe; and a policeman passed quite half a dozen  times beneath my eyes, and the man whom I took to be the jeweller's  watchman oftener still, during the better part of an hour that I spent  at the window.
  Once, indeed, my heart was in my mouth, but only once.
  It was when the watchman stopped and peered through the peep-hole into  the lighted shop.
  I waited for his whistle--I waited for the gallows  or the gaol!  But my signals had been studiously obeyed, and the man  passed on in undisturbed serenity.
    In the end I had a signal in my turn, and retraced my steps with  lighted matches, down the broad stairs, down the narrow ones, across  the area, and up into the lobby where Raffles awaited me with an  outstretched hand.
    "Well done, my boy!" said he.
  "You're the same good man in a pinch,  and you shall have your reward.
  I've got a thousand pounds' worth if  I've got a penn'oth.
  It's all in my pockets.
  And here's something  else I found in this locker; very decent port and some cigars, meant  for poor dear Danby's business friends.
  Take a pull, and you shall  light up presently.
  I've found a lavatory, too, and we must have a  wash-and-brush-up before we go, for I'm as black as your boot.
"    The iron curtain was down, but he insisted on raising it until I could  peep through the glass door on the other side and see his handiwork in  the shop beyond.
  Here two electric lights were left burning all night  long, and in their cold white rays I could at first see nothing amiss.
  I looked along an orderly lane, an empty glass counter on my left,  glass cupboards of untouched silver on my right, and facing me the  filmy black eye of the peep-hole that shone like a stage moon on the  street.
  The counter had not been emptied by Raffles; its contents were  in the Chubb's safe, which he had given up at a glance; nor had he  looked at the silver, except to choose a cigarette case for me.
  He had  confined himself entirely to the shop window.
  This was in three  compartments, each secured for the night by removable panels with  separate locks.
 Raffles had removed them a few hours before their time,  and the electric light shone on a corrugated shutter bare as the ribs  of an empty carcase.
  Every article of value was gone from the one  place which was invisible from the little window in the door; elsewhere  all was as it had been left overnight.
 And but for a train of mangled  doors behind the iron curtain, a bottle of wine and a cigar-box with  which liberties had been taken, a rather black towel in the lavatory, a  burnt match here and there, and our finger-marks on the dusty  banisters, not a trace of our visit did we leave.
    "Had it in my head for long?" said Raffles, as we strolled through the  streets towards dawn, for all the world as though we were returning  from a dance.
  "No, Bunny, I never thought of it till I saw that upper  part empty about a month ago, and bought a few things in the shop to  get the lie of the land.
  That reminds me that I never paid for them;  but, by Jove, I will to-morrow, and if that isn't poetic justice, what  is?  One visit showed me the possibilities of the place, but a second  convinced me of its impossibilities without a pal.
  So I had  practically given up the idea, when you came along on the very night  and in the very plight for it!  But here we are at the Albany, and I  hope there's some fire left; for I don't know how you feel, Bunny, but  for my part I'm as cold as Keats's owl.
"    He could think of Keats on his way from a felony!  He could hanker for  his fireside like another!  Floodgates were loosed within me, and the  plain English of our adventure rushed over me as cold as ice.
  Raffles  was a burglar.
  I had helped him to commit one burglary, therefore I  was a burglar, too.
  Yet I could stand and warm myself by his fire, and  watch him empty his pockets, as though we had done nothing wonderful or  wicked!    My blood froze.
  My heart sickened.
  My brain whirled.
  How I had liked  this villain!  How I had admired him!  Now my liking and admiration  must turn to loathing and disgust.
  I waited for the change.
  I longed  to feel it in my heart.
  But--I longed and I waited in vain!    I saw that he was emptying his pockets; the table sparkled with their  hoard.
  Rings by the dozen, diamonds by the score; bracelets, pendants,  aigrettes, necklaces, pearls, rubies, amethysts, sapphires; and  diamonds always, diamonds in everything, flashing bayonets of light,  dazzling me--blinding me--making me disbelieve because I could no  longer forget.
  Last of all came no gem, indeed, but my own revolver  from an inner pocket.
 And that struck a chord.
  I suppose I said  something--my hand flew out.
  I can see Raffles now, as he looked at me  once more with a high arch over each clear eye.
  I can see him pick out  the cartridges with his quiet, cynical smile, before he would give me  my pistol back again.
    "You mayn't believe it, Bunny," said he, "but I never carried a loaded  one before.
  On the whole I think it gives one confidence.
  Yet it  would be very awkward if anything went wrong; one might use it, and  that's not the game at all, though I have often thought that the  murderer who has just done the trick must have great sensations before  things get too hot for him.
  Don't look so distressed, my dear chap.
  I've never had those sensations, and I don't suppose I ever shall.
"    "But this much you have done before?" said I hoarsely.
    "Before?  My dear Bunny, you offend me!  Did it look like a first  attempt?  Of course I have done it before.
"    "Often?"    "Well--no!  Not often enough to destroy the charm, at all events;  never, as a matter of fact, unless I'm cursedly hard up.
  Did you hear  about the Thimbleby diamonds?  Well, that was the last time--and a poor  lot of paste they were.
  Then there was the little business of the  Dormer house-boat at Henley last year.
  That was mine also--such as it  was.
  I've never brought off a really big coup yet; when I do I shall  chuck it up.
"    Yes, I remembered both cases very well.
  To think that he was their  author!  It was incredible, outrageous, inconceivable.
  Then my eyes  would fall upon the table, twinkling and glittering in a hundred  places, and incredulity was at an end.
    "How came you to begin?" I asked, as curiosity overcame mere wonder,  and a fascination for his career gradually wove itself into my  fascination for the man.
    "Ah! that's a long story," said Raffles.
  "It was in the Colonies, when  I was out there playing cricket.
  It's too long a story to tell you  now, but I was in much the same fix that you were in to-night, and it  was my only way out.
  I never meant it for anything more; but I'd  tasted blood, and it was all over with me.
  Why should I work when I  could steal?  Why settle down to some humdrum uncongenial billet, when  excitement, romance, danger and a decent living were all going begging  together?  Of course it's very wrong, but we can't all be moralists,  and the distribution of wealth is very wrong to begin with.
  Besides,  you're not at it all the time.
  I'm sick of quoting Gilbert's lines to  myself, but they're profoundly true.
  I only wonder if you'll like the  life as much as I do!"    "Like it?" I cried out.
  "Not I!  It's no life for me.
  Once is enough!"    "You wouldn't give me a hand another time?"    "Don't ask me, Raffles.
  Don't ask me, for God's sake!"    "Yet you said you would do anything for me! You asked me to name my  crime!  But I knew at the time you didn't mean it; you didn't go back  on me to-night, and that ought to satisfy me, goodness knows!  I  suppose I'm ungrateful, and unreasonable, and all that.
  I ought to let  it end at this.
  But you're the very man for me, Bunny, the--very--man!  Just think how we got through to-night.
  Not a scratch--not a hitch!  There's nothing very terrible in it, you see; there never would be,  while we worked together.
"    He was standing in front of me with a hand on either shoulder; he was  smiling as he knew so well how to smile.
  I turned on my heel, planted  my elbows on the chimney-piece, and my burning head between my hands.
  Next instant a still heartier hand had fallen on my back.
    "All right, my boy!  You are quite right and I'm worse than wrong.
  I'll never ask it again.
 Go, if you want to, and come again about  mid-day for the cash.
  There was no bargain; but, of course, I'll get  you out of your scrape--especially after the way you've stood by me  to-night.
"    I was round again with my blood on fire.
    "I'll do it again," I said, through my teeth.
    He shook his head.
  "Not you," he said, smiling quite good-humoredly on  my insane enthusiasm.
    "I will," I cried with an oath.
  "I'll lend you a hand as often as you  like!  What does it matter now?  I've been in it once.
  I'll be in it  again.
  I've gone to the devil anyhow.
  I can't go back, and wouldn't  if I could.
  Nothing matters another rap!  When you want me, I'm your  man!"    And that is how Raffles and I joined felonious forces on the Ides of  March.
        A COSTUME PIECE    London was just then talking of one whose name is already a name and  nothing more.
 Reuben Rosenthall had made his millions on the diamond  fields of South Africa, and had come home to enjoy them according to  his lights; how he went to work will scarcely be forgotten by any  reader of the halfpenny evening papers, which revelled in endless  anecdotes of his original indigence and present prodigality, varied  with interesting particulars of the extraordinary establishment which  the millionaire set up in St.
  John's Wood.
  Here he kept a retinue of  Kaffirs, who were literally his slaves; and hence he would sally, with  enormous diamonds in his shirt and on his finger, in the convoy of a  prize-fighter of heinous repute, who was not, however, by any means the  worst element in the Rosenthall melange.
  So said common gossip; but  the fact was sufficiently established by the interference of the police  on at least one occasion, followed by certain magisterial proceedings  which were reported with justifiable gusto and huge headlines in the  newspapers aforesaid.
    And this was all one knew of Reuben Rosenthall up to the time when the  Old Bohemian Club, having fallen on evil days, found it worth its while  to organize a great dinner in honor of so wealthy an exponent of the  club's principles.
  I was not at the banquet myself, but a member took  Raffles, who told me all about it that very night.
    "Most extraordinary show I ever went to in my life," said he.
  "As for  the man himself--well, I was prepared for something grotesque, but the  fellow fairly took my breath away.
  To begin with, he's the most  astounding brute to look at, well over six feet, with a chest like a  barrel, and a great hook-nose, and the reddest hair and whiskers you  ever saw.
  Drank like a fire-engine, but only got drunk enough to make  us a speech that I wouldn't have missed for ten pounds.
  I'm only sorry  you weren't there, too, Bunny, old chap.
"    I began to be sorry myself, for Raffles was anything but an excitable  person, and never had I seen him so excited before.
  Had he been  following Rosenthall's example?  His coming to my rooms at midnight,  merely to tell me about his dinner, was in itself enough to excuse a  suspicion which was certainly at variance with my knowledge of A.
 J.
  Raffles.
    "What did he say?" I inquired mechanically, divining some subtler  explanation of this visit, and wondering what on earth it could be.
    "Say?" cried Raffles.
  "What did he not say!  He boasted of his rise,  he bragged of his riches, and he blackguarded society for taking him up  for his money and dropping him out of sheer pique and jealousy because  he had so much.
  He mentioned names, too, with the most charming  freedom, and swore he was as good a man as the Old Country had to  show--PACE the Old Bohemians.
 To prove it he pointed to a great diamond  in the middle of his shirt-front with a little finger loaded with  another just like it: which of our bloated princes could show a pair  like that?  As a matter of fact, they seemed quite wonderful stones,  with a curious purple gleam to them that must mean a pot of money.
  But  old Rosenthall swore he wouldn't take fifty thousand pounds for the  two, and wanted to know where the other man was who went about with  twenty-five thousand in his shirt-front and another twenty-five on his  little finger.
 He didn't exist.
  If he did, he wouldn't have the pluck  to wear them.
  But he had--he'd tell us why.
 And before you could say  Jack Robinson he had whipped out a whacking great revolver!"    "Not at the table?"    "At the table!  In the middle of his speech!  But it was nothing to  what he wanted to do.
  He actually wanted us to let him write his name  in bullets on the opposite wall, to show us why he wasn't afraid to go  about in all his diamonds!  That brute Purvis, the prize-fighter, who  is his paid bully, had to bully his master before he could be persuaded  out of it.
  There was quite a panic for the moment; one fellow was  saying his prayers under the table, and the waiters bolted to a man.
"    "What a grotesque scene!"    "Grotesque enough, but I rather wish they had let him go the whole hog  and blaze away.
  He was as keen as knives to show us how he could take  care of his purple diamonds; and, do you know, Bunny, _I_ was as keen  as knives to see.
"    And Raffles leaned towards me with a sly, slow smile that made the  hidden meaning of his visit only too plain to me at last.
    "So you think of having a try for his diamonds yourself?"    He shrugged his shoulders.
    "It is horribly obvious, I admit.
  But--yes, I have set my heart upon  them!  To be quite frank, I have had them on my conscience for some  time; one couldn't hear so much of the man, and his prize-fighter, and  his diamonds, without feeling it a kind of duty to have a go for them;  but when it comes to brandishing a revolver and practically challenging  the world, the thing becomes inevitable.
  It is simply thrust upon one.
  I was fated to hear that challenge, Bunny, and I, for one, must take it  up.
  I was only sorry I couldn't get on my hind legs and say so then  and there.
"    "Well," I said, "I don't see the necessity as things are with us; but,  of course, I'm your man.
"    My tone may have been half-hearted.
  I did my best to make it  otherwise.
  But it was barely a month since our Bond Street exploit,  and we certainly could have afforded to behave ourselves for some time  to come.
  We had been getting along so nicely: by his advice I had  scribbled a thing or two; inspired by Raffles, I had even done an  article on our own jewel robbery; and for the moment I was quite  satisfied with this sort of adventure.
  I thought we ought to know when  we were well off, and could see no point in our running fresh risks  before we were obliged.
  On the other hand, I was anxious not to show  the least disposition to break the pledge that I had given a month ago.
  But it was not on my manifest disinclination that Raffles fastened.
    "Necessity, my dear Bunny?  Does the writer only write when the wolf is  at the door?  Does the painter paint for bread alone?  Must you and I  be DRIVEN to crime like Tom of Bow and Dick of Whitechapel?  You pain  me, my dear chap; you needn't laugh, because you do.
  Art for art's  sake is a vile catchword, but I confess it appeals to me.
 In this case  my motives are absolutely pure, for I doubt if we shall ever be able to  dispose of such peculiar stones.
  But if I don't have a try for  them--after to-night--I shall never be able to hold up my head again.
"    His eye twinkled, but it glittered, too.
    "We shall have our work cut out," was all I said.
    "And do you suppose I should be keen on it if we hadn't?" cried  Raffles.
  "My dear fellow, I would rob St.
 Paul's Cathedral if I could,  but I could no more scoop a till when the shopwalker wasn't looking  than I could bag the apples out of an old woman's basket.
  Even that  little business last month was a sordid affair, but it was necessary,  and I think its strategy redeemed it to some extent.
 Now there's some  credit, and more sport, in going where they boast they're on their  guard against you.
  The Bank of England, for example, is the ideal  crib; but that would need half a dozen of us with years to give to the  job; and meanwhile Reuben Rosenthall is high enough game for you and  me.
  We know he's armed.
  We know how Billy Purvis can fight.
  It'll be  no soft thing, I grant you.
 But what of that, my good Bunny--what of  that?  A man's reach must exceed his grasp, dear boy, or what the  dickens is a heaven for?"    "I would rather we didn't exceed ours just yet," I answered laughing,  for his spirit was irresistible, and the plan was growing upon me,  despite my qualms.
    "Trust me for that," was his reply; "I'll see you through.
  After all I  expect to find that the difficulties are nearly all on the surface.
  These fellows both drink like the devil, and that should simplify  matters considerably.
  But we shall see, and we must take our time.
  There will probably turn out to be a dozen different ways in which the  thing might be done, and we shall have to choose between them.
  It will  mean watching the house for at least a week in any case; it may mean  lots of other things that will take much longer; but give me a week and  I will tell you more.
  That's to say, if you're really on?"    "Of course I am," I replied indignantly.
  "But why should I give you a  week?  Why shouldn't we watch the house together?"    "Because two eyes are as good as four and take up less room.
  Never  hunt in couples unless you're obliged.
  But don't you look offended,  Bunny; there'll be plenty for you to do when the time comes, that I  promise you.
  You shall have your share of the fun, never fear, and a  purple diamond all to yourself--if we're lucky.
"    On the whole, however, this conversation left me less than lukewarm,  and I still remember the depression which came upon me when Raffles was  gone.
  I saw the folly of the enterprise to which I had committed  myself--the sheer, gratuitous, unnecessary folly of it.
  And the  paradoxes in which Raffles revelled, and the frivolous casuistry which  was nevertheless half sincere, and which his mere personality rendered  wholly plausible at the moment of utterance, appealed very little to me  when recalled in cold blood.
  I admired the spirit of pure mischief in  which he seemed prepared to risk his liberty and his life, but I did  not find it an infectious spirit on calm reflection.
  Yet the thought  of withdrawal was not to be entertained for a moment.
  On the contrary,  I was impatient of the delay ordained by Raffles; and, perhaps, no  small part of my secret disaffection came of his galling determination  to do without me until the last moment.
    It made it no better that this was characteristic of the man and of his  attitude towards me.
  For a month we had been, I suppose, the thickest  thieves in all London, and yet our intimacy was curiously incomplete.
  With all his charming frankness, there was in Raffles a vein of  capricious reserve which was perceptible enough to be very irritating.
  He had the instinctive secretiveness of the inveterate criminal.
  He  would make mysteries of matters of common concern; for example, I never  knew how or where he disposed of the Bond Street jewels, on the  proceeds of which we were both still leading the outward lives of  hundreds of other young fellows about town.
  He was consistently  mysterious about that and other details, of which it seemed to me that  I had already earned the right to know everything.
  I could not but  remember how he had led me into my first felony, by means of a trick,  while yet uncertain whether he could trust me or not.
    That I could no longer afford to resent, but I did resent his want of  confidence in me now.
  I said nothing about it, but it rankled every  day, and never more than in the week that succeeded the Rosenthall  dinner.
  When I met Raffles at the club he would tell me nothing; when  I went to his rooms he was out, or pretended to be.
    One day he told me he was getting on well, but slowly; it was a more  ticklish game than he had thought; but when I began to ask questions he  would say no more.
  Then and there, in my annoyance, I took my own  decision.
  Since he would tell me nothing of the result of his vigils,  I determined to keep one on my own account, and that very evening found  my way to the millionaire's front gates.
    The house he was occupying is, I believe, quite the largest in the St.
  John's Wood district.
  It stands in the angle formed by two broad  thoroughfares, neither of which, as it happens, is a 'bus route, and I  doubt if many quieter spots exist within the four-mile radius.
  Quiet  also was the great square house, in its garden of grass-plots and  shrubs; the lights were low, the millionaire and his friends obviously  spending their evening elsewhere.
  The garden walls were only a few  feet high.
  In one there was a side door opening into a glass passage;  in the other two five-barred, grained-and-varnished gates, one at  either end of the little semi-circular drive, and both wide open.
 So  still was the place that I had a great mind to walk boldly in and learn  something of the premises; in fact, I was on the point of doing so,  when I heard a quick, shuffling step on the pavement behind me.
  I  turned round and faced the dark scowl and the dirty clenched fists of a  dilapidated tramp.
    "You fool!" said he.
  "You utter idiot!"    "Raffles!"    "That's it," he whispered savagely; "tell all the neighborhood--give me  away at the top of your voice!"    With that he turned his back upon me, and shambled down the road,  shrugging his shoulders and muttering to himself as though I had  refused him alms.
  A few moments I stood astounded, indignant, at a  loss; then I followed him.
  His feet trailed, his knees gave, his back  was bowed, his head kept nodding; it was the gait of a man eighty years  of age.
  Presently he waited for me midway between two lamp-posts.
  As  I came up he was lighting rank tobacco, in a cutty pipe, with an  evil-smelling match, and the flame showed me the suspicion of a smile.
    "You must forgive my heat, Bunny, but it really was very foolish of  you.
  Here am I trying every dodge--begging at the door one  night--hiding in the shrubs the next--doing every mortal thing but  stand and stare at the house as you went and did.
 It's a costume piece,  and in you rush in your ordinary clothes.
  I tell you they're on the  lookout for us night and day.
  It's the toughest nut I ever tackled!"    "Well," said I, "if you had told me so before I shouldn't have come.
  You told me nothing.
"    He looked hard at me from under the broken brim of a battered billycock.
    "You're right," he said at length.
  "I've been too close.
  It's become  second nature with me when I've anything on.
  But here's an end of it,  Bunny, so far as you're concerned.
  I'm going home now, and I want you  to follow me; but for heaven's sake keep your distance, and don't speak  to me again till I speak to you.
  There--give me a start.
"  And he was  off again, a decrepit vagabond, with his hands in his pockets, his  elbows squared, and frayed coat-tails swinging raggedly from side to  side.
    I followed him to the Finchley Road.
  There he took an Atlas omnibus,  and I sat some rows behind him on the top, but not far enough to escape  the pest of his vile tobacco.
  That he could carry his character-sketch  to such a pitch--he who would only smoke one brand of cigarette!  It  was the last, least touch of the insatiable artist, and it charmed away  what mortification there still remained in me.
 Once more I felt the  fascination of a comrade who was forever dazzling one with a fresh and  unsuspected facet of his character.
    As we neared Piccadilly I wondered what he would do.
  Surely he was not  going into the Albany like that?  No, he took another omnibus to Sloane  Street, I sitting behind him as before.
  At Sloane Street we changed  again, and were presently in the long lean artery of the King's Road.
  I was now all agog to know our destination, nor was I kept many more  minutes in doubt.
  Raffles got down.
  I followed.
  He crossed the road  and disappeared up a dark turning.
  I pressed after him, and was in  time to see his coat-tails as he plunged into a still darker flagged  alley to the right.
  He was holding himself up and stepping out like a  young man once more; also, in some subtle way, he already looked less  disreputable.
  But I alone was there to see him, the alley was  absolutely deserted, and desperately dark.
  At the further end he  opened a door with a latch-key, and it was darker yet within.
    Instinctively I drew back and heard him chuckle.
 We could no longer see  each other.
    "All right, Bunny!  There's no hanky-panky this time.
  These are  studios, my friend, and I'm one of the lawful tenants.
"    Indeed, in another minute we were in a lofty room with skylight,  easels, dressing-cupboard, platform, and every other adjunct save the  signs of actual labor.
  The first thing I saw, as Raffles lit the gas,  was its reflection in his silk hat on the pegs beside the rest of his  normal garments.
    "Looking for the works of art?" continued Raffles, lighting a cigarette  and beginning to divest himself of his rags.
  "I'm afraid you won't  find any, but there's the canvas I'm always going to make a start upon.
  I tell them I'm looking high and low for my ideal model.
  I have the  stove lit on principle twice a week, and look in and leave a newspaper  and a smell of Sullivans--how good they are after shag!  Meanwhile I  pay my rent and am a good tenant in every way; and it's a very useful  little pied-a-terre--there's no saying how useful it might be at a  pinch.
  As it is, the billy-cock comes in and the topper goes out, and  nobody takes the slightest notice of either; at this time of night the  chances are that there's not a soul in the building except ourselves.
"    "You never told me you went in for disguises," said I, watching him as  he cleansed the grime from his face and hands.
    "No, Bunny, I've treated you very shabbily all round.
  There was really  no reason why I shouldn't have shown you this place a month ago, and  yet there was no point in my doing so, and circumstances are just  conceivable in which it would have suited us both for you to be in  genuine ignorance of my whereabouts.
  I have something to sleep on, as  you perceive, in case of need, and, of course, my name is not Raffles  in the King's Road.
  So you will see that one might bolt further and  fare worse.
"    "Meanwhile you use the place as a dressing-room?"    "It is my private pavilion," said Raffles.
  "Disguises?  In some cases  they're half the battle, and it's always pleasant to feel that, if the  worst comes to the worst, you needn't necessarily be convicted under  your own name.
  Then they're indispensable in dealing with the fences.
  I drive all my bargains in the tongue and raiment of Shoreditch.
  If I  didn't there'd be the very devil to pay in blackmail.
 Now, this  cupboard's full of all sorts of toggery.
 I tell the woman who cleans  the room that it's for my models when I find 'em.
  By the way, I only  hope I've got something that'll fit you, for you'll want a rig for  to-morrow night.
"    "To-morrow night!" I exclaimed.
  "Why, what do you mean to do?"    "The trick," said Raffles.
  "I intended writing to you as soon as I got  back to my rooms, to ask you to look me up to-morrow afternoon; then I  was going to unfold my plan of campaign, and take you straight into  action then and there.
  There's nothing like putting the nervous  players in first; it's the sitting with their pads on that upsets their  applecart; that was another of my reasons for being so confoundedly  close.
  You must try to forgive me.
  I couldn't help remembering how  well you played up last trip, without any time to weaken on it  beforehand.
  All I want is for you to be as cool and smart to-morrow  night as you were then; though, by Jove, there's no comparison between  the two cases!"    "I thought you would find it so.
"    "You were right.
  I have.
  Mind you, I don't say this will be the  tougher job all round; we shall probably get in without any difficulty  at all; it's the getting out again that may flummox us.
  That's the  worst of an irregular household!" cried Raffles, with quite a burst of  virtuous indignation.
  "I assure you, Bunny, I spent the whole of  Monday night in the shrubbery of the garden next door, looking over the  wall, and, if you'll believe me, somebody was about all night long!  I  don't mean the Kaffirs.
  I don't believe they ever get to bed at  all--poor devils!  No, I mean Rosenthall himself, and that pasty-faced  beast Purvis.
  They were up and drinking from midnight, when they came  in, to broad daylight, when I cleared out.
  Even then I left them sober  enough to slang each other.
  By the way, they very nearly came to blows  in the garden, within a few yards of me, and I heard something that  might come in useful and make Rosenthall shoot crooked at a critical  moment.
  You know what an I.
 D.
 B.
 is?"    "Illicit Diamond Buyer?"    "Exactly.
  Well, it seems that Rosenthall was one.
  He must have let it  out to Purvis in his cups.
 Anyhow, I heard Purvis taunting him with it,  and threatening him with the breakwater at Capetown; and I begin to  think our friends are friend and foe.
 But about to-morrow night:  there's nothing subtle in my plan.
  It's simply to get in while these  fellows are out on the loose, and to lie low till they come back, and  longer.
  If possible, we must doctor the whiskey.
  That would simplify  the whole thing, though it's not a very sporting game to play; still,  we must remember Rosenthall's revolver; we don't want him to sign his  name on US.
  With all those Kaffirs about, however, it's ten to one on  the whiskey, and a hundred to one against us if we go looking for it.
  A brush with the heathen would spoil everything, if it did no more.
  Besides, there are the ladies--"    "The deuce there are!"    "Ladies with an _I_, and the very voices for raising Cain.
  I fear, I  fear the clamor!  It would be fatal to us.
  Au contraire, if we can  manage to stow ourselves away unbeknownst, half the battle will be won.
  If Rosenthall turns in drunk, it's a purple diamond apiece.
  If he sits  up sober, it may be a bullet instead.
  We will hope not, Bunny; and all  the firing wouldn't be on one side; but it's on the knees of the gods.
"    And so we left it when we shook hands in Picadilly--not by any means as  much later as I could have wished.
  Raffles would not ask me to his  rooms that night.
  He said he made it a rule to have a long night  before playing cricket and--other games.
  His final word to me was  framed on the same principle.
    "Mind, only one drink to-night, Bunny.
  Two at the outside--as you  value your life--and mine!"    I remember my abject obedience; and the endless, sleepless night it  gave me; and the roofs of the houses opposite standing out at last  against the blue-gray London dawn.
  I wondered whether I should ever  see another, and was very hard on myself for that little expedition  which I had made on my own wilful account.
    It was between eight and nine o'clock in the evening when we took up  our position in the garden adjoining that of Reuben Rosenthall; the  house itself was shut up, thanks to the outrageous libertine next door,  who, by driving away the neighbors, had gone far towards delivering  himself into our hands.
  Practically secure from surprise on that side,  we could watch our house under cover of a wall just high enough to see  over, while a fair margin of shrubs in either garden afforded us  additional protection.
  Thus entrenched, we had stood an hour, watching  a pair of lighted bow-windows with vague shadows flitting continually  across the blinds, and listening to the drawing of corks, the clink of  glasses, and a gradual crescendo of coarse voices within.
  Our luck  seemed to have deserted us: the owner of the purple diamonds was dining  at home and dining at undue length.
  I thought it was a dinner-party.
  Raffles differed; in the end he proved right.
  Wheels grated in the  drive, a carriage and pair stood at the steps; there was a stampede  from the dining-room, and the loud voices died away, to burst forth  presently from the porch.
    Let me make our position perfectly clear.
  We were over the wall, at  the side of the house, but a few feet from the dining-room windows.
  On  our right, one angle of the building cut the back lawn in two  diagonally; on our left, another angle just permitted us to see the  jutting steps and the waiting carriage.
  We saw Rosenthall come  out--saw the glimmer of his diamonds before anything.
 Then came the  pugilist; then a lady with a head of hair like a bath sponge; then  another, and the party was complete.
    Raffles ducked and pulled me down in great excitement.
    "The ladies are going with them," he whispered.
  "This is great!"    "That's better still.
"    "The Gardenia!" the millionaire had bawled.
    "And that's best of all," said Raffles, standing upright as hoofs and  wheels crunched through the gates and rattled off at a fine speed.
    "Now what?" I whispered, trembling with excitement.
    "They'll be clearing away.
  Yes, here come their shadows.
  The  drawing-room windows open on the lawn.
  Bunny, it's the psychological  moment.
 Where's that mask?"    I produced it with a hand whose trembling I tried in vain to still, and  could have died for Raffles when he made no comment on what he could  not fail to notice.
  His own hands were firm and cool as he adjusted my  mask for me, and then his own.
    "By Jove, old boy," he whispered cheerily, "you look about the greatest  ruffian I ever saw! These masks alone will down a nigger, if we meet  one.
  But I'm glad I remembered to tell you not to shave.
  You'll pass  for Whitechapel if the worst comes to the worst and you don't forget to  talk the lingo.
  Better sulk like a mule if you're not sure of it, and  leave the dialogue to me; but, please our stars, there will be no need.
  Now, are you ready?"    "Quite.
"    "Got your gag?"    "Yes.
"    "Shooter?"    "Yes.
"    "Then follow me.
"    In an instant we were over the wall, in another on the lawn behind the  house.
  There was no moon.
 The very stars in their courses had veiled  themselves for our benefit.
  I crept at my leader's heels to some  French windows opening upon a shallow veranda.
  He pushed.
  They  yielded.
    "Luck again," he whispered; "nothing BUT luck! Now for a light.
"    And the light came!    A good score of electric burners glowed red for the fraction of a  second, then rained merciless white beams into our blinded eyes.
  When  we found our sight four revolvers covered us, and between two of them  the colossal frame of Reuben Rosenthall shook with a wheezy laughter  from head to foot.
    "Good-evening, boys," he hiccoughed.
  "Glad to see ye at last.
  Shift  foot or finger, you on the left, though, and you're a dead boy.
  I mean  you, you greaser!" he roared out at Raffles.
  "I know you.
  I've been  waitin' for you.
  I've been WATCHIN' you all this week!  Plucky smart  you thought yerself, didn't you?  One day beggin', next time shammin'  tight, and next one o' them old pals from Kimberley what never come  when I'm in.
  But you left the same tracks every day, you buggins, an'  the same tracks every night, all round the blessed premises.
"    "All right, guv'nor," drawled Raffles; "don't excite.
  It's a fair cop.
  We don't sweat to know 'ow you brung it orf.
  On'y don't you go for to  shoot, 'cos we 'int awmed, s'help me Gord!"    "Ah, you're a knowin' one," said Rosenthall, fingering his triggers.
  "But you've struck a knowin'er.
"    "Ho, yuss, we know all abaht thet!  Set a thief to ketch a thief--ho,  yuss.
"    My eyes had torn themselves from the round black muzzles, from the  accursed diamonds that had been our snare, the pasty pig-face of the  over-fed pugilist, and the flaming cheeks and hook nose of Rosenthall  himself.
  I was looking beyond them at the doorway filled with  quivering silk and plush, black faces, white eyeballs, woolly pates.
  But a sudden silence recalled my attention to the millionaire.
  And  only his nose retained its color.
    "What d'ye mean?" he whispered with a hoarse oath.
  "Spit it out, or,  by Christmas, I'll drill you!"    "Whort price thet brikewater?" drawled Raffles coolly.
    "Eh?"    Rosenthall's revolvers were describing widening orbits.
    "Whort price thet brikewater--old _I.
D.
B.
_?"    "Where in hell did you get hold o' that?" asked Rosenthall, with a  rattle in his thick neck, meant for mirth.
    "You may well arst," says Raffles.
  "It's all over the plice w'ere _I_  come from.
"    "Who can have spread such rot?"    "I dunno," says Raffles; "arst the gen'leman on yer left; p'r'aps 'E  knows.
"    The gentleman on his left had turned livid with emotion.
  Guilty  conscience never declared itself in plainer terms.
  For a moment his  small eyes bulged like currants in the suet of his face; the next, he  had pocketed his pistols on a professional instinct, and was upon us  with his fists.
    "Out o' the light--out o' the light!" yelled Rosenthall in a frenzy.
    He was too late.
  No sooner had the burly pugilist obstructed his fire  than Raffles was through the window at a bound; while I, for standing  still and saying nothing, was scientifically felled to the floor.
      I cannot have been many moments without my senses.
  When I recovered  them there was a great to-do in the garden, but I had the drawing-room  to myself.
  I sat up.
  Rosenthall and Purvis were rushing about  outside, cursing the Kaffirs and nagging at each other.
    "Over THAT wall, I tell yer!"    "I tell you it was this one.
  Can't you whistle for the police?"    "Police be damned!  I've had enough of the blessed police.
"    "Then we'd better get back and make sure of the other rotter.
"    "Oh, make sure o' yer skin.
  That's what you'd better do.
  Jala, you  black hog, if I catch YOU skulkin'.
.
.
.
"    I never heard the threat.
  I was creeping from the drawing-room on my  hands and knees, my own revolver swinging by its steel ring from my  teeth.
    For an instant I thought that the hall also was deserted.
  I was wrong,  and I crept upon a Kaffir on all fours.
  Poor devil, I could not bring  myself to deal him a base blow, but I threatened him most hideously  with my revolver, and left the white teeth chattering in his black head  as I took the stairs three at a time.
  Why I went upstairs in that  decisive fashion, as though it were my only course, I cannot explain.
  But garden and ground floor seemed alive with men, and I might have  done worse.
    I turned into the first room I came to.
  It was a bedroom--empty,  though lit up; and never shall I forget how I started as I entered, on  encountering the awful villain that was myself at full length in a  pier-glass!  Masked, armed, and ragged, I was indeed fit carrion for a  bullet or the hangman, and to one or the other I made up my mind.
  Nevertheless, I hid myself in the wardrobe behind the mirror; and there  I stood shivering and cursing my fate, my folly, and Raffles most of  all--Raffles first and last--for I daresay half an hour.
  Then the  wardrobe door was flung suddenly open; they had stolen into the room  without a sound; and I was hauled downstairs, an ignominious captive.
    Gross scenes followed in the hall; the ladies were now upon the stage,  and at sight of the desperate criminal they screamed with one accord.
  In truth I must have given them fair cause, though my mask was now torn  away and hid nothing but my left ear.
  Rosenthall answered their  shrieks with a roar for silence; the woman with the bath-sponge hair  swore at him shrilly in return; the place became a Babel impossible to  describe.
  I remember wondering how long it would be before the police  appeared.
  Purvis and the ladies were for calling them in and giving me  in charge without delay.
  Rosenthall would not hear of it.
  He swore  that he would shoot man or woman who left his sight.
  He had had enough  of the police.
  He was not going to have them coming there to spoil  sport; he was going to deal with me in his own way.
  With that he  dragged me from all other hands, flung me against a door, and sent a  bullet crashing through the wood within an inch of my ear.
    "You drunken fool!  It'll be murder!" shouted Purvis, getting in the  way a second time.
    "Wha' do I care?  He's armed, isn't he?  I shot him in self-defence.
  It'll be a warning to others.
  Will you stand aside, or d'ye want it  yourself?"    "You're drunk," said Purvis, still between us.
 "I saw you take a neat  tumblerful since you come in, and it's made you drunk as a fool.
  Pull  yourself together, old man.
  You ain't a-going to do what you'll be  sorry for.
"    "Then I won't shoot at him, I'll only shoot roun' an' roun' the beggar.
  You're quite right, ole feller.
  Wouldn't hurt him.
  Great mishtake.
  Roun' an' roun'.
  There--like that!"    His freckled paw shot up over Purvis's shoulder, mauve lightning came  from his ring, a red flash from his revolver, and shrieks from the  women as the reverberations died away.
  Some splinters lodged in my  hair.
    Next instant the prize-fighter disarmed him; and I was safe from the  devil, but finally doomed to the deep sea.
  A policeman was in our  midst.
 He had entered through the drawing-room window; he was an  officer of few words and creditable promptitude.
  In a twinkling he had  the handcuffs on my wrists, while the pugilist explained the situation,  and his patron reviled the force and its representative with impotent  malignity.
  A fine watch they kept; a lot of good they did; coming in  when all was over and the whole household might have been murdered in  their sleep.
  The officer only deigned to notice him as he marched me  off.
    "We know all about YOU, sir," said he contemptuously, and he refused  the sovereign Purvis proffered.
  "You will be seeing me again, sir, at  Marylebone.
"    "Shall I come now?"    "As you please, sir.
  I rather think the other gentleman requires you  more, and I don't fancy this young man means to give much trouble.
"    "Oh, I'm coming quietly," I said.
    And I went.
    In silence we traversed perhaps a hundred yards.
 It must have been  midnight.
  We did not meet a soul.
  At last I whispered:    "How on earth did you manage it?"    "Purely by luck," said Raffles.
  "I had the luck to get clear away  through knowing every brick of those back-garden walls, and the double  luck to have these togs with the rest over at Chelsea.
  The helmet is  one of a collection I made up at Oxford; here it goes over this wall,  and we'd better carry the coat and belt before we meet a real officer.
  I got them once for a fancy ball--ostensibly--and thereby hangs a yarn.
  I always thought they might come in useful a second time.
  My chief  crux to-night was getting rid of the hansom that brought me back.
  I  sent him off to Scotland Yard with ten bob and a special message to  good old Mackenzie.
  The whole detective department will be at  Rosenthall's in about half an hour.
  Of course, I speculated on our  gentleman's hatred of the police--another huge slice of luck.
  If you'd  got away, well and good; if not, I felt he was the man to play with his  mouse as long as possible.
 Yes, Bunny, it's been more of a costume  piece than I intended, and we've come out of it with a good deal less  credit.
  But, by Jove, we're jolly lucky to have come out of it at all!"        GENTLEMEN AND PLAYERS    Old Raffles may or may not have been an exceptional criminal, but as a  cricketer I dare swear he was unique.
  Himself a dangerous bat, a  brilliant field, and perhaps the very finest slow bowler of his decade,  he took incredibly little interest in the game at large.
  He never went  up to Lord's without his cricket-bag, or showed the slightest interest  in the result of a match in which he was not himself engaged.
  Nor was  this mere hateful egotism on his part.
  He professed to have lost all  enthusiasm for the game, and to keep it up only from the very lowest  motives.
    "Cricket," said Raffles, "like everything else, is good enough sport  until you discover a better.
  As a source of excitement it isn't in it  with other things you wot of, Bunny, and the involuntary comparison  becomes a bore.
  What's the satisfaction of taking a man's wicket when  you want his spoons?  Still, if you can bowl a bit your low cunning  won't get rusty, and always looking for the weak spot's just the kind  of mental exercise one wants.
  Yes, perhaps there's some affinity  between the two things after all.
  But I'd chuck up cricket to-morrow,  Bunny, if it wasn't for the glorious protection it affords a person of  my proclivities.
"    "How so?" said I.
  "It brings you before the public, I should have  thought, far more than is either safe or wise.
"    "My dear Bunny, that's exactly where you make a mistake.
  To follow  Crime with reasonable impunity you simply MUST have a parallel,  ostensible career--the more public the better.
  The principle is  obvious.
  Mr. Peace, of pious memory, disarmed suspicion by acquiring a  local reputation for playing the fiddle and taming animals, and it's my  profound conviction that Jack the Ripper was a really eminent public  man, whose speeches were very likely reported alongside his atrocities.
  Fill the bill in some prominent part, and you'll never be suspected of  doubling it with another of equal prominence.
  That's why I want you to  cultivate journalism, my boy, and sign all you can.
  And it's the one  and only reason why I don't burn my bats for firewood.
"    Nevertheless, when he did play there was no keener performer on the  field, nor one more anxious to do well for his side.
  I remember how he  went to the nets, before the first match of the season, with his pocket  full of sovereigns, which he put on the stumps instead of bails.
  It  was a sight to see the professionals bowling like demons for the hard  cash, for whenever a stump was hit a pound was tossed to the bowler and  another balanced in its stead, while one man took #3 with a ball that  spreadeagled the wicket.
  Raffles's practice cost him either eight or  nine sovereigns; but he had absolutely first-class bowling all the  time; and he made fifty-seven runs next day.
    It became my pleasure to accompany him to all his matches, to watch  every ball he bowled, or played, or fielded, and to sit chatting with  him in the pavilion when he was doing none of these three things.
  You  might have seen us there, side by side, during the greater part of the  Gentlemen's first innings against the Players (who had lost the toss)  on the second Monday in July.
  We were to be seen, but not heard, for  Raffles had failed to score, and was uncommonly cross for a player who  cared so little for the game.
  Merely taciturn with me, he was  positively rude to more than one member who wanted to know how it had  happened, or who ventured to commiserate him on his luck; there he sat,  with a straw hat tilted over his nose and a cigarette stuck between  lips that curled disagreeably at every advance.
  I was therefore much  surprised when a young fellow of the exquisite type came and squeezed  himself in between us, and met with a perfectly civil reception despite  the liberty.
  I did not know the boy by sight, nor did Raffles  introduce us; but their conversation proclaimed at once a slightness of  acquaintanceship and a license on the lad's part which combined to  puzzle me.
  Mystification reached its height when Raffles was informed  that the other's father was anxious to meet him, and he instantly  consented to gratify that whim.
    "He's in the Ladies' Enclosure.
  Will you come round now?"    "With pleasure," says Raffles.
  "Keep a place for me, Bunny.
"    And they were gone.
    "Young Crowley," said some voice further back.
  "Last year's Harrow  Eleven.
"    "I remember him.
  Worst man in the team.
"    "Keen cricketer, however.
  Stopped till he was twenty to get his  colors.
  Governor made him.
  Keen breed.
  Oh, pretty, sir!  Very  pretty!"    The game was boring me.
  I only came to see old Raffles perform.
  Soon  I was looking wistfully for his return, and at length I saw him  beckoning me from the palings to the right.
    "Want to introduce you to old Amersteth," he whispered, when I joined  him.
  "They've a cricket week next month, when this boy Crowley comes  of age, and we've both got to go down and play.
"    "Both!" I echoed.
  "But I'm no cricketer!"    "Shut up," says Raffles.
  "Leave that to me.
 I've been lying for all  I'm worth," he added sepulchrally as we reached the bottom of the  steps.
 "I trust to you not to give the show away.
"    There was a gleam in his eye that I knew well enough elsewhere, but was  unprepared for in those healthy, sane surroundings; and it was with  very definite misgivings and surmises that I followed the Zingari  blazer through the vast flower-bed of hats and bonnets that bloomed  beneath the ladies' awning.
    Lord Amersteth was a fine-looking man with a short mustache and a  double chin.
  He received me with much dry courtesy, through which,  however, it was not difficult to read a less flattering tale.
  I was  accepted as the inevitable appendage of the invaluable Raffles, with  whom I felt deeply incensed as I made my bow.
    "I have been bold enough," said Lord Amersteth, "to ask one of the  Gentlemen of England to come down and play some rustic cricket for us  next month.
  He is kind enough to say that he would have liked nothing  better, but for this little fishing expedition of yours, Mr.-----,  Mr.-----," and Lord Amersteth succeeded in remembering my name.
    It was, of course, the first I had ever heard of that fishing  expedition, but I made haste to say that it could easily, and should  certainly, be put off.
  Raffles gleamed approval through his eyelashes.
  Lord Amersteth bowed and shrugged.
    "You're very good, I'm sure," said he.
  "But I understand you're a  cricketer yourself?"    "He was one at school," said Raffles, with infamous readiness.
    "Not a real cricketer," I was stammering meanwhile.
    "In the eleven?" said Lord Amersteth.
    "I'm afraid not," said I.
    "But only just out of it," declared Raffles, to my horror.
    "Well, well, we can't all play for the Gentlemen," said Lord Amersteth  slyly.
  "My son Crowley only just scraped into the eleven at Harrow,  and HE'S going to play.
  I may even come in myself at a pinch; so you  won't be the only duffer, if you are one, and I shall be very glad if  you will come down and help us too.
  You shall flog a stream before  breakfast and after dinner, if you like.
"    "I should be very proud," I was beginning, as the mere prelude to  resolute excuses; but the eye of Raffles opened wide upon me; and I  hesitated weakly, to be duly lost.
    "Then that's settled," said Lord Amersteth, with the slightest  suspicion of grimness.
  "It's to be a little week, you know, when my  son comes of age.
  We play the Free Foresters, the Dorsetshire  Gentlemen, and probably some local lot as well.
 But Mr. Raffles will  tell you all about it, and Crowley shall write.
  Another wicket!  By  Jove, they're all out!  Then I rely on you both.
" And, with a little  nod, Lord Amersteth rose and sidled to the gangway.
    Raffles rose also, but I caught the sleeve of his blazer.
    "What are you thinking of?" I whispered savagely.
  "I was nowhere near  the eleven.
  I'm no sort of cricketer.
  I shall have to get out of  this!"    "Not you," he whispered back.
  "You needn't play, but come you must.
  If you wait for me after half-past six I'll tell you why.
"    But I could guess the reason; and I am ashamed to say that it revolted  me much less than did the notion of making a public fool of myself on a  cricket-field.
  My gorge rose at this as it no longer rose at crime,  and it was in no tranquil humor that I strolled about the ground while  Raffles disappeared in the pavilion.
  Nor was my annoyance lessened by  a little meeting I witnessed between young Crowley and his father, who  shrugged as he stopped and stooped to convey some information which  made the young man look a little blank.
 It may have been pure  self-consciousness on my part, but I could have sworn that the trouble  was their inability to secure the great Raffles without his  insignificant friend.
    Then the bell rang, and I climbed to the top of the pavilion to watch  Raffles bowl.
  No subtleties are lost up there; and if ever a bowler  was full of them, it was A.
 J.
 Raffles on this day, as, indeed, all the  cricket world remembers.
  One had not to be a cricketer oneself to  appreciate his perfect command of pitch and break, his beautifully easy  action, which never varied with the varying pace, his great ball on the  leg-stump--his dropping head-ball--in a word, the infinite ingenuity of  that versatile attack.
  It was no mere exhibition of athletic prowess,  it was an intellectual treat, and one with a special significance in my  eyes.
  I saw the "affinity between the two things," saw it in that  afternoon's tireless warfare against the flower of professional  cricket.
  It was not that Raffles took many wickets for few runs; he  was too fine a bowler to mind being hit; and time was short, and the  wicket good.
  What I admired, and what I remember, was the combination  of resource and cunning, of patience and precision, of head-work and  handiwork, which made every over an artistic whole.
  It was all so  characteristic of that other Raffles whom I alone knew!    "I felt like bowling this afternoon," he told me later in the hansom.
  "With a pitch to help me, I'd have done something big; as it is, three  for forty-one, out of the four that fell, isn't so bad for a slow  bowler on a plumb wicket against those fellows.
  But I felt venomous!  Nothing riles me more than being asked about for my cricket as though I  were a pro.
 myself.
"    "Then why on earth go?"    "To punish them, and--because we shall be jolly hard up, Bunny, before  the season's over!"    "Ah!" said I.
  "I thought it was that.
"    "Of course, it was!  It seems they're going to have the very devil of a  week of it--balls--dinner parties--swagger house party--general  junketings--and obviously a houseful of diamonds as well.
  Diamonds  galore!  As a general rule nothing would induce me to abuse my position  as a guest.
  I've never done it, Bunny.
  But in this case we're engaged  like the waiters and the band, and by heaven we'll take our toll!  Let's have a quiet dinner somewhere and talk it over.
"    "It seems rather a vulgar sort of theft," I could not help saying; and  to this, my single protest, Raffles instantly assented.
    "It is a vulgar sort," said he; "but I can't help that.
  We're getting  vulgarly hard up again, and there's an end on 't.
  Besides, these  people deserve it, and can afford it.
  And don't you run away with the  idea that all will be plain sailing; nothing will be easier than  getting some stuff, and nothing harder than avoiding all suspicion, as,  of course, we must.
  We may come away with no more than a good working  plan of the premises.
  Who knows?  In any case there's weeks of  thinking in it for you and me.
"    But with those weeks I will not weary you further than by remarking  that the "thinking," was done entirely by Raffles, who did not always  trouble to communicate his thoughts to me.
  His reticence, however, was  no longer an irritant.
  I began to accept it as a necessary convention  of these little enterprises.
  And, after our last adventure of the  kind, more especially after its denouement, my trust in Raffles was  much too solid to be shaken by a want of trust in me, which I still  believe to have been more the instinct of the criminal than the  judgment of the man.
    It was on Monday, the tenth of August, that we were due at Milchester  Abbey, Dorset; and the beginning of the month found us cruising about  that very county, with fly-rods actually in our hands.
  The idea was  that we should acquire at once a local reputation as decent fishermen,  and some knowledge of the countryside, with a view to further and more  deliberate operations in the event of an unprofitable week.
  There was  another idea which Raffles kept to himself until he had got me down  there.
  Then one day he produced a cricket-ball in a meadow we were  crossing, and threw me catches for an hour together.
  More hours he  spent in bowling to me on the nearest green; and, if I was never a  cricketer, at least I came nearer to being one, by the end of that  week, than ever before or since.
    Incident began early on the Monday.
  We had sallied forth from a  desolate little junction within quite a few miles of Milchester, had  been caught in a shower, had run for shelter to a wayside inn.
 A  florid, overdressed man was drinking in the parlor, and I could have  sworn it was at the sight of him that Raffles recoiled on the  threshold, and afterwards insisted on returning to the station through  the rain.
  He assured me, however, that the odor of stale ale had  almost knocked him down.
  And I had to make what I could of his  speculative, downcast eyes and knitted brows.
    Milchester Abbey is a gray, quadrangular pile, deep-set in rich woody  country, and twinkling with triple rows of quaint windows, every one of  which seemed alight as we drove up just in time to dress for dinner.
  The carriage had whirled us under I know not how many triumphal arches  in process of construction, and past the tents and flag-poles of a  juicy-looking cricket-field, on which Raffles undertook to bowl up to  his reputation.
  But the chief signs of festival were within, where we  found an enormous house-party assembled, including more persons of  pomp, majesty, and dominion than I had ever encountered in one room  before.
  I confess I felt overpowered.
  Our errand and my own presences  combined to rob me of an address upon which I have sometimes plumed  myself; and I have a grim recollection of my nervous relief when dinner  was at last announced.
  I little knew what an ordeal it was to prove.
    I had taken in a much less formidable young lady than might have fallen  to my lot.
  Indeed I began by blessing my good fortune in this respect.
  Miss Melhuish was merely the rector's daughter, and she had only been  asked to make an even number.
  She informed me of both facts before the  soup reached us, and her subsequent conversation was characterized by  the same engaging candor.
 It exposed what was little short of a mania  for imparting information.
  I had simply to listen, to nod, and to be  thankful.
    When I confessed to knowing very few of those present, even by sight,  my entertaining companion proceeded to tell me who everybody was,  beginning on my left and working conscientiously round to her right.
  This lasted quite a long time, and really interested me; but a great  deal that followed did not, and, obviously to recapture my unworthy  attention, Miss Melhuish suddenly asked me, in a sensational whisper,  whether I could keep a secret.
    I said I thought I might, whereupon another question followed, in still  lower and more thrilling accents:    "Are you afraid of burglars?"    Burglars!  I was roused at last.
  The word stabbed me.
  I repeated it  in horrified query.
    "So I've found something to interest you at last!" said Miss Melhuish,  in naive triumph.
 "Yes--burglars!  But don't speak so loud.
  It's  supposed to be kept a great secret.
  I really oughtn't to tell you at  all!"    "But what is there to tell?" I whispered with satisfactory impatience.
    "You promise not to speak of it?"    "Of course!"    "Well, then, there are burglars in the neighborhood.
"    "Have they committed any robberies?"    "Not yet.
"    "Then how do you know?"    "They've been seen.
  In the district.
  Two well-known London thieves!"    Two!  I looked at Raffles.
  I had done so often during the evening,  envying him his high spirits, his iron nerve, his buoyant wit, his  perfect ease and self-possession.
  But now I pitied him; through all my  own terror and consternation, I pitied him as he sat eating and  drinking, and laughing and talking, without a cloud of fear or of  embarrassment on his handsome, taking, daredevil face.
  I caught up my  champagne and emptied the glass.
    "Who has seen them?" I then asked calmly.
    "A detective.
  They were traced down from town a few days ago.
  They  are believed to have designs on the Abbey!"    "But why aren't they run in?"    "Exactly what I asked papa on the way here this evening; he says there  is no warrant out against the men at present, and all that can be done  is to watch their movements.
"    "Oh! so they are being watched?"    "Yes, by a detective who is down here on purpose.
  And I heard Lord  Amersteth tell papa that they had been seen this afternoon at Warbeck  Junction!"    The very place where Raffles and I had been caught in the rain!  Our  stampede from the inn was now explained; on the other hand, I was no  longer to be taken by surprise by anything that my companion might have  to tell me; and I succeeded in looking her in the face with a smile.
    "This is really quite exciting, Miss Melhuish," said I.
  "May I ask how  you come to know so much about it?"    "It's papa," was the confidential reply.
  "Lord Amersteth consulted  him, and he consulted me.
 But for goodness' sake don't let it get  about!  I can't think WHAT tempted me to tell you!"    "You may trust me, Miss Melhuish.
  But--aren't you frightened?"    Miss Melhuish giggled.
    "Not a bit!  They won't come to the rectory.
 There's nothing for them  there.
  But look round the table: look at the diamonds: look at old  Lady Melrose's necklace alone!"    The Dowager Marchioness of Melrose was one of the few persons whom it  had been unnecessary to point out to me.
  She sat on Lord Amersteth's  right, flourishing her ear-trumpet, and drinking champagne with her  usual notorious freedom, as dissipated and kindly a dame as the world  has ever seen.
  It was a necklace of diamonds and sapphires that rose  and fell about her ample neck.
    "They say it's worth five thousand pounds at least," continued my  companion.
  "Lady Margaret told me so this morning (that's Lady  Margaret next your Mr. Raffles, you know); and the old dear WILL wear  them every night.
  Think what a haul they would be!  No; we don't feel  in immediate danger at the rectory.
"    When the ladies rose, Miss Melhuish bound me to fresh vows of secrecy;  and left me, I should think, with some remorse for her indiscretion,  but more satisfaction at the importance which it had undoubtedly given  her in my eyes.
  The opinion may smack of vanity, though, in reality,  the very springs of conversation reside in that same human, universal  itch to thrill the auditor.
  The peculiarity of Miss Melhuish was that  she must be thrilling at all costs.
  And thrilling she had surely been.
    I spare you my feelings of the next two hours.
 I tried hard to get a  word with Raffles, but again and again I failed.
  In the dining-room he  and Crowley lit their cigarettes with the same match, and had their  heads together all the time.
  In the drawing-room I had the  mortification of hearing him talk interminable nonsense into the  ear-trumpet of Lady Melrose, whom he knew in town.
  Lastly, in the  billiard-room, they had a great and lengthy pool, while I sat aloof and  chafed more than ever in the company of a very serious Scotchman, who  had arrived since dinner, and who would talk of nothing but the recent  improvements in instantaneous photography.
  He had not come to play in  the matches (he told me), but to obtain for Lord Amersteth such a  series of cricket photographs as had never been taken before; whether  as an amateur or a professional photographer I was unable to determine.
  I remember, however, seeking distraction in little bursts of resolute  attention to the conversation of this bore.
  And so at last the long  ordeal ended; glasses were emptied, men said good-night, and I followed  Raffles to his room.
    "It's all up!" I gasped, as he turned up the gas and I shut the door.
  "We're being watched.
 We've been followed down from town.
  There's a  detective here on the spot!"    "How do YOU know?" asked Raffles, turning upon me quite sharply, but  without the least dismay.
  And I told him how I knew.
    "Of course," I added, "it was the fellow we saw in the inn this  afternoon.
"    "The detective?" said Raffles.
  "Do you mean to say you don't know a  detective when you see one, Bunny?"    "If that wasn't the fellow, which is?"    Raffles shook his head.
    "To think that you've been talking to him for the last hour in the  billiard-room and couldn't spot what he was!"    "The Scotch photographer--"    I paused aghast.
    "Scotch he is," said Raffles, "and photographer he may be.
  He is also  Inspector Mackenzie of Scotland Yard--the very man I sent the message  to that night last April.
  And you couldn't spot who he was in a whole  hour! O Bunny, Bunny, you were never built for crime!"    "But," said I, "if that was Mackenzie, who was the fellow you bolted  from at Warbeck?"    "The man he's watching.
"    "But he's watching us!"    Raffles looked at me with a pitying eye, and shook his head again  before handing me his open cigarette-case.
    "I don't know whether smoking's forbidden in one's bedroom, but you'd  better take one of these and stand tight, Bunny, because I'm going to  say something offensive.
"    I helped myself with a laugh.
    "Say what you like, my dear fellow, if it really isn't you and I that  Mackenzie's after.
"    "Well, then, it isn't, and it couldn't be, and nobody but a born Bunny  would suppose for a moment that it was!  Do you seriously think he  would sit there and knowingly watch his man playing pool under his  nose?  Well, he might; he's a cool hand, Mackenzie; but I'm not cool  enough to win a pool under such conditions.
  At least I don't think I  am; it would be interesting to see.
  The situation wasn't free from  strain as it was, though I knew he wasn't thinking of us.
  Crowley told  me all about it after dinner, you see, and then I'd seen one of the men  for myself this afternoon.
 You thought it was a detective who made me  turn tail at that inn.
  I really don't know why I didn't tell you at  the time, but it was just the opposite.
 That loud, red-faced brute is  one of the cleverest thieves in London, and I once had a drink with him  and our mutual fence.
  I was an Eastender from tongue to toe at the  moment, but you will understand that I don't run unnecessary risks of  recognition by a brute like that.
"    "He's not alone, I hear.
"    "By no means; there's at least one other man with him; and it's  suggested that there may be an accomplice here in the house.
"    "Did Lord Crowley tell you so?"    "Crowley and the champagne between them.
  In confidence, of course,  just as your girl told you; but even in confidence he never let on  about Mackenzie.
  He told me there was a detective in the background,  but that was all.
  Putting him up as a guest is evidently their big  secret, to be kept from the other guests because it might offend them,  but more particularly from the servants whom he's here to watch.
  That's my reading of the situation, Bunny, and you will agree with me  that it's infinitely more interesting than we could have imagined it  would prove.
"    "But infinitely more difficult for us," said I, with a sigh of  pusillanimous relief.
  "Our hands are tied for this week, at all  events.
"    "Not necessarily, my dear Bunny, though I admit that the chances are  against us.
  Yet I'm not so sure of that either.
  There are all sorts  of possibilities in these three-cornered combinations.
  Set A to watch  B, and he won't have an eye left for C.
  That's the obvious theory, but  then Mackenzie's a very big A.
  I should be sorry to have any boodle  about me with that man in the house.
  Yet it would be great to nip in  between A and B and score off them both at once!  It would be worth a  risk, Bunny, to do that; it would be worth risking something merely to  take on old hands like B and his men at their own old game!  Eh, Bunny?  That would be something like a match.
 Gentlemen and Players at single  wicket, by Jove!"    His eyes were brighter than I had known them for many a day.
  They  shone with the perverted enthusiasm which was roused in him only by the  contemplation of some new audacity.
  He kicked off his shoes and began  pacing his room with noiseless rapidity; not since the night of the Old  Bohemian dinner to Reuben Rosenthall had Raffles exhibited such  excitement in my presence; and I was not sorry at the moment to be  reminded of the fiasco to which that banquet had been the prelude.
    "My dear A.
 J.
," said I in his very own tone, "you're far too fond of  the uphill game; you will eventually fall a victim to the sporting  spirit and nothing else.
  Take a lesson from our last escape, and fly  lower as you value our skins.
  Study the house as much as you like, but  do--not--go and shove your head into Mackenzie's mouth!"    My wealth of metaphor brought him to a stand-still, with his cigarette  between his fingers and a grin beneath his shining eyes.
    "You're quite right, Bunny.
  I won't.
  I really won't.
  Yet--you saw  old Lady Melrose's necklace?  I've been wanting it for years!  But I'm  not going to play the fool; honor bright, I'm not; yet--by Jove!--to  get to windward of the professors and Mackenzie too!  It would be a  great game, Bunny, it would be a great game!"    "Well, you mustn't play it this week.
"    "No, no, I won't.
  But I wonder how the professors think of going to  work?  That's what one wants to know.
  I wonder if they've really got  an accomplice in the house?  How I wish I knew their game!  But it's  all right, Bunny; don't you be jealous; it shall be as you wish.
"    And with that assurance I went off to my own room, and so to bed with  an incredibly light heart.
 I had still enough of the honest man in me  to welcome the postponement of our actual felonies, to dread their  performance, to deplore their necessity: which is merely another way of  stating the too patent fact that I was an incomparably weaker man than  Raffles, while every whit as wicked.
    I had, however, one rather strong point.
  I possessed the gift of  dismissing unpleasant considerations, not intimately connected with the  passing moment, entirely from my mind.
  Through the exercise of this  faculty I had lately been living my frivolous life in town with as much  ignoble enjoyment as I had derived from it the year before; and  similarly, here at Milchester, in the long-dreaded cricket-week, I had  after all a quite excellent time.
    It is true that there were other factors in this pleasing  disappointment.
  In the first place, mirabile dictu, there were one or  two even greater duffers than I on the Abbey cricket-field.
  Indeed,  quite early in the week, when it was of most value to me, I gained  considerable kudos for a lucky catch; a ball, of which I had merely  heard the hum, stuck fast in my hand, which Lord Amersteth himself  grasped in public congratulation.
  This happy accident was not to be  undone even by me, and, as nothing succeeds like success, and the  constant encouragement of the one great cricketer on the field was in  itself an immense stimulus, I actually made a run or two in my very  next innings.
  Miss Melhuish said pretty things to me that night at the  great ball in honor of Viscount Crowley's majority; she also told me  that was the night on which the robbers would assuredly make their  raid, and was full of arch tremors when we sat out in the garden,  though the entire premises were illuminated all night long.
  Meanwhile  the quiet Scotchman took countless photographs by day, which he  developed by night in a dark room admirably situated in the servants'  part of the house; and it is my firm belief that only two of his  fellow-guests knew Mr. Clephane of Dundee for Inspector Mackenzie of  Scotland Yard.
    The week was to end with a trumpery match on the Saturday, which two or  three of us intended abandoning early in order to return to town that  night.
  The match, however, was never played.
  In the small hours of  the Saturday morning a tragedy took place at Milchester Abbey.
    Let me tell of the thing as I saw and heard it.
  My room opened upon  the central gallery, and was not even on the same floor as that on  which Raffles--and I think all the other men--were quartered.
  I had  been put, in fact, into the dressing-room of one of the grand suites,  and my too near neighbors were old Lady Melrose and my host and  hostess.
  Now, by the Friday evening the actual festivities were at an  end, and, for the first time that week, I must have been sound asleep  since midnight, when all at once I found myself sitting up breathless.
  A heavy thud had come against my door, and now I heard hard breathing  and the dull stamp of muffled feet.
    "I've got ye," muttered a voice.
  "It's no use struggling.
"    It was the Scotch detective, and a new fear turned me cold.
  There was  no reply, but the hard breathing grew harder still, and the muffled  feet beat the floor to a quicker measure.
  In sudden panic I sprang out  of bed and flung open my door.
 A light burnt low on the landing, and by  it I could see Mackenzie swaying and staggering in a silent tussle with  some powerful adversary.
    "Hold this man!" he cried, as I appeared.
 "Hold the rascal!"    But I stood like a fool until the pair of them backed into me, when,  with a deep breath I flung myself on the fellow, whose face I had seen  at last.
 He was one of the footmen who waited at table; and no sooner  had I pinned him than the detective loosed his hold.
    "Hang on to him," he cried.
  "There's more of 'em below.
"    And he went leaping down the stairs, as other doors opened and Lord  Amersteth and his son appeared simultaneously in their pyjamas.
  At  that my man ceased struggling; but I was still holding him when Crowley  turned up the gas.
    "What the devil's all this?" asked Lord Amersteth, blinking.
  "Who was  that ran downstairs?"    "Mac--Clephane!" said I hastily.
    "Aha!" said he, turning to the footman.
  "So you're the scoundrel, are  you?  Well done!  Well done!  Where was he caught?"    I had no idea.
    "Here's Lady Melrose's door open," said Crowley.
  "Lady Melrose!  Lady  Melrose!"    "You forget she's deaf," said Lord Amersteth.
 "Ah! that'll be her maid.
"    An inner door had opened; next instant there was a little shriek, and a  white figure gesticulated on the threshold.
    "Ou donc est l'ecrin de Madame la Marquise?  La fenetre est ouverte.
  Il a disparu!"    "Window open and jewel-case gone, by Jove!" exclaimed Lord Amersteth.
  "Mais comment est Madame la Marquise?  Est elle bien?"    "Oui, milor.
  Elle dort.
"    "Sleeps through it all," said my lord.
  "She's the only one, then!"    "What made Mackenzie--Clephane--bolt?" young Crowley asked me.
    "Said there were more of them below.
"    "Why the devil couldn't you tell us so before?" he cried, and went  leaping downstairs in his turn.
    He was followed by nearly all the cricketers, who now burst upon the  scene in a body, only to desert it for the chase.
  Raffles was one of  them, and I would gladly have been another, had not the footman chosen  this moment to hurl me from him, and to make a dash in the direction  from which they had come.
  Lord Amersteth had him in an instant; but  the fellow fought desperately, and it took the two of us to drag him  downstairs, amid a terrified chorus from half-open doors.
  Eventually  we handed him over to two other footmen who appeared with their  nightshirts tucked into their trousers, and my host was good enough to  compliment me as he led the way outside.
    "I thought I heard a shot," he added.
  "Didn't you?"    "I thought I heard three.
"    And out we dashed into the darkness.
    I remember how the gravel pricked my feet, how the wet grass numbed  them as we made for the sound of voices on an outlying lawn.
  So dark  was the night that we were in the cricketers' midst before we saw the  shimmer of their pyjamas; and then Lord Amersteth almost trod on  Mackenzie as he lay prostrate in the dew.
    "Who's this?" he cried.
  "What on earth's happened?"    "It's Clephane," said a man who knelt over him.
  "He's got a bullet in  him somewhere.
"    "Is he alive?"    "Barely.
"    "Good God!  Where's Crowley?"    "Here I am," called a breathless voice.
  "It's no good, you fellows.
  There's nothing to show which way they've gone.
  Here's Raffles; he's  chucked it, too.
"  And they ran up panting.
    "Well, we've got one of them, at all events," muttered Lord Amersteth.
  "The next thing is to get this poor fellow indoors.
  Take his  shoulders, somebody.
  Now his middle.
  Join hands under him.
  All  together, now; that's the way.
  Poor fellow!  Poor fellow!  His name  isn't Clephane at all.
  He's a Scotland Yard detective, down here for  these very villains!"    Raffles was the first to express surprise; but he had also been the  first to raise the wounded man.
  Nor had any of them a stronger or more  tender hand in the slow procession to the house.
    In a little we had the senseless man stretched on a sofa in the  library.
  And there, with ice on his wound and brandy in his throat,  his eyes opened and his lips moved.
    Lord Amersteth bent down to catch the words.
    "Yes, yes," said he; "we've got one of them safe and sound.
  The brute  you collared upstairs.
" Lord Amersteth bent lower.
  "By Jove!  Lowered  the jewel-case out of the window, did he?  And they've got clean away  with it!  Well, well!  I only hope we'll be able to pull this good  fellow through.
  He's off again.
"    An hour passed: the sun was rising.
    It found a dozen young fellows on the settees in the billiard-room,  drinking whiskey and soda-water in their overcoats and pyjamas, and  still talking excitedly in one breath.
  A time-table was being passed  from hand to hand: the doctor was still in the library.
  At last the  door opened, and Lord Amersteth put in his head.
    "It isn't hopeless," said he, "but it's bad enough.
 There'll be no  cricket to-day.
"    Another hour, and most of us were on our way to catch the early train;  between us we filled a compartment almost to suffocation.
  And still we  talked all together of the night's event; and still I was a little hero  in my way, for having kept my hold of the one ruffian who had been  taken; and my gratification was subtle and intense.
  Raffles watched me  under lowered lids.
  Not a word had we had together; not a word did we  have until we had left the others at Paddington, and were skimming  through the streets in a hansom with noiseless tires and a tinkling  bell.
    "Well, Bunny," said Raffles, "so the professors have it, eh?"    "Yes," said I.
  "And I'm jolly glad!"    "That poor Mackenzie has a ball in his chest?"    "That you and I have been on the decent side for once.
"    He shrugged his shoulders.
    "You're hopeless, Bunny, quite hopeless!  I take it you wouldn't have  refused your share if the boodle had fallen to us?  Yet you positively  enjoy coming off second best--for the second time running!  I confess,  however, that the professors' methods were full of interest to me.
  I,  for one, have probably gained as much in experience as I have lost in  other things.
  That lowering the jewel-case out of the window was a  very simple and effective expedient; two of them had been waiting below  for it for hours.
"    "How do you know?" I asked.
    "I saw them from my own window, which was just above the dear old  lady's.
  I was fretting for that necklace in particular, when I went up  to turn in for our last night--and I happened to look out of my window.
  In point of fact, I wanted to see whether the one below was open, and  whether there was the slightest chance of working the oracle with my  sheet for a rope.
  Of course I took the precaution of turning my light  off first, and it was a lucky thing I did.
  I saw the pros.
 right down  below, and they never saw me.
  I saw a little tiny luminous disk just  for an instant, and then again for an instant a few minutes later.
  Of  course I knew what it was, for I have my own watch-dial daubed with  luminous paint; it makes a lantern of sorts when you can get no better.
  But these fellows were not using theirs as a lantern.
  They were under  the old lady's window.
  They were watching the time.
  The whole thing  was arranged with their accomplice inside.
  Set a thief to catch a  thief: in a minute I had guessed what the whole thing proved to be.
"    "And you did nothing!" I exclaimed.
    "On the contrary, I went downstairs and straight into Lady Melrose's  room--"    "You did?"    "Without a moment's hesitation.
  To save her jewels.
  And I was  prepared to yell as much into her ear-trumpet for all the house to  hear.
  But the dear lady is too deaf and too fond of her dinner to wake  easily.
"    "Well?"    "She didn't stir.
"    "And yet you allowed the professors, as you call them, to take her  jewels, case and all!"    "All but this," said Raffles, thrusting his fist into my lap.
  "I would  have shown it you before, but really, old fellow, your face all day has  been worth a fortune to the firm!"    And he opened his fist, to shut it next instant on the bunch of  diamonds and of sapphires that I had last seen encircling the neck of  Lady Melrose.
        LE PREMIER PAS    That night he told me the story of his earliest crime.
  Not since the  fateful morning of the Ides of March, when he had just mentioned it as  an unreported incident of a certain cricket tour, had I succeeded in  getting a word out of Raffles on the subject.
  It was not for want of  trying; he would shake his head, and watch his cigarette smoke  thoughtfully; a subtle look in his eyes, half cynical, half wistful, as  though the decent honest days that were no more had had their merits  after all.
  Raffles would plan a fresh enormity, or glory in the last,  with the unmitigated enthusiasm of the artist.
  It was impossible to  imagine one throb or twitter of compunction beneath those frankly  egotistic and infectious transports.
  And yet the ghost of a dead  remorse seemed still to visit him with the memory of his first felony,  so that I had given the story up long before the night of our return  from Milchester.
  Cricket, however, was in the air, and Raffles's  cricket-bag back where he sometimes kept it, in the fender, with the  remains of an Orient label still adhering to the leather.
  My eyes had  been on this label for some time, and I suppose his eyes had been on  mine, for all at once he asked me if I still burned to hear that yarn.
    "It's no use," I replied.
  "You won't spin it.
 I must imagine it for  myself.
"    "How can you?"    "Oh, I begin to know your methods.
"    "You take it I went in with my eyes open, as I do now, eh?"    "I can't imagine your doing otherwise.
"    "My dear Bunny, it was the most unpremeditated thing I ever did in my  life!"    His chair wheeled back into the books as he sprang up with sudden  energy.
  There was quite an indignant glitter in his eyes.
    "I can't believe that," said I craftily.
  "I can't pay you such a poor  compliment!"    "Then you must be a fool--"    He broke off, stared hard at me, and in a trice stood smiling in his  own despite.
    "Or a better knave than I thought you, Bunny, and by Jove it's the  knave!  Well--I suppose I'm fairly drawn; I give you best, as they say  out there.
  As a matter of fact I've been thinking of the thing myself;  last night's racket reminds me of it in one or two respects.
  I tell  you what, though, this is an occasion in any case, and I'm going to  celebrate it by breaking the one good rule of my life.
  I'm going to  have a second drink!"    The whiskey tinkled, the syphon fizzed, the ice plopped home; and  seated there in his pyjamas, with the inevitable cigarette, Raffles  told me the story that I had given up hoping to hear.
  The windows were  wide open; the sounds of Piccadilly floated in at first.
  Long before  he finished, the last wheels had rattled, the last brawler was removed,  we alone broke the quiet of the summer night.
      ".
.
.
 No, they do you very well, indeed.
 You pay for nothing but drinks,  so to speak, but I'm afraid mine were of a comprehensive character.
  I  had started in a hole, I ought really to have refused the invitation;  then we all went to the Melbourne Cup, and I had the certain winner  that didn't win, and that's not the only way you can play the fool in  Melbourne.
  I wasn't the steady old stager I am now, Bunny; my analysis  was a confession in itself.
  But the others didn't know how hard up I  was, and I swore they shouldn't.
  I tried the Jews, but they're extra  fly out there.
 Then I thought of a kinsman of sorts, a second cousin of  my father's whom none of us knew anything about, except that he was  supposed to be in one or other of the Colonies.
  If he was a rich man,  well and good, I would work him; if not there would be no harm done.
  I  tried to get on his tracks, and, as luck would have it, I succeeded (or  thought I had) at the very moment when I happened to have a few days to  myself.
  I was cut over on the hand, just before the big Christmas  match, and couldn't have bowled a ball if they had played me.
    "The surgeon who fixed me up happened to ask me if I was any relation  of Raffles of the National Bank, and the pure luck of it almost took my  breath away.
  A relation who was a high official in one of the banks,  who would finance me on my mere name--could anything be better?  I made  up my mind that this Raffles was the man I wanted, and was awfully sold  to find next moment that he wasn't a high official at all.
  Nor had the  doctor so much as met him, but had merely read of him in connection  with a small sensation at the suburban branch which my namesake  managed; an armed robber had been rather pluckily beaten off, with a  bullet in him, by this Raffles; and the sort of thing was so common out  there that this was the first I had heard of it!  A suburban branch--my  financier had faded into some excellent fellow with a billet to lose if  he called his soul his own.
 Still a manager was a manager, and I said I  would soon see whether this was the relative I was looking for, if he  would be good enough to give me the name of that branch.
    "'I'll do more,' says the doctor.
  'I'll get you the name of the branch  he's been promoted to, for I think I heard they'd moved him up one  already.
' And the next day he brought me the name of the township of  Yea, some fifty miles north of Melbourne; but, with the vagueness which  characterized all his information, he was unable to say whether I  should find my relative there or not.
    "'He's a single man, and his initials are W.
 F.
,' said the doctor, who  was certain enough of the immaterial points.
  'He left his old post  several days ago, but it appears he's not due at the new one till the  New Year.
  No doubt he'll go before then to take things over and settle  in.
  You might find him up there and you might not.
  If I were you I  should write.
'    "'That'll lose two days,' said I, 'and more if he isn't there,' for I'd  grown quite keen on this up-country manager, and I felt that if I could  get at him while the holidays were still on, a little conviviality  might help matters considerably.
    "'Then,' said the doctor, 'I should get a quiet horse and ride.
  You  needn't use that hand.
'    "'Can't I go by train?'    "'You can and you can't.
  You would still have to ride.
  I suppose  you're a horseman?'    "'Yes.
'    "'Then I should certainly ride all the way.
  It's a delightful road,  through Whittlesea and over the Plenty Ranges.
  It'll give you some  idea of the bush, Mr. Raffles, and you'll see the sources of the water  supply of this city, sir.
  You'll see where every drop of it comes  from, the pure Yan Yean! I wish I had time to ride with you.
'    "'But where can I get a horse?'    "The doctor thought a moment.
    "'I've a mare of my own that's as fat as butter for want of work,' said  he.
  'It would be a charity to me to sit on her back for a hundred  miles or so, and then I should know you'd have no temptation to use  that hand.
'    "'You're far too good!' I protested.
    "'You're A.
 J.
 Raffles,' he said.
    "And if ever there was a prettier compliment, or a finer instance of  even Colonial hospitality, I can only say, Bunny, that I never heard of  either.
"    He sipped his whiskey, threw away the stump of  his cigarette, and lit  another before continuing.
    "Well, I managed to write a line to W.
 F.
 with my own hand, which, as  you will gather, was not very badly wounded; it was simply this third  finger that was split and in splints; and next morning the doctor  packed me off on a bovine beast that would have done for an ambulance.
  Half the team came up to see me start; the rest were rather sick with  me for not stopping to see the match out, as if I could help them to  win by watching them.
  They little knew the game I'd got on myself, but  still less did I know the game I was going to play.
    "It was an interesting ride enough, especially after passing the place  called Whittlesea, a real wild township on the lower slope of the  ranges, where I recollect having a deadly meal of hot mutton and tea,  with the thermometer at three figures in the shade.
  The first thirty  miles or so was a good metal road, too good to go half round the world  to ride on, but after Whittlesea it was a mere track over the ranges, a  track I often couldn't see and left entirely to the mare.
  Now it  dipped into a gully and ran through a creek, and all the time the local  color was inches thick; gum-trees galore and parrots all colors of the  rainbow.
  In one place a whole forest of gums had been ring-barked, and  were just as though they had been painted white, without a leaf or a  living thing for miles.
 And the first living thing I did meet was the  sort to give you the creeps; it was a riderless horse coming full tilt  through the bush, with the saddle twisted round and the stirrup-irons  ringing.
  Without thinking, I had a shot at heading him with the  doctor's mare, and blocked him just enough to allow a man who came  galloping after to do the rest.
    "'Thank ye, mister,' growled the man, a huge chap in a red checked  shirt, with a beard like W.
 G.
 Grace, but the very devil of an  expression.
    "'Been an accident?' said I, reining up.
    "'Yes,' said he, scowling as though he defied me to ask any more.
    "'And a nasty one,' I said, 'if that's blood on the saddle!'    "Well, Bunny, I may be a blackguard myself, but I don't think I ever  looked at a fellow as that chap looked at me.
  But I stared him out,  and forced him to admit that it was blood on the twisted saddle, and  after that he became quite tame.
  He told me exactly what had happened.
  A mate of his had been dragged under a branch, and had his nose  smashed, but that was all; had sat tight after it till he dropped from  loss of blood; another mate was with him back in the bush.
    "As I've said already, Bunny, I wasn't the old stager that I am now--in  any respect--and we parted good enough friends.
  He asked me which way  I was going, and, when I told him, he said I should save seven miles,  and get a good hour earlier to Yea, by striking off the track and  making for a peak that we could see through the trees, and following a  creek that I should see from the peak.
  Don't smile, Bunny!  I began by  saying I was a child in those days.
  Of course, the short cut was the  long way round; and it was nearly dark when that unlucky mare and I saw  the single street of Yea.
    "I was looking for the bank when a fellow in a white suit ran down from  the veranda.
    "'Mr. Raffles?' said he.
    "'Mr. Raffles,' said I, laughing as I shook his hand.
    "'You're late.
'    "'I was misdirected.
'    "'That all?  I'm relieved,' he said.
  'Do you know what they are  saying?  There are some brand-new bushrangers on the road between  Whittlesea and this--a second Kelly gang!  They'd have caught a Tartar  in you, eh?'    "'They would in you,' I retorted, and my tu quoque shut him up and  seemed to puzzle him.
 Yet there was much more sense in it than in his  compliment to me, which was absolutely pointless.
    "'I'm afraid you'll find things pretty rough,' he resumed, when he had  unstrapped my valise, and handed my reins to his man.
  'It's lucky  you're a bachelor like myself.
'    "I could not quite see the point of this remark either, since, had I  been married, I should hardly have sprung my wife upon him in this  free-and-easy fashion.
  I muttered the conventional sort of thing, and  then he said I should find it all right when I settled, as though I had  come to graze upon him for weeks!  'Well,' thought I, 'these Colonials  do take the cake for hospitality!'  And, still marvelling, I let him  lead me into the private part of the bank.
    "'Dinner will be ready in a quarter of an hour,' said he as we entered.
  'I thought you might like a tub first, and you'll find all ready in the  room at the end of the passage.
  Sing out if there's anything you want.
  Your luggage hasn't turned up yet, by the way, but here's a letter that  came this morning.
'    "'Not for me?'    "'Yes; didn't you expect one?'    "'I certainly did not!'    "'Well, here it is.
'    "And, as he lit me to my room, I read my own superscription of the  previous day--to W.
 F.
 Raffles!    "Bunny, you've had your wind bagged at footer, I daresay; you know what  that's like?  All I can say is that my moral wind was bagged by that  letter as I hope, old chap, I have never yet bagged yours.
 I couldn't  speak.
  I could only stand with my own letter in my hands until he had  the good taste to leave me by myself.
    "W.
 F.
 Raffles!  We had mistaken EACH OTHER for W.
 F.
  Raffles--for the  new manager who had not yet arrived!  Small wonder we had conversed at  cross-purposes; the only wonder was that we had not discovered our  mutual mistake.
  How the other man would have laughed!  But I--I could  not laugh.
  By Jove, no, it was no laughing matter for me!  I saw the  whole thing in a flash, without a tremor, but with the direst  depression from my own single point of view.
  Call it callous if you  like, Bunny, but remember that I was in much the same hole as you've  since been in yourself, and that I had counted on this W.
 F.
 Raffles  even as you counted on A.
 J.
  I thought of the man with the W.
 G.
  beard--the riderless horse and the bloody saddle--the deliberate  misdirection that had put me off the track and out of the way--and now  the missing manager and the report of bushrangers at this end.
  But I  simply don't pretend to have felt any personal pity for a man whom I  had never seen; that kind of pity's usually cant; and besides, all mine  was needed for myself.
    "I was in as big a hole as ever.
  What the devil was I to do?  I doubt  if I have sufficiently impressed upon you the absolute necessity of my  returning to Melbourne in funds.
  As a matter of fact it was less the  necessity than my own determination which I can truthfully ascribe as  absolute.
    "Money I would have--but how--but how?  Would this stranger be open to  persuasion--if I told him the truth?  No; that would set us all  scouring the country for the rest of the night.
  Why should I tell him?  Suppose I left him to find out his mistake .
.
.
 would anything be  gained?  Bunny, I give you my word that I went in to dinner without a  definite intention in my head, or one premeditated lie upon my lips.
  I  might do the decent, natural thing, and explain matters without loss of  time; on the other hand, there was no hurry.
  I had not opened the  letter, and could always pretend I had not noticed the initials;  meanwhile something might turn up.
  I could wait a little and see.
  Tempted I already was, but as yet the temptation was vague, and its  very vagueness made me tremble.
    "'Bad news, I'm afraid?' said the manager, when at last I sat down at  his table.
    "'A mere annoyance,' I answered--I do assure you--on the spur of the  moment and nothing else.
 But my lie was told; my position was taken;  from that moment onward there was no retreat.
  By implication, without  realizing what I was doing, I had already declared myself W.
 F.
  Raffles.
  Therefore, W.
 F.
 Raffles I would be, in that bank, for that  night.
  And the devil teach me how to use my lie!"    Again he raised his glass to his lips--I had forgotten mine.
  His  cigarette-case caught the gas-light as he handed it to me.
  I shook my  head without taking my eyes from his.
    "The devil played up," continued Raffles, with a laugh.
  "Before I  tasted my soup I had decided what to do.
  I had determined to rob that  bank instead of going to bed, and to be back in Melbourne for breakfast  if the doctor's mare could do it.
  I would tell the old fellow that I  had missed my way and been bushed for hours, as I easily might have  been, and had never got to Yea at all.
 At Yea, on the other hand, the  personation and robbery would ever after be attributed to a member of  the gang that had waylaid and murdered the new manager with that very  object.
  You are acquiring some experience in such matters, Bunny.
 I  ask you, was there ever a better get-out?  Last night's was something  like it, only never such a certainty.
  And I saw it from the  beginning--saw to the end before I had finished my soup!    "To increase my chances, the cashier, who also lived in the bank, was  away over the holidays, had actually gone down to Melbourne to see us  play; and the man who had taken my horse also waited at table; for he  and his wife were the only servants, and they slept in a separate  building.
  You may depend I ascertained this before we had finished  dinner.
  Indeed I was by way of asking too many questions (the most  oblique and delicate was that which elicited my host's name, Ewbank),  nor was I careful enough to conceal their drift.
    "'Do you know,' said this fellow Ewbank, who was one of the downright  sort, 'if it wasn't you, I should say you were in a funk of robbers?  Have you lost your nerve?'    "'I hope not,' said I, turning jolly hot, I can tell you; 'but--well,  it is not a pleasant thing to have to put a bullet through a fellow!'    "'No?' said he, coolly.
  'I should enjoy nothing better, myself;  besides, yours didn't go through.
'    "'I wish it had!' I was smart enough to cry.
    "'Amen!' said he.
    "And I emptied my glass; actually I did not know whether my wounded  bank-robber was in prison, dead, or at large!    "But, now that I had had more than enough of it, Ewbank would come back  to the subject.
  He admitted that the staff was small; but as for  himself, he had a loaded revolver under his pillow all night, under the  counter all day, and he was only waiting for his chance.
    "'Under the counter eh?' I was ass enough to say.
    "'Yes; so had you!'    "He was looking at me in surprise, and something told me that to say  'of course--I had forgotten!' would have been quite fatal, considering  what I was supposed to have done.
  So I looked down my nose and shook  my head.
    "'But the papers said you had!' he cried.
    "'Not under the counter," said I.
    "'But it's the regulation!'    "For the moment, Bunny, I felt stumped, though I trust I only looked  more superior than before, and I think I justified my look.
    "'The regulation!' I said at length, in the most offensive tone at my  command.
  'Yes, the regulation would have us all dead men!  My dear  sir, do you expect your bank robber to let you reach for your gun in  the place where he knows it's kept?  I had mine in my pocket, and I got  my chance by retreating from the counter with all visible reluctance.
'    "Ewbank stared at me with open eyes and a five-barred forehead, then  down came his fist on the table.
    "'By God!  That was smart!  Still,' he added, like a man who would not  be in the wrong, 'the papers said the other thing, you know!'    "'Of course,' I rejoined, 'because they said what I told them.
  You  wouldn't have had me advertise the fact that I improved upon the bank's  regulations, would you?'    "So that cloud rolled over, and by Jove it was a cloud with a golden  lining.
  Not silver--real good Australian gold!  For old Ewbank hadn't  quite appreciated me till then; he was a hard nut, a much older man  than myself, and I felt pretty sure he thought me young for the place,  and my supposed feat a fluke.
  But I never saw a man change his mind  more openly.
  He got out his best brandy, he made me throw away the  cigar I was smoking, and opened a fresh box.
  He was a  convivial-looking party, with a red moustache, and a very humorous face  (not unlike Tom Emmett's), and from that moment I laid myself out to  attack him on his convivial flank.
  But he wasn't a Rosenthall, Bunny;  he had a treble-seamed, hand-sewn head, and could have drunk me under  the table ten times over.
    "'All right,' I thought, 'you may go to bed sober, but you'll sleep  like a timber-yard!'  And I threw half he gave me through the open  window, when he wasn't looking.
    "But he was a good chap, Ewbank, and don't you imagine he was at all  intemperate.
  Convivial I called him, and I only wish he had been  something more.
  He did, however, become more and more genial as the  evening advanced, and I had not much difficulty in getting him to show  me round the bank at what was really an unearthly hour for such a  proceeding.
  It was when he went to fetch the revolver before turning  in.
  I kept him out of his bed another twenty minutes, and I knew every  inch of the business premises before I shook hands with Ewbank in my  room.
    "You won't guess what I did with myself for the next hour.
  I undressed  and went to bed.
  The incessant strain involved in even the most  deliberate impersonation is the most wearing thing I know; then how  much more so when the impersonation is impromptu!  There's no getting  your eye in; the next word may bowl you out; it's batting in a bad  light all through.
  I haven't told you of half the tight places I was  in during a conversation that ran into hours and became dangerously  intimate towards the end.
  You can imagine them for yourself, and then  picture me spread out on my bed, getting my second wind for the big  deed of the night.
    "Once more I was in luck, for I had not been lying there long before I  heard my dear Ewbank snoring like a harmonium, and the music never  ceased for a moment; it was as loud as ever when I crept out and closed  my door behind me, as regular as ever when I stopped to listen at his.
  And I have still to hear the concert that I shall enjoy much more.
  The  good fellow snored me out of the bank, and was still snoring when I  again stood and listened under his open window.
    "Why did I leave the bank first?  To catch and saddle the mare and  tether her in a clump of trees close by: to have the means of escape  nice and handy before I went to work.
  I have often wondered at the  instinctive wisdom of the precaution; unconsciously I was acting on  what has been one of my guiding principles ever since.
  Pains and  patience were required: I had to get my saddle without waking the man,  and I was not used to catching horses in a horse-paddock.
  Then I  distrusted the poor mare, and I went back to the stables for a hatful  of oats, which I left with her in the clump, hat and all.
  There was a  dog, too, to reckon with (our very worst enemy, Bunny); but I had been  'cute enough to make immense friends with him during the evening; and  he wagged his tail, not only when I came downstairs, but when I  reappeared at the back-door.
    "As the soi-disant new manager, I had been able, in the most ordinary  course, to pump poor Ewbank about anything and everything connected  with the working of the bank, especially in those twenty last  invaluable minutes before turning in.
  And I had made a very natural  point of asking him where he kept, and would recommend me to keep, the  keys at night.
  Of course I thought he would take them with him to his  room; but no such thing; he had a dodge worth two of that.
  What it was  doesn't much matter, but no outsider would have found those keys in a  month of Sundays.
    "I, of course, had them in a few seconds, and in a few more I was in  the strong-room itself.
  I forgot to say that the moon had risen and  was letting quite a lot of light into the bank.
  I had, however,  brought a bit of candle with me from my room; and in the strong-room,  which was down some narrow stairs behind the counter in the  banking-chamber, I had no hesitation in lighting it.
  There was no  window down there, and, though I could no longer hear old Ewbank  snoring, I had not the slightest reason to anticipate disturbance from  that quarter.
  I did think of locking myself in while I was at work,  but, thank goodness, the iron door had no keyhole on the inside.
    "Well, there were heaps of gold in the safe, but I only took what I  needed and could comfortably carry, not much more than a couple of  hundred altogether.
  Not a note would I touch, and my native caution  came out also in the way I divided the sovereigns between all my  pockets, and packed them up so that I shouldn't be like the old woman  of Banbury Cross.
  Well, you think me too cautious still, but I was  insanely cautious then.
  And so it was that, just as I was ready to go,  whereas I might have been gone ten minutes, there came a violent  knocking at the outer door.
    "Bunny, it was the outer door of the banking-chamber!  My candle must  have been seen!  And there I stood, with the grease running hot over my  fingers, in that brick grave of a strong-room!    "There was only one thing to be done.
  I must trust to the sound  sleeping of Ewbank upstairs, open the door myself, knock the visitor  down, or shoot him with the revolver I had been new chum enough to buy  before leaving Melbourne, and make a dash for that clump of trees and  the doctor's mare.
  My mind was made up in an instant, and I was at the  top of the strong-room stairs, the knocking still continuing, when a  second sound drove me back.
  It was the sound of bare feet coming along  a corridor.
    "My narrow stair was stone, I tumbled down it with little noise, and  had only to push open the iron door, for I had left the keys in the  safe.
  As I did so I heard a handle turn overhead, and thanked my gods  that I had shut every single door behind me.
  You see, old chap, one's  caution doesn't always let one in!    "'Who's that knocking?' said Ewbank up above.
    "I could not make out the answer, but it sounded to me like the  irrelevant supplication of a spent man.
  What I did hear, plainly, was  the cocking of the bank revolver before the bolts were shot back.
  Then, a tottering step, a hard, short, shallow breathing, and Ewbank's  voice in horror--    "'My God!  Good Lord!  What's happened to you?  You're bleeding like a  pig!'    "'Not now,' came with a grateful sort of sigh.
    "'But you have been!  What's done it?'    "'Bushrangers.
'    "'Down the road?'    "'This and Whittlesea--tied to tree--cock shots--left me--bleed to  death .
.
.
'"    The weak voice failed, and the bare feet bolted.
  Now was my time--if  the poor devil had fainted.
  But I could not be sure, and there I  crouched down below in the dark, at the half-shut iron door, not less  spellbound than imprisoned.
  It was just as well, for Ewbank wasn't  gone a minute.
    "'Drink this,' I heard him say, and, when the other spoke again, his  voice was stronger.
    "'Now I begin to feel alive .
.
.
'    "'Don't talk!'    "'It does me good.
  You don't know what it was, all those miles alone,  one an hour at the outside!  I never thought I should come through.
 You  must let me tell you--in case I don't!'    "'Well, have another sip.
'    "'Thank you .
.
.
  I said bushrangers; of course, there are no such  things nowadays.
'    "'What were they, then?'    "'Bank-thieves; the one that had the pot shots was the very brute I  drove out of the bank at Coburg, with a bullet in him!"'    "I knew it!"    "Of course you did, Bunny; so did I, down in that strong-room; but old  Ewbank didn't, and I thought he was never going to speak again.
    "'You're delirious,' he says at last.
  'Who in blazes do you think you  are?'    "'The new manager.
'    "'The new manager's in bed and asleep upstairs.
'    "'When did he arrive?'    "'This evening.
'    "'Call himself Raffles?'    "'Yes.
'    "'Well, I'm damned!' whispered the real man.
 'I thought it was just  revenge, but now I see what it was.
  My dear sir, the man upstairs is  an imposter--if he's upstairs still!  He must be one of the gang.
  He's  going to rob the bank--if he hasn't done so already!'    "'If he hasn't done so already,' muttered Ewbank after him; 'if he's  upstairs still!  By God, if he is, I'm sorry for him!'    "His tone was quiet enough, but about the nastiest I ever heard.
  I  tell you, Bunny, I was glad I'd brought that revolver.
  It looked as  though it must be mine against his, muzzle to muzzle.
    "'Better have a look down here, first,' said the new manager.
    "'While he gets through his window?  No, no, he's not down here.
'    "'It's easy to have a look.
'    "Bunny, if you ask me what was the most thrilling moment of my infamous  career, I say it was that moment.
  There I stood at the bottom of those  narrow stone stairs, inside the strong-room, with the door a good foot  open, and I didn't know whether it would creak or not.
  The light was  coming nearer--and I didn't know!  I had to chance it.
  And it didn't  creak a bit; it was far too solid and well-hung; and I couldn't have  banged it if I tried, it was too heavy; and it fitted so close that I  felt and heard the air squeeze out in my face.
  Every shred of light  went out, except the streak underneath, and it brightened.
  How I  blessed that door!    "'No, he's not down THERE,' I heard, as though through cotton-wool;  then the streak went out too, and in a few seconds I ventured to open  once more, and was in time to hear them creeping to my room.
    "Well, now there was not a fifth of a second to be lost; but I'm proud  to say I came up those stairs on my toes and fingers, and out of that  bank (they'd gone and left the door open) just as gingerly as though my  time had been my own.
  I didn't even forget to put on the hat that the  doctor's mare was eating her oats out of, as well as she could with a  bit, or it alone would have landed me.
  I didn't even gallop away, but  just jogged off quietly in the thick dust at the side of the road  (though I own my heart was galloping), and thanked my stars the bank  was at that end of the township, in which I really hadn't set foot.
  The very last thing I heard was the two managers raising Cain and the  coachman.
  And now, Bunny--"    He stood up and stretched himself, with a smile that ended in a yawn.
  The black windows had faded through every shade of indigo; they now  framed their opposite neighbors, stark and livid in the dawn; and the  gas seemed turned to nothing in the globes.
    "But that's not all?" I cried.
    "I'm sorry to say it is," said Raffles apologetically.
  "The thing  should have ended with an exciting chase, I know, but somehow it  didn't.
  I suppose they thought I had got no end of a start; then they  had made up their minds that I belonged to the gang, which was not so  many miles away; and one of them had got as much as he could carry from  that gang as it was.
  But I wasn't to know all that, and I'm bound to  say that there was plenty of excitement left for me.
  Lord, how I made  that poor brute travel when I got among the trees! Though we must have  made it over fifty miles from Melbourne, we had done it at a snail's  pace; and those stolen oats had brisked the old girl up to such a pitch  that she fairly bolted when she felt her nose turned south.
  By Jove,  it was no joke, in and out among those trees, and under branches with  your face in the mane!  I told you about the forest of dead gums?  It  looked perfectly ghostly in the moonlight.
  And I found it as still as  I had left it--so still that I pulled up there, my first halt, and lay  with my ear to the ground for two or three minutes.
  But I heard  nothing--not a thing but the mare's bellow and my own heart.
  I'm  sorry, Bunny; but if ever you write my memoirs, you won't have any  difficulty in working up that chase.
 Play those dead gum-trees for all  they're worth, and let the bullets fly like hail.
  I'll turn round in  my saddle to see Ewbank coming up hell-to-leather in his white suit,  and I'll duly paint it red.
  Do it in the third person, and they won't  know how it's going to end.
"    "But I don't know myself," I complained.
 "Did the mare carry you all  the way back to Melbourne?"    "Every rod, pole or perch!  I had her well seen to at our hotel, and  returned her to the doctor in the evening.
  He was tremendously tickled  to hear that I had been bushed; next morning he brought me the paper to  show me what I had escaped at Yea!"    "Without suspecting anything?"    "Ah!" said Raffles, as he put out the gas; "that's a point on which  I've never made up my mind.
 The mare and her color was a  coincidence--luckily she was only a bay--and I fancied the condition of  the beast must have told a tale.
  The doctor's manner was certainly  different.
  I'm inclined to think he suspected something, though not  the right thing.
  I wasn't expecting him, and I fear my appearance may  have increased his suspicions.
"    I asked him why.
    "I used to have rather a heavy moustache," said Raffles, "but I lost it  the day after I lost my innocence.
"        WILFUL MURDER    Of the various robberies in which we were both concerned, it is but the  few, I find, that will bear telling at any length.
  Not that the others  contained details which even I would hesitate to recount; it is,  rather, the very absence of untoward incident which renders them  useless for my present purpose.
  In point of fact our plans were so  craftily laid (by Raffles) that the chances of a hitch were invariably  reduced to a minimum before we went to work.
  We might be disappointed  in the market value of our haul; but it was quite the exception for us  to find ourselves confronted by unforeseen impediments, or involved in  a really dramatic dilemma.
  There was a sameness even in our spoil;  for, of course, only the most precious stones are worth the trouble we  took and the risks we ran.
  In short, our most successful escapades  would prove the greatest weariness of all in narrative form; and none  more so than the dull affair of the Ardagh emeralds, some eight or nine  weeks after the Milchester cricket week.
  The former, however, had a  sequel that I would rather forget than all our burglaries put together.
    It was the evening after our return from Ireland, and I was waiting at  my rooms for Raffles, who had gone off as usual to dispose of the  plunder.
  Raffles had his own method of conducting this very vital  branch of our business, which I was well content to leave entirely in  his hands.
  He drove the bargains, I believe, in a thin but subtle  disguise of the flashy-seedy order, and always in the Cockney dialect,  of which he had made himself a master.
  Moreover, he invariably  employed the same "fence," who was ostensibly a money-lender in a small  (but yet notorious) way, and in reality a rascal as remarkable as  Raffles himself.
 Only lately I also had been to the man, but in my  proper person.
  We had needed capital for the getting of these very  emeralds, and I had raised a hundred pounds, on the terms you would  expect, from a soft-spoken graybeard with an ingratiating smile, an  incessant bow, and the shiftiest old eyes that ever flew from rim to  rim of a pair of spectacles.
  So the original sinews and the final  spoils of war came in this case from the self-same source--a  circumstance which appealed to us both.
    But these same final spoils I was still to see, and I waited and waited  with an impatience that grew upon me with the growing dusk.
  At my open  window I had played Sister Ann until the faces in the street below were  no longer distinguishable.
 And now I was tearing to and fro in the grip  of horrible hypotheses--a grip that tightened when at last the  lift-gates opened with a clatter outside--that held me breathless until  a well-known tattoo followed on my door.
    "In the dark!" said Raffles, as I dragged him in.
  "Why, Bunny, what's  wrong?"    "Nothing--now you've come," said I, shutting the door behind him in a  fever of relief and anxiety.
  "Well?  Well?  What did they fetch?"    "Five hundred.
"    "Down?"    "Got it in my pocket.
"    "Good man!" I cried.
  "You don't know what a stew I've been in.
  I'll  switch on the light.
  I've been thinking of you and nothing else for  the last hour.
  I--I was ass enough to think something had gone wrong!"    Raffles was smiling when the white light filled the room, but for the  moment I did not perceive the peculiarity of his smile.
  I was  fatuously full of my own late tremors and present relief; and my first  idiotic act was to spill some whiskey and squirt the soda-water all  over in my anxiety to do instant justice to the occasion.
    "So you thought something had happened?" said Raffles, leaning back in  my chair as he lit a cigarette, and looking much amused.
  "What would  you say if something had?  Sit tight, my dear chap!  It was nothing of  the slightest consequence, and it's all over now.
  A stern chase and a  long one, Bunny, but I think I'm well to windward this time.
"    And suddenly I saw that his collar was limp, his hair matted, his boots  thick with dust.
    "The police?" I whispered aghast.
    "Oh, dear, no; only old Baird.
"    "Baird!  But wasn't it Baird who took the emeralds?"    "It was.
"    "Then how came he to chase you?"    "My dear fellow, I'll tell you if you give me a chance; it's really  nothing to get in the least excited about.
  Old Baird has at last  spotted that I'm not quite the common cracksman I would have him think  me.
  So he's been doing his best to run me to my burrow.
"    "And you call that nothing!"    "It would be something if he had succeeded; but he has still to do  that.
  I admit, however, that he made me sit up for the time being.
  It  all comes of going on the job so far from home.
  There was the old  brute with the whole thing in his morning paper.
  He KNEW it must have  been done by some fellow who could pass himself off for a gentleman,  and I saw his eyebrows go up the moment I told him I was the man, with  the same old twang that you could cut with a paper-knife.
  I did my  best to get out of it--swore I had a pal who was a real swell--but I  saw very plainly that I had given myself away.
  He gave up haggling.
  He paid my price as though he enjoyed doing it.
  But I FELT him  following me when I made tracks; though, of course, I didn't turn round  to see.
"    "Why not?"    "My dear Bunny, it's the very worst thing you can do.
  As long as you  look unsuspecting they'll keep their distance, and so long as they keep  their distance you stand a chance.
  Once show that you know you're  being followed, and it's flight or fight for all you're worth.
  I never  even looked round; and mind you never do in the same hole.
  I just  hurried up to Blackfriars and booked for High Street, Kensington, at  the top of my voice; and as the train was leaving Sloane Square out I  hopped, and up all those stairs like a lamplighter, and round to the  studio by the back streets.
  Well, to be on the safe side, I lay low  there all the afternoon, hearing nothing in the least suspicious, and  only wishing I had a window to look through instead of that beastly  skylight.
  However, the coast seemed clear enough, and thus far it was  my mere idea that he would follow me; there was nothing to show he had.
  So at last I marched out in my proper rig--almost straight into old  Baird's arms!"    "What on earth did you do?"    "Walked past him as though I had never set eyes on him in my life, and  didn't then; took a hansom in the King's Road, and drove like the deuce  to Clapham Junction; rushed on to the nearest platform, without a  ticket, jumped into the first train I saw, got out at Twickenham,  walked full tilt back to Richmond, took the District to Charing Cross,  and here I am!  Ready for a tub and a change, and the best dinner the  club can give us.
 I came to you first, because I thought you might be  getting anxious.
  Come round with me, and I won't keep you long.
"    "You're certain you've given him the slip?" I said, as we put on our  hats.
    "Certain enough; but we can make assurance doubly sure," said Raffles,  and went to my window, where he stood for a moment or two looking down  into the street.
    "All right?" I asked him.
    "All right," said he; and we went downstairs forthwith, and so to the  Albany arm-in-arm.
    But we were both rather silent on our way.
  I, for my part, was  wondering what Raffles would do about the studio in Chelsea, whither,  at all events, he had been successfully dogged.
  To me the point seemed  one of immediate importance, but when I mentioned it he said there was  time enough to think about that.
  His one other remark was made after  we had nodded (in Bond Street) to a young blood of our acquaintance who  happened to be getting himself a bad name.
    "Poor Jack Rutter!" said Raffles, with a sigh.
 "Nothing's sadder than  to see a fellow going to the bad like that.
  He's about mad with drink  and debt, poor devil!  Did you see his eye?  Odd that we should have  met him to-night, by the way; it's old Baird who's said to have skinned  him.
  By God, but I'd like to skin old Baird!"    And his tone took a sudden low fury, made the more noticeable by  another long silence, which lasted, indeed, throughout an admirable  dinner at the club, and for some time after we had settled down in a  quiet corner of the smoking-room with our coffee and cigars.
  Then at  last I saw Raffles looking at me with his lazy smile, and I knew that  the morose fit was at an end.
    "I daresay you wonder what I've been thinking about all this time?"  said he.
  "I've been thinking what rot it is to go doing things by  halves!"    "Well," said I, returning his smile, "that's not a charge that you can  bring against yourself, is it?"    "I'm not so sure," said Raffles, blowing a meditative puff; "as a  matter of fact, I was thinking less of myself than of that poor devil  of a Jack Rutter.
  There's a fellow who does things by halves; he's  only half gone to the bad; and look at the difference between him and  us!  He's under the thumb of a villainous money-lender; we are solvent  citizens.
  He's taken to drink; we're as sober as we are solvent.
  His  pals are beginning to cut him; our difficulty is to keep the pal from  the door.
  Enfin, he begs or borrows, which is stealing by halves; and  we steal outright and are done with it.
  Obviously ours is the more  honest course.
  Yet I'm not sure, Bunny, but we're doing the thing by  halves ourselves!"    "Why?  What more could we do?" I exclaimed in soft derision, looking  round, however, to make sure that we were not overheard.
    "What more," said Raffles.
  "Well, murder--for one thing.
"    "Rot!"    "A matter of opinion, my dear Bunny; I don't mean it for rot.
  I've  told you before that the biggest man alive is the man who's committed a  murder, and not yet been found out; at least he ought to be, but he so  very seldom has the soul to appreciate himself.
  Just think of it!  Think of coming in here and talking to the men, very likely about the  murder itself; and knowing you've done it; and wondering how they'd  look if THEY knew! Oh, it would be great, simply great!  But, besides  all that, when you were caught there'd be a merciful and dramatic end  of you.
  You'd fill the bill for a few weeks, and then snuff out with a  flourish of extra-specials; you wouldn't rust with a vile repose for  seven or fourteen years.
"    "Good old Raffles!" I chuckled.
  "I begin to forgive you for being in  bad form at dinner.
"    "But I was never more earnest in my life.
"    "Go on!"    "I mean it.
"    "You know very well that you wouldn't commit a murder, whatever else  you might do.
"    "I know very well I'm going to commit one to-night!"    He had been leaning back in the saddle-bag chair, watching me with keen  eyes sheathed by languid lids; now he started forward, and his eyes  leapt to mine like cold steel from the scabbard.
  They struck home to  my slow wits; their meaning was no longer in doubt.
  I, who knew the  man, read murder in his clenched hands, and murder in his locked lips,  but a hundred murders in those hard blue eyes.
    "Baird?" I faltered, moistening my lips with my tongue.
    "Of course.
"    "But you said it didn't matter about the room in Chelsea?"    "I told a lie.
"    "Anyway you gave him the slip afterwards!"    "That was another.
  I didn't.
  I thought I had when I came up to you  this evening; but when I looked out of your window--you remember?  to  make assurance doubly sure--there he was on the opposite pavement down  below.
"    "And you never said a word about it!"    "I wasn't going to spoil your dinner, Bunny, and I wasn't going to let  you spoil mine.
  But there he was as large as life, and, of course, he  followed us to the Albany.
  A fine game for him to play, a game after  his mean old heart: blackmail from me, bribes from the police, the one  bidding against the other; but he sha'n't play it with me, he sha'n't  live to, and the world will have an extortioner the less.
  Waiter!  Two  Scotch whiskeys and sodas.
  I'm off at eleven, Bunny; it's the only  thing to be done.
"    "You know where he lives, then?"    "Yes, out Willesden way, and alone; the fellow's a miser among other  things.
  I long ago found out all about him.
"    Again I looked round the room; it was a young man's club, and young men  were laughing, chatting, smoking, drinking, on every hand.
  One nodded  to me through the smoke.
  Like a machine I nodded to him, and turned  back to Raffles with a groan.
    "Surely you will give him a chance!" I urged.
 "The very sight of your  pistol should bring him to terms.
"    "It wouldn't make him keep them.
"    "But you might try the effect?"    "I probably shall.
  Here's a drink for you, Bunny.
  Wish me luck.
"    "I'm coming too.
"    "I don't want you.
"    "But I must come!"    An ugly gleam shot from the steel blue eyes.
    "To interfere?" said Raffles.
    "Not I.
"    "You give me your word?"    "I do.
"    "Bunny, if you break it--"    "You may shoot me, too!"    "I most certainly should," said Raffles, solemnly.
 "So you come at your  own peril, my dear man; but, if you are coming--well, the sooner the  better, for I must stop at my rooms on the way.
"    Five minutes later I was waiting for him at the Piccadilly entrance to  the Albany.
  I had a reason for remaining outside.
  It was the  feeling--half hope, half fear--that Angus Baird might still be on our  trail--that some more immediate and less cold-blooded way of dealing  with him might result from a sudden encounter between the money-lender  and myself.
  I would not warn him of his danger; but I would avert  tragedy at all costs.
  And when no such encounter had taken place, and  Raffles and I were fairly on our way to Willesden, that, I think, was  still my honest resolve.
  I would not break my word if I could help it,  but it was a comfort to feel that I could break it if I liked, on an  understood penalty.
  Alas!  I fear my good intentions were tainted with  a devouring curiosity, and overlaid by the fascination which goes hand  in hand with horror.
    I have a poignant recollection of the hour it took us to reach the  house.
  We walked across St.
 James's Park (I can see the lights now,  bright on the bridge and blurred in the water), and we had some minutes  to wait for the last train to Willesden.
  It left at 11.
21, I remember,  and Raffles was put out to find it did not go on to Kensal Rise.
 We had  to get out at Willesden Junction and walk on through the streets into  fairly open country that happened to be quite new to me.
  I could never  find the house again.
  I remember, however, that we were on a dark  footpath between woods and fields when the clocks began striking twelve.
    "Surely," said I, "we shall find him in bed and asleep?"    "I hope we do," said Raffles grimly.
    "Then you mean to break in?"    "What else did you think?"    I had not thought about it at all; the ultimate crime had monopolized  my mind.
  Beside it burglary was a bagatelle, but one to deprecate none  the less.
  I saw obvious objections: the man was au fait with cracksmen  and their ways: he would certainly have firearms, and might be the  first to use them.
    "I could wish nothing better," said Raffles.
 "Then it will be man to  man, and devil take the worst shot.
  You don't suppose I prefer foul  play to fair, do you?  But die he must, by one or the other, or it's a  long stretch for you and me.
"    "Better that than this!"    "Then stay where you are, my good fellow.
  I told you I didn't want  you; and this is the house.
 So good-night.
"    I could see no house at all, only the angle of a high wall rising  solitary in the night, with the starlight glittering on battlements of  broken glass; and in the wall a tall green gate, bristling with spikes,  and showing a front for battering-rams in the feeble rays an outlying  lamp-post cast across the new-made road.
  It seemed to me a road of  building-sites, with but this one house built, all by itself, at one  end; but the night was too dark for more than a mere impression.
    Raffles, however, had seen the place by daylight, and had come prepared  for the special obstacles; already he was reaching up and putting  champagne corks on the spikes, and in another moment he had his folded  covert-coat across the corks.
  I stepped back as he raised himself, and  saw a little pyramid of slates snip the sky above the gate; as he  squirmed over I ran forward, and had my own weight on the spikes and  corks and covert-coat when he gave the latter a tug.
    "Coming after all?"    "Rather!"    "Take care, then; the place is all bell-wires and springs.
  It's no  soft thing, this!  There--stand still while I take off the corks.
"    The garden was very small and new, with a grass-plot still in separate  sods, but a quantity of full-grown laurels stuck into the raw clay  beds.
 "Bells in themselves," as Raffles whispered; "there's nothing  else rustles so--cunning old beast!"  And we gave them a wide berth as  we crept across the grass.
    "He's gone to bed!"    "I don't think so, Bunny.
  I believe he's seen us.
"    "Why?"    "I saw a light.
"    "Where?"    "Downstairs, for an instant, when I--"    His whisper died away; he had seen the light again; and so had I.
    It lay like a golden rod under the front-door--and vanished.
  It  reappeared like a gold thread under the lintel--and vanished for good.
  We heard the stairs creak, creak, and cease, also for good.
  We neither  saw nor heard any more, though we stood waiting on the grass till our  feet were soaked with the dew.
    "I'm going in," said Raffles at last.
  "I don't believe he saw us at  all.
  I wish he had.
  This way.
"    We trod gingerly on the path, but the gravel stuck to our wet soles,  and grated horribly in a little tiled veranda with a glass door leading  within.
 It was through this glass that Raffles had first seen the  light; and he now proceeded to take out a pane, with the diamond, the  pot of treacle, and the sheet of brown paper which were seldom omitted  from his impedimenta.
  Nor did he dispense with my own assistance,  though he may have accepted it as instinctively as it was proffered.
  In any case it was these fingers that helped to spread the treacle on  the brown paper, and pressed the latter to the glass until the diamond  had completed its circuit and the pane fell gently back into our hands.
    Raffles now inserted his hand, turned the key in the lock, and, by  making a long arm, succeeded in drawing the bolt at the bottom of the  door; it proved to be the only one, and the door opened, though not  very wide.
    "What's that?" said Raffles, as something crunched beneath his feet on  the very threshold.
    "A pair of spectacles," I whispered, picking them up.
  I was still  fingering the broken lenses and the bent rims when Raffles tripped and  almost fell, with a gasping cry that he made no effort to restrain.
    "Hush, man, hush!" I entreated under my breath.
  "He'll hear you!"    For answer his teeth chattered--even his--and I heard him fumbling with  his matches.
  "No, Bunny; he won't hear us," whispered Raffles,  presently; and he rose from his knees and lit a gas as the match burnt  down.
    Angus Baird was lying on his own floor, dead, with his gray hairs glued  together by his blood; near him a poker with the black end glistening;  in a corner his desk, ransacked, littered.
 A clock ticked noisily on  the chimney-piece; for perhaps a hundred seconds there was no other  sound.
    Raffles stood very still, staring down at the dead, as a man might  stare into an abyss after striding blindly to its brink.
  His breath  came audibly through wide nostrils; he made no other sign, and his lips  seemed sealed.
    "That light!" said I, hoarsely; "the light we saw under the door!"    With a start he turned to me.
    "It's true!  I had forgotten it.
  It was in here I saw it first!"    "He must be upstairs still!"    "If he is we'll soon rout him out.
  Come on!"    Instead I laid a hand upon his arm, imploring him to reflect--that his  enemy was dead now--that we should certainly be involved--that now or  never was our own time to escape.
  He shook me off in a sudden fury of  impatience, a reckless contempt in his eyes, and, bidding me save my  own skin if I liked, he once more turned his back upon me, and this  time left me half resolved to take him at his word.
  Had he forgotten  on what errand he himself was here?  Was he determined that this night  should end in black disaster?  As I asked myself these questions his  match flared in the hall; in another moment the stairs were creaking  under his feet, even as they had creaked under those of the murderer;  and the humane instinct that inspired him in defiance of his risk was  borne in also upon my slower sensibilities.
  Could we let the murderer  go?  My answer was to bound up the creaking stairs and to overhaul  Raffles on the landing.
    But three doors presented themselves; the first opened into a bedroom  with the bed turned down but undisturbed; the second room was empty in  every sense; the third door was locked.
    Raffles lit the landing gas.
    "He's in there," said he, cocking his revolver.
 "Do you remember how we  used to break into the studies at school?  Here goes!"    His flat foot crashed over the keyhole, the lock gave, the door flew  open, and in the sudden draught the landing gas heeled over like a  cobble in a squall; as the flame righted itself I saw a fixed bath, two  bath-towels knotted together--an open window--a cowering figure--and  Raffles struck aghast on the threshold.
    "JACK--RUTTER?"    The words came thick and slow with horror, and in horror I heard myself  repeating them, while the cowering figure by the bathroom window rose  gradually erect.
    "It's you!" he whispered, in amazement no less than our own; "it's you  two!  What's it mean, Raffles?  I saw you get over the gate; a bell  rang, the place is full of them.
  Then you broke in.
  What's it all  mean?"    "We may tell you that, when you tell us what in God's name you've done,  Rutter!"    "Done?  What have I done?"  The unhappy wretch came out into the light  with bloodshot, blinking eyes, and a bloody shirt-front.
  "You  know--you've seen--but I'll tell you if you like.
  I've killed a  robber; that's all.
  I've killed a robber, a usurer, a jackal, a  blackmailer, the cleverest and the cruellest villain unhung.
  I'm ready  to hang for him.
  I'd kill him again!"    And he looked us fiercely in the face, a fine defiance in his  dissipated eyes; his breast heaving, his jaw like a rock.
    "Shall I tell you how it happened?" he went passionately on.
  "He's  made my life a hell these weeks and months past.
  You may know that.
  A  perfect hell!  Well, to-night I met him in Bond Street.
  Do you  remember when I met you fellows?  He wasn't twenty yards behind you; he  was on your tracks, Raffles; he saw me nod to you, and stopped me and  asked me who you were.
  He seemed as keen as knives to know, I couldn't  think why, and didn't care either, for I saw my chance.
  I said I'd  tell him all about you if he'd give me a private interview.
  He said he  wouldn't.
  I said he should, and held him by the coat; by the time I  let him go you were out of sight, and I waited where I was till he came  back in despair.
  I had the whip-hand of him then.
  I could dictate  where the interview should be, and I made him take me home with him,  still swearing to tell him all about you when we'd had our talk.
  Well,  when we got here I made him give me something to eat, putting him off  and off; and about ten o'clock I heard the gate shut.
  I waited a bit,  and then asked him if he lived alone.
    "'Not at all,' says he; 'did you not see the servant?'    "I said I'd seen her, but I thought I'd heard her go; if I was mistaken  no doubt she would come when she was called; and I yelled three times  at the top of my voice.
  Of course there was no servant to come.
  I  knew that, because I came to see him one night last week, and he  interviewed me himself through the gate, but wouldn't open it.
 Well,  when I had done yelling, and not a soul had come near us, he was as  white as that ceiling.
 Then I told him we could have our chat at last;  and I picked the poker out of the fender, and told him how he'd robbed  me, but, by God, he shouldn't rob me any more.
  I gave him three  minutes to write and sign a settlement of all his iniquitous claims  against me, or have his brains beaten out over his own carpet.
  He  thought a minute, and then went to his desk for pen and paper.
  In two  seconds he was round like lightning with a revolver, and I went for him  bald-headed.
  He fired two or three times and missed; you can find the  holes if you like; but I hit him every time--my God!  I was like a  savage till the thing was done.
 And then I didn't care.
  I went through  his desk looking for my own bills, and was coming away when you turned  up.
  I said I didn't care, nor do I; but I was going to give myself up  to-night, and shall still; so you see I sha'n't give you fellows much  trouble!"    He was done; and there we stood on the landing of the lonely house, the  low, thick, eager voice still racing and ringing through our ears; the  dead man below, and in front of us his impenitent slayer.
  I knew to  whom the impenitence would appeal when he had heard the story, and I  was not mistaken.
    "That's all rot," said Raffles, speaking after a pause; "we sha'n't let  you give yourself up.
"    "You sha'n't stop me!  What would be the good?  The woman saw me; it  would only be a question of time; and I can't face waiting to be taken.
  Think of it: waiting for them to touch you on the shoulder!  No, no,  no; I'll give myself up and get it over.
"    His speech was changed; he faltered, floundered.
 It was as though a  clearer perception of his position had come with the bare idea of  escape from it.
    "But listen to me," urged Raffles; "We're here at our peril ourselves.
  We broke in like thieves to enforce redress for a grievance very like  your own.
  But don't you see?  We took out a pane--did the thing like  regular burglars.
  Regular burglars will get the credit of all the  rest!"    "You mean that I sha'n't be suspected?"    "I do.
"    "But I don't want to get off scotfree," cried Rutter hysterically.
  "I've killed him.
  I know that.
  But it was in self-defence; it wasn't  murder.
  I must own up and take the consequences.
 I shall go mad if I  don't!"    His hands twitched; his lips quivered; the tears were in his eyes.
  Raffles took him roughly by the shoulder.
    "Look here, you fool!  If the three of us were caught here now, do you  know what those consequences would be?  We should swing in a row at  Newgate in six weeks' time!  You talk as though we were sitting in a  club; don't you know it's one o'clock in the morning, and the lights  on, and a dead man down below?  For God's sake pull yourself together,  and do what I tell you, or you're a dead man yourself.
"    "I wish I was one!" Rutter sobbed.
  "I wish I had his revolver to blow  my own brains out.
 It's lying under him.
  O my God, my God!"    His knees knocked together: the frenzy of reaction was at its height.
  We had to take him downstairs between us, and so through the front door  out into the open air.
    All was still outside--all but the smothered weeping of the unstrung  wretch upon our hands.
  Raffles returned for a moment to the house;  then all was dark as well.
  The gate opened from within; we closed it  carefully behind us; and so left the starlight shining on broken glass  and polished spikes, one and all as we had found them.
    We escaped; no need to dwell on our escape.
  Our murderer seemed set  upon the scaffold--drunk with his deed, he was more trouble than six  men drunk with wine.
  Again and again we threatened to leave him to his  fate, to wash our hands of him.
  But incredible and unmerited luck was  with the three of us.
  Not a soul did we meet between that and  Willesden; and of those who saw us later, did one think of the two  young men with crooked white ties, supporting a third in a seemingly  unmistakable condition, when the evening papers apprised the town of a  terrible tragedy at Kensal Rise?    We walked to Maida Vale, and thence drove openly to my rooms.
  But I  alone went upstairs; the other two proceeded to the Albany, and I saw  no more of Raffles for forty-eight hours.
  He was not at his rooms when  I called in the morning; he had left no word.
  When he reappeared the  papers were full of the murder; and the man who had committed it was on  the wide Atlantic, a steerage passenger from Liverpool to New York.
    "There was no arguing with him," so Raffles told me; "either he must  make a clean breast of it or flee the country.
  So I rigged him up at  the studio, and we took the first train to Liverpool.
  Nothing would  induce him to sit tight and enjoy the situation as I should have  endeavored to do in his place; and it's just as well!  I went to his  diggings to destroy some papers, and what do you think I found.
  The  police in possession; there's a warrant out against him already!  The  idiots think that window wasn't genuine, and the warrant's out.
  It  won't be my fault if it's ever served!"    Nor, after all these years, can I think it will be mine.
        NINE POINTS OF THE LAW    "Well," said Raffles, "what do you make of it?"    I read the advertisement once more before replying.
  It was in the last  column of the Daily Telegraph, and it ran:    TWO THOUSAND POUNDS REWARD--The above sum may be earned by any one  qualified to undertake delicate mission and prepared to run certain  risk.
--Apply by telegram, Security, London.
      "I think," said I, "it's the most extraordinary advertisement that ever  got into print!"    Raffles smiled.
    "Not quite all that, Bunny; still, extraordinary enough, I grant you.
"    "Look at the figure!"    "It is certainly large.
"    "And the mission--and the risk!"    "Yes; the combination is frank, to say the least of it.
  But the really  original point is requiring applications by telegram to a telegraphic  address!  There's something in the fellow who thought of that, and  something in his game; with one word he chokes off the million who  answer an advertisement every day--when they can raise the stamp.
 My  answer cost me five bob; but then I prepaid another.
"    "You don't mean to say that you've applied?"    "Rather," said Raffles.
  "I want two thousand pounds as much as any  man.
"    "Put your own name?"    "Well--no, Bunny, I didn't.
  In point of fact I smell something  interesting and illegal, and you know what a cautious chap I am.
  I  signed myself Glasspool, care of Hickey, 38, Conduit Street; that's my  tailor, and after sending the wire I went round and told him what to  expect.
  He promised to send the reply along the moment it came.
  I  shouldn't be surprised if that's it!"    And he was gone before a double-knock on the outer door had done  ringing through the rooms, to return next minute with an open telegram  and a face full of news.
    "What do you think?" said he.
  "Security's that fellow Addenbrooke, the  police-court lawyer, and he wants to see me INSTANTER!"    "Do you know him, then?"    "Merely by repute.
  I only hope he doesn't know me.
  He's the chap who  got six weeks for sailing too close to the wind in the Sutton-Wilmer  case; everybody wondered why he wasn't struck off the rolls.
  Instead  of that he's got a first-rate practice on the seamy side, and every  blackguard with half a case takes it straight to Bennett Addenbrooke.
  He's probably the one man who would have the cheek to put in an  advertisement like that, and the one man who could do it without  exciting suspicion.
  It's simply in his line; but you may be sure  there's something shady at the bottom of it.
  The odd thing is that I  have long made up my mind to go to Addenbrooke myself if accidents  should happen.
"    "And you're going to him now?"    "This minute," said Raffles, brushing his hat; "and so are you.
"    "But I came in to drag you out to lunch.
"    "You shall lunch with me when we've seen this fellow.
  Come on, Bunny,  and we'll choose your name on the way.
  Mine's Glasspool, and don't you  forget it.
"    Mr. Bennett Addenbrooke occupied substantial offices in Wellington  Street, Strand, and was out when we arrived; but he had only just gone  "over the way to the court"; and five minutes sufficed to produce a  brisk, fresh-colored, resolute-looking man, with a very confident,  rather festive air, and black eyes that opened wide at the sight of  Raffles.
    "Mr.--Glasspool?" exclaimed the lawyer.
    "My name," said Raffles, with dry effrontery.
    "Not up at Lord's, however!" said the other, slyly.
  "My dear sir, I  have seen you take far too many wickets to make any mistake!"    For a single moment Raffles looked venomous; then he shrugged and  smiled, and the smile grew into a little cynical chuckle.
    "So you have bowled me out in my turn?" said he.
  "Well, I don't think  there's anything to explain.
  I am harder up than I wished to admit  under my own name, that's all, and I want that thousand pounds reward.
"    "Two thousand," said the solicitor.
  "And the man who is not above an  alias happens to be just the sort of man I want; so don't let that  worry you, my dear sir.
  The matter, however, is of a strictly private  and confidential character.
"  And he looked very hard at me.
    "Quite so," said Raffles.
  "But there was something about a risk?"    "A certain risk is involved.
"    "Then surely three heads will be better than two.
  I said I wanted that  thousand pounds; my friend here wants the other.
  We are both cursedly  hard up, and we go into this thing together or not at all.
  Must you  have his name too?  I should give him my real one, Bunny.
"    Mr. Addenbrooke raised his eyebrows over the card I found for him; then  he drummed upon it with his finger-nail, and his embarrassment  expressed itself in a puzzled smile.
    "The fact is, I find myself in a difficulty," he confessed at last.
  "Yours is the first reply I have received; people who can afford to  send long telegrams don't rush to the advertisements in the Daily  Telegraph; but, on the other hand, I was not quite prepared to hear  from men like yourselves.
  Candidly, and on consideration, I am not  sure that you ARE the stamp of men for me--men who belong to good  clubs!  I rather intended to appeal to the--er--adventurous classes.
"    "We are adventurers," said Raffles gravely.
    "But you respect the law?"    The black eyes gleamed shrewdly.
    "We are not professional rogues, if that's what you mean," said  Raffles, smiling.
  "But on our beam-ends we are; we would do a good  deal for a thousand pounds apiece, eh, Bunny?"    "Anything," I murmured.
    The solicitor rapped his desk.
    "I'll tell you what I want you to do.
  You can but refuse.
  It's  illegal, but it's illegality in a good cause; that's the risk, and my  client is prepared to pay for it.
  He will pay for the attempt, in case  of failure; the money is as good as yours once you consent to run the  risk.
  My client is Sir Bernard Debenham, of Broom Hall, Esher.
"    "I know his son," I remarked.
    Raffles knew him too, but said nothing, and his eye drooped disapproval  in my direction.
  Bennett Addenbrooke turned to me.
    "Then," said he, "you have the privilege of knowing one of the most  complete young black-guards about town, and the fons et origo of the  whole trouble.
  As you know the son, you may know the father too, at  all events by reputation; and in that case I needn't tell you that he  is a very peculiar man.
  He lives alone in a storehouse of treasures  which no eyes but his ever behold.
  He is said to have the finest  collection of pictures in the south of England, though nobody ever sees  them to judge; pictures, fiddles and furniture are his hobby, and he is  undoubtedly very eccentric.
 Nor can one deny that there has been  considerable eccentricity in his treatment of his son.
  For years Sir  Bernard paid his debts, and the other day, without the slightest  warning, not only refused to do so any more, but absolutely stopped the  lad's allowance.
  Well, I'll tell you what has happened; but first of  all you must know, or you may remember, that I appeared for young  Debenham in a little scrape he got into a year or two ago.
  I got him  off all right, and Sir Bernard paid me handsomely on the nail.
  And no  more did I hear or see of either of them until one day last week.
"    The lawyer drew his chair nearer ours, and leant forward with a hand on  either knee.
    "On Tuesday of last week I had a telegram from Sir Bernard; I was to go  to him at once.
  I found him waiting for me in the drive; without a  word he led me to the picture-gallery, which was locked and darkened,  drew up a blind, and stood simply pointing to an empty picture-frame.
  It was a long time before I could get a word out of him.
  Then at last  he told me that that frame had contained one of the rarest and most  valuable pictures in England--in the world--an original Velasquez.
  I  have checked this," said the lawyer, "and it seems literally true; the  picture was a portrait of the Infanta Maria Teresa, said to be one of  the artist's greatest works, second only to another portrait of one of  the Popes in Rome--so they told me at the National Gallery, where they  had its history by heart.
  They say there that the picture is  practically priceless.
  And young Debenham has sold it for five  thousand pounds!"    "The deuce he has," said Raffles.
    I inquired who had bought it.
    "A Queensland legislator of the name of Craggs--the Hon.
 John Montagu  Craggs, M.
L.
C.
, to give him his full title.
  Not that we knew anything  about him on Tuesday last; we didn't even know for certain that young  Debenham had stolen the picture.
  But he had gone down for money on the  Monday evening, had been refused, and it was plain enough that he had  helped himself in this way; he had threatened revenge, and this was it.
  Indeed, when I hunted him up in town on the Tuesday night, he confessed  as much in the most brazen manner imaginable.
  But he wouldn't tell me  who was the purchaser, and finding out took the rest of the week; but I  did find out, and a nice time I've had of it ever since!  Backwards and  forwards between Esher and the Metropole, where the Queenslander is  staying, sometimes twice a day; threats, offers, prayers, entreaties,  not one of them a bit of good!"    "But," said Raffles, "surely it's a clear case?  The sale was illegal;  you can pay him back his money and force him to give the picture up.
"    "Exactly; but not without an action and a public scandal, and that my  client declines to face.
  He would rather lose even his picture than  have the whole thing get into the papers; he has disowned his son, but  he will not disgrace him; yet his picture he must have by hook or  crook, and there's the rub!  I am to get it back by fair means or foul.
  He gives me carte blanche in the matter, and, I verily believe, would  throw in a blank check if asked.
  He offered one to the Queenslander,  but Craggs simply tore it in two; the one old boy is as much a  character as the other, and between the two of them I'm at my wits'  end.
"    "So you put that advertisement in the paper?" said Raffles, in the dry  tones he had adopted throughout the interview.
    "As a last resort.
  I did.
"    "And you wish us to STEAL this picture?"    It was magnificently said; the lawyer flushed from his hair to his  collar.
    "I knew you were not the men!" he groaned.
 "I never thought of men of  your stamp!  But it's not stealing," he exclaimed heatedly; "it's  recovering stolen property.
  Besides, Sir Bernard will pay him his five  thousand as soon as he has the picture; and, you'll see, old Craggs  will be just as loath to let it come out as Sir Bernard himself.
  No,  no--it's an enterprise, an adventure, if you like--but not stealing.
"    "You yourself mentioned the law," murmured Raffles.
    "And the risk," I added.
    "We pay for that," he said once more.
    "But not enough," said Raffles, shaking his head.
  "My good sir,  consider what it means to us.
  You spoke of those clubs; we should not  only get kicked out of them, but put in prison like common burglars!  It's true we're hard up, but it simply isn't worth it at the price.
  Double your stakes, and I for one am your man.
"    Addenbrooke wavered.
    "Do you think you could bring it off?"    "We could try.
"    "But you have no--"    "Experience?  Well, hardly!"    "And you would really run the risk for four thousand pounds?"    Raffles looked at me.
  I nodded.
    "We would," said he, "and blow the odds!"    "It's more than I can ask my client to pay," said Addenbrooke, growing  firm.
    "Then it's more than you can expect us to risk.
"    "You are in earnest?"    "God wot!"    "Say three thousand if you succeed!"    "Four is our figure, Mr. Addenbrooke.
"    "Then I think it should be nothing if you fail.
"    "Doubles or quits?" cried Raffles.
  "Well, that's sporting.
  Done!"    Addenbrooke opened his lips, half rose, then sat back in his chair, and  looked long and shrewdly at Raffles--never once at me.
    "I know your bowling," said he reflectively.
  "I go up to Lord's  whenever I want an hour's real rest, and I've seen you bowl again and  again--yes, and take the best wickets in England on a plumb pitch.
  I  don't forget the last Gentleman and Players; I was there.
  You're up to  every trick--every one .
.
.
  I'm inclined to think that if anybody could  bowl out this old Australian .
.
.
  Damme, I believe you're my very man!"    The bargain was clinched at the Cafe Royal, where Bennett Addenbrooke  insisted on playing host at an extravagant luncheon.
  I remember that  he took his whack of champagne with the nervous freedom of a man at  high pressure, and have no doubt I kept him in countenance by an equal  indulgence; but Raffles, ever an exemplar in such matters, was more  abstemious even than his wont, and very poor company to boot.
  I can  see him now, his eyes in his plate--thinking--thinking.
  I can see the  solicitor glancing from him to me in an apprehension of which I did my  best to disabuse him by reassuring looks.
  At the close Raffles  apologized for his preoccupation, called for an A.
B.
C.
  time-table, and  announced his intention of catching the 3.
2 to Esher.
    "You must excuse me, Mr. Addenbrooke," said he, "but I have my own  idea, and for the moment I should much prefer to keep it to myself.
  It  may end in fizzle, so I would rather not speak about it to either of  you just yet.
  But speak to Sir Bernard I must, so will you write me  one line to him on your card?  Of course, if you wish, you must come  down with me and hear what I say; but I really don't see much point in  it.
"    And as usual Raffles had his way, though Bennett Addenbrooke showed  some temper when he was gone, and I myself shared his annoyance to no  small extent.
  I could only tell him that it was in the nature of  Raffles to be self-willed and secretive, but that no man of my  acquaintance had half his audacity and determination; that I for my  part would trust him through and through, and let him gang his own gait  every time.
  More I dared not say, even to remove those chill  misgivings with which I knew that the lawyer went his way.
    That day I saw no more of Raffles, but a telegram reached me when I was  dressing for dinner:    "Be in your rooms to-morrow from noon and keep rest of day clear,  Raffles.
"     It had been sent off from Waterloo at 6.
42.
    So Raffles was back in town; at an earlier stage of our relations I  should have hunted him up then and there, but now I knew better.
  His  telegram meant that he had no desire for my society that night or the  following forenoon; that when he wanted me I should see him soon enough.
    And see him I did, towards one o'clock next day.
 I was watching for him  from my window in Mount Street, when he drove up furiously in a hansom,  and jumped out without a word to the man.
  I met him next minute at the  lift gates, and he fairly pushed me back into my rooms.
    "Five minutes, Bunny!" he cried.
  "Not a moment more.
"    And he tore off his coat before flinging himself into the nearest chair.
    "I'm fairly on the rush," he panted; "having the very devil of a time!  Not a word till I tell you all I've done.
  I settled my plan of  campaign yesterday at lunch.
  The first thing was to get in with this  man Craggs; you can't break into a place like the Metropole, it's got  to be done from the inside.
  Problem one, how to get at the fellow.
  Only one sort of pretext would do--it must be something to do with this  blessed picture, so that I might see where he'd got it and all that.
  Well, I couldn't go and ask to see it out of curiosity, and I couldn't  go as a second representative of the other old chap, and it was  thinking how I could go that made me such a bear at lunch.
  But I saw  my way before we got up.
  If I could only lay hold of a copy of the  picture I might ask leave to go and compare it with the original.
  So  down I went to Esher to find out if there was a copy in existence, and  was at Broom Hall for one hour and a half yesterday afternoon.
  There  was no copy there, but they must exist, for Sir Bernard himself  (there's 'copy' THERE!) has allowed a couple to be made since the  picture has been in his possession.
 He hunted up the painters'  addresses, and the rest of the evening I spent in hunting up the  painters themselves; but their work had been done on commission; one  copy had gone out of the country, and I'm still on the track of the  other.
"    "Then you haven't seen Craggs yet?"    "Seen him and made friends with him, and if possible he's the funnier  old cuss of the two; but you should study 'em both.
  I took the bull by  the horns this morning, went in and lied like Ananias, and it was just  as well I did--the old ruffian sails for Australia by to-morrow's boat.
  I told him a man wanted to sell me a copy of the celebrated Infanta  Maria Teresa of Velasquez, that I'd been down to the supposed owner of  the picture, only to find that he had just sold it to him.
  You should  have seen his face when I told him that!  He grinned all round his  wicked old head.
  'Did OLD Debenham admit the sale?' says he; and when  I said he had he chuckled to himself for about five minutes.
  He was so  pleased that he did just what I hoped he would do; he showed me the  great picture--luckily it isn't by any means a large one--also the case  he's got it in.
  It's an iron map-case in which he brought over the  plans of his land in Brisbane; he wants to know who would suspect it of  containing an Old Master, too?  But he's had it fitted with a new  Chubb's lock, and I managed to take an interest in the key while he was  gloating over the canvas.
  I had the wax in the palm of my hand, and I  shall make my duplicate this afternoon.
"    Raffles looked at his watch and jumped up saying he had given me a  minute too much.
    "By the way," he added, "you've got to dine with him at the Metropole  to-night!"    "I?"    "Yes; don't look so scared.
  Both of us are invited--I swore you were  dining with me.
  I accepted for us both; but I sha'n't be there.
"    His clear eye was upon me, bright with meaning and with mischief.
    I implored him to tell me what his meaning was.
    "You will dine in his private sitting-room," said Raffles; "it adjoins  his bedroom.
  You must keep him sitting as long as possible, Bunny, and  talking all the time!"    In a flash I saw his plan.
    "You're going for the picture while we're at dinner?"    "I am.
"    "If he hears you?"    "He sha'n't.
"    "But if he does!"    And I fairly trembled at the thought.
    "If he does," said Raffles, "there will be a collision, that's all.
  Revolver would be out of place in the Metropole, but I shall certainly  take a life-preserver.
"    "But it's ghastly!" I cried.
  "To sit and talk to an utter stranger and  to know that you're at work in the next room!"    "Two thousand apiece," said Raffles, quietly.
    "Upon my soul I believe I shall give it away!"    "Not you, Bunny.
  I know you better than you know yourself.
"    He put on his coat and his hat.
    "What time have I to be there?" I asked him, with a groan.
    "Quarter to eight.
  There will be a telegram from me saying I can't  turn up.
  He's a terror to talk, you'll have no difficulty in keeping  the ball rolling; but head him off his picture for all you're worth.
  If he offers to show it to you, say you must go.
  He locked up the case  elaborately this afternoon, and there's no earthly reason why he should  unlock it again in this hemisphere.
"    "Where shall I find you when I get away?"    "I shall be down at Esher.
  I hope to catch the 9.
55.
"    "But surely I can see you again this afternoon?" I cried in a ferment,  for his hand was on the door.
  "I'm not half coached up yet!  I know I  shall make a mess of it!"    "Not you," he said again, "but _I_ shall if I waste any more time.
  I've got a deuce of a lot of rushing about to do yet.
  You won't find  me at my rooms.
  Why not come down to Esher yourself by the last train?  That's it--down you come with the latest news!  I'll tell old Debenham  to expect you: he shall give us both a bed.
  By Jove! he won't be able  to do us too well if he's got his picture.
"    "If!" I groaned as he nodded his adieu; and he left me limp with  apprehension, sick with fear, in a perfectly pitiable condition of pure  stage-fright.
    For, after all, I had only to act my part; unless Raffles failed where  he never did fail, unless Raffles the neat and noiseless was for once  clumsy and inept, all I had to do was indeed to "smile and smile and be  a villain.
"  I practiced that smile half the afternoon.
  I rehearsed  putative parts in hypothetical conversations.
  I got up stories.
  I  dipped in a book on Queensland at the club.
  And at last it was 7.
45,  and I was making my bow to a somewhat elderly man with a small bald  head and a retreating brow.
    "So you're Mr. Raffles's friend?" said he, overhauling me rather rudely  with his light small eyes.
 "Seen anything of him?  Expected him early  to show me something, but he's never come.
"    No more, evidently, had his telegram, and my troubles were beginning  early.
  I said I had not seen Raffles since one o'clock, telling the  truth with unction while I could; even as we spoke there came a knock  at the door; it was the telegram at last, and, after reading it  himself, the Queenslander handed it to me.
    "Called out of town!" he grumbled.
  "Sudden illness of near relative!  What near relatives has he got?"    I knew of none, and for an instant I quailed before the perils of  invention; then I replied that I had never met any of his people, and  again felt fortified by my veracity.
    "Thought you were bosom pals?" said he, with (as I imagined) a gleam of  suspicion in his crafty little eyes.
    "Only in town," said I.
  "I've never been to his place.
"    "Well," he growled, "I suppose it can't be helped.
  Don't know why he  couldn't come and have his dinner first.
  Like to see the death-bed I'D  go to without MY dinner; it's a full-skin billet, if you ask me.
  Well,  must just dine without him, and he'll have to buy his pig in a poke  after all.
  Mind touching that bell?  Suppose you know what he came to  see me about?  Sorry I sha'n't see him again, for his own sake.
  I  liked Raffles--took to him amazingly.
  He's a cynic.
  Like cynics.
  One  myself.
  Rank bad form of his mother or his aunt, and I hope she will  go and kick the bucket.
"    I connect these specimens of his conversation, though they were  doubtless detached at the time, and interspersed with remarks of mine  here and there.
  They filled the interval until dinner was served, and  they gave me an impression of the man which his every subsequent  utterance confirmed.
  It was an impression which did away with all  remorse for my treacherous presence at his table.
  He was that terrible  type, the Silly Cynic, his aim a caustic commentary on all things and  all men, his achievement mere vulgar irreverence and unintelligent  scorn.
  Ill-bred and ill-informed, he had (on his own showing) fluked  into fortune on a rise in land; yet cunning he possessed, as well as  malice, and he chuckled till he choked over the misfortunes of less  astute speculators in the same boom.
  Even now I cannot feel much  compunction for my behavior by the Hon.
 J.
 M.
 Craggs, M.
L.
C.
    But never shall I forget the private agonies of the situation, the  listening to my host with one ear and for Raffles with the other!  Once  I heard him--though the rooms were not divided by the old-fashioned  folding-doors, and though the door that did divide them was not only  shut but richly curtained, I could have sworn I heard him once.
  I  spilt my wine and laughed at the top of my voice at some coarse sally  of my host's.
  And I heard nothing more, though my ears were on the  strain.
 But later, to my horror, when the waiter had finally withdrawn,  Craggs himself sprang up and rushed to his bedroom without a word.
  I  sat like stone till he returned.
    "Thought I heard a door go," he said.
  "Must have been mistaken .
.
.
  imagination .
.
.
 gave me quite a turn.
  Raffles tell you priceless  treasure I got in there?"    It was the picture at last; up to this point I had kept him to  Queensland and the making of his pile.
 I tried to get him back there  now, but in vain.
  He was reminded of his great ill-gotten possession.
  I said that Raffles had just mentioned it, and that set him off.
  With  the confidential garrulity of a man who has dined too well, he plunged  into his darling topic, and I looked past him at the clock.
  It was  only a quarter to ten.
    In common decency I could not go yet.
  So there I sat (we were still at  port) and learnt what had originally fired my host's ambition to  possess what he was pleased to call a "real, genuine, twin-screw,  double-funnelled, copper-bottomed Old Master"; it was to "go one  better" than some rival legislator of pictorial proclivities.
  But even  an epitome of his monologue would be so much weariness; suffice it that  it ended inevitably in the invitation I had dreaded all the evening.
    "But you must see it.
  Next room.
  This way.
"    "Isn't it packed up?" I inquired hastily.
    "Lock and key.
  That's all.
"    "Pray don't trouble," I urged.
    "Trouble be hanged!" said he.
  "Come along.
"    And all at once I saw that to resist him further would be to heap  suspicion upon myself against the moment of impending discovery.
  I  therefore followed him into his bedroom without further protest, and  suffered him first to show me the iron map-case which stood in one  corner; he took a crafty pride in this receptacle, and I thought he  would never cease descanting on its innocent appearance and its Chubb's  lock.
  It seemed an interminable age before the key was in the latter.
  Then the ward clicked, and my pulse stood still.
    "By Jove!" I cried next instant.
    The canvas was in its place among the maps!    "Thought it would knock you," said Craggs, drawing it out and unrolling  it for my benefit.
 "Grand thing, ain't it?  Wouldn't think it had been  painted two hundred and thirty years?  It has, though, MY word!  Old  Johnson's face will be a treat when he sees it; won't go bragging about  HIS pictures much more.
  Why, this one's worth all the pictures in  Colony o' Queensland put together.
  Worth fifty thousand pounds, my  boy--and I got it for five!"    He dug me in the ribs, and seemed in the mood for further confidences.
  My appearance checked him, and he rubbed his hands.
    "If you take it like that," he chuckled, "how will old Johnson take it?  Go out and hang himself to his own picture-rods, I hope!"    Heaven knows what I contrived to say at last.
 Struck speechless first  by my relief, I continued silent from a very different cause.
  A new  tangle of emotions tied my tongue.
  Raffles had failed--Raffles had  failed!  Could I not succeed?  Was it too late?  Was there no way?    "So long," he said, taking a last look at the canvas before he rolled  it up--"so long till we get to Brisbane.
"    The flutter I was in as he closed the case!    "For the last time," he went on, as his keys jingled back into his  pocket.
  "It goes straight into the strong-room on board.
"    For the last time!  If I could but send him out to Australia with only  its legitimate contents in his precious map-case!  If I could but  succeed where Raffles had failed!    We returned to the other room.
  I have no notion how long he talked, or  what about.
  Whiskey and soda-water became the order of the hour.
  I  scarcely touched it, but he drank copiously, and before eleven I left  him incoherent.
 And the last train for Esher was the 11.
50 out of  Waterloo.
    I took a hansom to my rooms.
  I was back at the hotel in thirteen  minutes.
  I walked upstairs.
 The corridor was empty; I stood an instant  on the sitting-room threshold, heard a snore within, and admitted  myself softly with my gentleman's own key, which it had been a very  simple matter to take away with me.
    Craggs never moved; he was stretched on the sofa fast asleep.
  But not  fast enough for me.
  I saturated my handkerchief with the chloroform I  had brought, and laid it gently over his mouth.
 Two or three stertorous  breaths, and the man was a log.
    I removed the handkerchief; I extracted the keys from his pocket.
    In less than five minutes I put them back, after winding the picture  about my body beneath my Inverness cape.
  I took some whiskey and  soda-water before I went.
    The train was easily caught--so easily that I trembled for ten minutes  in my first-class smoking carriage--in terror of every footstep on the  platform, in unreasonable terror till the end.
  Then at last I sat back  and lit a cigarette, and the lights of Waterloo reeled out behind.
    Some men were returning from the theatre.
  I can recall their  conversation even now.
  They were disappointed with the piece they had  seen.
 It was one of the later Savoy operas, and they spoke wistfully of  the days of "Pinafore" and "Patience.
"  One of them hummed a stave, and  there was an argument as to whether the air was out of "Patience" or  the "Mikado.
"  They all got out at Surbiton, and I was alone with my  triumph for a few intoxicating minutes.
  To think that I had succeeded  where Raffles had failed!    Of all our adventures this was the first in which I had played a  commanding part; and, of them all, this was infinitely the least  discreditable.
  It left me without a conscientious qualm; I had but  robbed a robber, when all was said.
  And I had done it myself,  single-handed--ipse egomet!    I pictured Raffles, his surprise, his delight.
  He would think a little  more of me in future.
  And that future, it should be different.
  We had  two thousand pounds apiece--surely enough to start afresh as honest  men--and all through me!    In a glow I sprang out at Esher, and took the one belated cab that was  waiting under the bridge.
 In a perfect fever I beheld Broom Hall, with  the lower story still lit up, and saw the front door open as I climbed  the steps.
    "Thought it was you," said Raffles cheerily.
 "It's all right.
  There's  a bed for you.
  Sir Bernard's sitting up to shake your hand.
"    His good spirits disappointed me.
  But I knew the man: he was one of  those who wear their brightest smile in the blackest hour.
  I knew him  too well by this time to be deceived.
    "I've got it!" I cried in his ear.
  "I've got it!"    "Got what?" he asked me, stepping back.
    "The picture!"    "WHAT?"    "The picture.
  He showed it me.
  You had to go without it; I saw that.
  So I determined to have it.
  And here it is.
"    "Let's see," said Raffles grimly.
    I threw off my cape and unwound the canvas from about my body.
  While I  was doing so an untidy old gentleman made his appearance in the hall,  and stood looking on with raised eyebrows.
    "Looks pretty fresh for an Old Master, doesn't she?" said Raffles.
    His tone was strange.
  I could only suppose that he was jealous of my  success.
    "So Craggs said.
  I hardly looked at it myself.
"    "Well, look now--look closely.
  By Jove, I must have faked her better  than I thought!"    "It's a copy!" I cried.
    "It's THE copy," he answered.
  "It's the copy I've been tearing all  over the country to procure.
  It's the copy I faked back and front, so  that, on your own showing, it imposed upon Craggs, and might have made  him happy for life.
  And you go and rob him of that!"    I could not speak.
    "How did you manage it?" inquired Sir Bernard Debenham.
    "Have you killed him?" asked Raffles sardonically.
    I did not look at him; I turned to Sir Bernard Debenham, and to him I  told my story, hoarsely, excitedly, for it was all that I could do to  keep from breaking down.
  But as I spoke I became calmer, and I  finished in mere bitterness, with the remark that another time Raffles  might tell me what he meant to do.
    "Another time!" he cried instantly.
  "My dear Bunny, you speak as  though we were going to turn burglars for a living!"    "I trust you won't," said Sir Bernard, smiling, "for you are certainly  two very daring young men.
 Let us hope our friend from Queensland will  do as he said, and not open his map-case till he gets back there.
  He  will find my check awaiting him, and I shall be very much surprised if  he troubles any of us again.
"    Raffles and I did not speak till I was in the room which had been  prepared for me.
  Nor was I anxious to do so then.
  But he followed me  and took my hand.
    "Bunny," said he, "don't you be hard on a fellow!  I was in the deuce  of a hurry, and didn't know that I should ever get what I wanted in  time, and that's a fact.
  But it serves me right that you should have  gone and undone one of the best things I ever did.
  As for YOUR  handiwork, old chap, you won't mind my saying that I didn't think you  had it in you.
  In future--"    "Don't talk to me about the future!" I cried.
 "I hate the whole thing!  I'm going to chuck it up!"    "So am I," said Raffles, "when I've made my pile.
"        THE RETURN MATCH    I had turned into Piccadilly, one thick evening in the following  November, when my guilty heart stood still at the sudden grip of a hand  upon my arm.
  I thought--I was always thinking--that my inevitable hour  was come at last.
  It was only Raffles, however, who stood smiling at  me through the fog.
    "Well met!" said he.
  "I've been looking for you at the club.
"    "I was just on my way there," I returned, with an attempt to hide my  tremors.
  It was an ineffectual attempt, as I saw from his broader  smile, and by the indulgent shake of his head.
    "Come up to my place instead," said he.
  "I've something amusing to  tell you.
"    I made excuses, for his tone foretold the kind of amusement, and it was  a kind against which I had successfully set my face for months.
  I have  stated before, however, and I can but reiterate, that to me, at all  events, there was never anybody in the world so irresistible as Raffles  when his mind was made up.
  That we had both been independent of crime  since our little service to Sir Bernard Debenham--that there had been  no occasion for that masterful mind to be made up in any such direction  for many a day--was the undeniable basis of a longer spell of honesty  than I had hitherto enjoyed during the term of our mutual intimacy.
  Be  sure I would deny it if I could; the very thing I am to tell you would  discredit such a boast.
  I made my excuses, as I have said.
    But his arm slid through mine, with his little laugh of light-hearted  mastery.
  And even while I argued we were on his staircase in the  Albany.
    His fire had fallen low.
  He poked and replenished it after lighting  the gas.
  As for me, I stood by sullenly in my overcoat until he  dragged it off my back.
    "What a chap you are!" said Raffles, playfully.
 "One would really think  I had proposed to crack another crib this blessed night!  Well, it  isn't that, Bunny; so get into that chair, and take one of these  Sullivans and sit tight.
"    He held the match to my cigarette; he brought me a whiskey and soda.
  Then he went out into the lobby, and, just as I was beginning to feel  happy, I heard a bolt shot home.
  It cost me an effort to remain in  that chair; next moment he was straddling another and gloating over my  discomfiture across his folded arms.
    "You remember Milchester, Bunny, old boy?"    His tone was as bland as mine was grim when I answered that I did.
    "We had a little match there that wasn't down on the card.
  Gentlemen  and Players, if you recollect?"    "I don't forget it.
"    "Seeing that you never got an innings, so to speak, I thought you  might.
  Well, the Gentlemen scored pretty freely, but the Players were  all caught.
"    "Poor devils!"    "Don't be too sure.
  You remember the fellow we saw in the inn?  The  florid, over-dressed chap who I told you was one of the cleverest  thieves in town?"    "I remember him.
  Crawshay his name turned out to be.
"    "Well, it was certainly the name he was convicted under, so Crawshay  let it be.
  You needn't waste any pity on HIM, old chap; he escaped  from Dartmoor yesterday afternoon.
"    "Well done!"    Raffles smiled, but his eyebrows had gone up, and his shoulders  followed suit.
    "You are perfectly right; it was very well done indeed.
  I wonder you  didn't see it in the paper.
 In a dense fog on the moor yesterday good  old Crawshay made a bolt for it, and got away without a scratch under  heavy fire.
  All honor to him, I agree; a fellow with that much grit  deserves his liberty.
  But Crawshay has a good deal more.
 They hunted  him all night long; couldn't find him for nuts; and that was all you  missed in the morning papers.
"    He unfolded a Pall Mall, which he had brought in with him.
    "But listen to this; here's an account of the escape, with just the  addition which puts the thing on a higher level.
  'The fugitive has  been traced to Totnes, where he appears to have committed a peculiarly  daring outrage in the early hours of this morning.
  He is reported to  have entered the lodgings of the Rev.
  A.
 H.
 Ellingworth, curate of the  parish, who missed his clothes on rising at the usual hour; later in  the morning those of the convict were discovered neatly folded at the  bottom of a drawer.
  Meanwhile Crawshay had made good his second  escape, though it is believed that so distinctive a guise will lead to  his recapture during the day.
'  What do you think of that, Bunny?"    "He is certainly a sportsman," said I, reaching for the paper.
    "He's more," said Raffles, "he's an artist, and I envy him.
  The  curate, of all men!  Beautiful--beautiful!  But that's not all.
  I saw  just now on the board at the club that there's been an outrage on the  line near Dawlish.
  Parson found insensible in the six-foot way.
  Our  friend again!  The telegram doesn't say so, but it's obvious; he's  simply knocked some other fellow out, changed clothes again, and come  on gayly to town.
  Isn't it great? I do believe it's the best thing of  the kind that's ever been done!"    "But why should he come to town?"    In an instant the enthusiasm faded from Raffles's face; clearly I had  reminded him of some prime anxiety, forgotten in his impersonal joy  over the exploit of a fellow-criminal.
  He looked over his shoulder  towards the lobby before replying.
    "I believe," said he, "that the beggar's on MY tracks!"    And as he spoke he was himself again--quietly amused--cynically  unperturbed--characteristically enjoying the situation and my surprise.
    "But look here, what do you mean?" said I.
 "What does Crawshay know  about you?"    "Not much; but he suspects.
"    "Why should he?"    "Because, in his way he's very nearly as good a man as I am; because,  my dear Bunny, with eyes in his head and brains behind them, he  couldn't help suspecting.
  He saw me once in town with old Baird.
  He  must have seen me that day in the pub on the way to Milchester, as well  as afterwards on the cricket-field.
  As a matter of fact, I know he  did, for he wrote and told me so before his trial.
"    "He wrote to you!  And you never told me!"    The old shrug answered the old grievance.
    "What was the good, my dear fellow?  It would only have worried you.
"    "Well, what did he say?"    "That he was sorry he had been run in before getting back to town, as  he had proposed doing himself the honor of paying me a call; however,  he trusted it was only a pleasure deferred, and he begged me not to go  and get lagged myself before he came out.
  Of course he knew the  Melrose necklace was gone, though he hadn't got it; and he said that  the man who could take that and leave the rest was a man after his own  heart.
  And so on, with certain little proposals for the far future,  which I fear may be the very near future indeed! I'm only surprised he  hasn't turned up yet.
"    He looked again towards the lobby, which he had left in darkness, with  the inner door shut as carefully as the outer one.
  I asked him what he  meant to do.
    "Let him knock--if he gets so far.
  The porter is to say I'm out of  town; it will be true, too, in another hour or so.
"    "You're going off to-night?"    "By the 7.
15 from Liverpool Street.
  I don't say much about my people,  Bunny, but I have the best of sisters married to a country parson in  the eastern counties.
  They always make me welcome, and let me read the  lessons for the sake of getting me to church.
  I'm sorry you won't be  there to hear me on Sunday, Bunny.
  I've figured out some of my best  schemes in that parish, and I know of no better port in a storm.
  But I  must pack.
  I thought I'd just let you know where I was going, and why,  in case you cared to follow my example.
"    He flung the stump of his cigarette into the fire, stretched himself as  he rose, and remained so long in the inelegant attitude that my eyes  mounted from his body to his face; a second later they had followed his  eyes across the room, and I also was on my legs.
  On the threshold of  the folding doors that divided bedroom and sitting-room, a well-built  man stood in ill-fitting broadcloth, and bowed to us until his bullet  head presented an unbroken disk of short red hair.
    Brief as was my survey of this astounding apparition, the interval was  long enough for Raffles to recover his composure; his hands were in his  pockets, and a smile upon his face, when my eyes flew back to him.
    "Let me introduce you, Bunny," said he, "to our distinguished  colleague, Mr. Reginald Crawshay.
"    The bullet head bobbed up, and there was a wrinkled brow above the  coarse, shaven face, crimson also, I remember, from the grip of a  collar several sizes too small.
  But I noted nothing consciously at the  time.
  I had jumped to my own conclusion, and I turned on Raffles with  an oath.
    "It's a trick!" I cried.
  "It's another of your cursed tricks!  You got  him here, and then you got me.
  You want me to join you, I suppose?  I'll see you damned!"    So cold was the stare which met this outburst that I became ashamed of  my words while they were yet upon my lips.
    "Really, Bunny!" said Raffles, and turned his shoulder with a shrug.
    "Lord love yer," cried Crawshay, "'_E_ knew nothin'.
  _'E_ didn't  expect me; 'E'S all right.
  And you're the cool canary, YOU are," he  went on to Raffles.
  "I knoo you were, but, do me proud, you're one  after my own kidney!"  And he thrust out a shaggy hand.
    "After that," said Raffles, taking it, "what am I to say?  But you must  have heard my opinion of you.
  I am proud to make your acquaintance.
  How the deuce did you get in?"    "Never you mind," said Crawshay, loosening his collar; "let's talk  about how I'm to get out.
 Lord love yer, but that's better!"    There was a livid ring round his bull-neck, that he fingered tenderly.
  "Didn't know how much longer I might have to play the gent," he  explained; "didn't know who you'd bring in.
"    "Drink whiskey and soda?" inquired Raffles, when the convict was in the  chair from which I had leapt.
    "No, I drink it neat," replied Crawshay, "but I talk business first.
  You don't get over me like that, Lor' love yer!"    "Well, then, what can I do for you?"    "You know without me tellin' you.
"    "Give it a name.
"    "Clean heels, then; that's what I want to show, and I leaves the way to  you.
  We're brothers in arms, though I ain't armed this time.
  It ain't  necessary.
  You've too much sense.
  But brothers we are, and you'll see  a brother through.
  Let's put it at that.
  You'll see me through in yer  own way.
  I leaves it all to you.
"    His tone was rich with conciliation and concession; he bent over and  tore a pair of button boots from his bare feet, which he stretched  towards the fire, painfully uncurling his toes.
    "I hope you take a larger size than them," said he.
  "I'd have had a  see if you'd given me time.
 I wasn't in long afore you.
"    "And you won't tell me how you got in?"    "Wot's the use?  I can't teach YOU nothin'.
  Besides, I want out.
  I  want out of London, an' England, an' bloomin' Europe too.
  That's all I  want of you, mister.
  I don't arst how YOU go on the job.
  You know  w'ere I come from, 'cos I 'eard you say; you know w'ere I want to 'ead  for, 'cos I've just told yer; the details I leaves entirely to you.
"    "Well," said Raffles, "we must see what can be done.
"    "We must," said Mr. Crawshay, and leaned back comfortably, and began  twirling his stubby thumbs.
    Raffles turned to me with a twinkle in his eye; but his forehead was  scored with thought, and resolve mingled with resignation in the lines  of his mouth.
  And he spoke exactly as though he and I were alone in  the room.
    "You seize the situation, Bunny?  If our friend here is 'copped,' to  speak his language, he means to 'blow the gaff' on you and me.
  He is  considerate enough not to say so in so many words, but it's plain  enough, and natural enough for that matter.
  I would do the same in his  place.
  We had the bulge before; he has it now; it's perfectly fair.
 We  must take on this job; we aren't in a position to refuse it; even if we  were, I should take it on!  Our friend is a great sportsman; he has got  clear away from Dartmoor; it would be a thousand pities to let him go  back.
  Nor shall he; not if I can think of a way of getting him abroad.
"    "Any way you like," murmured Crawshay, with his eyes shut.
  "I leaves  the 'ole thing to you.
"    "But you'll have to wake up and tell us things.
"    "All right, mister; but I'm fair on the rocks for a sleep!"    And he stood up, blinking.
    "Think you were traced to town?"    "Must have been.
"    "And here?"    "Not in this fog--not with any luck.
"    Raffles went into the bedroom, lit the gas there, and returned next  minute.
    "So you got in by the window?"    "That's about it.
"    "It was devilish smart of you to know which one; it beats me how you  brought it off in daylight, fog or no fog!  But let that pass.
  You  don't think you were seen?"    "I don't think it, sir.
"    "Well, let's hope you are right.
  I shall reconnoitre and soon find  out.
  And you'd better come too, Bunny, and have something to eat and  talk it over.
"    As Raffles looked at me, I looked at Crawshay, anticipating trouble;  and trouble brewed in his blank, fierce face, in the glitter of his  startled eyes, in the sudden closing of his fists.
    "And what's to become o' me?" he cried out with an oath.
    "You wait here.
"    "No, you don't," he roared, and at a bound had his back to the door.
  "You don't get round me like that, you cuckoos!"    Raffles turned to me with a twitch of the shoulders.
  "That's the worst  of these professors," said he; "they never will use their heads.
  They  see the pegs, and they mean to hit 'em; but that's all they do see and  mean, and they think we're the same.
  No wonder we licked them last  time!"    "Don't talk through yer neck," snarled the convict.
  "Talk out  straight, curse you!"    "Right," said Raffles.
  "I'll talk as straight as you like.
  You say  you put yourself in my hands--you leave it all to me--yet you don't  trust me an inch!  I know what's to happen if I fail.
  I accept the  risk.
  I take this thing on.
  Yet you think I'm going straight out to  give you away and make you give me away in my turn.
  You're a fool, Mr.  Crawshay, though you have broken Dartmoor; you've got to listen to a  better man, and obey him.
 I see you through in my own way, or not at  all.
 I come and go as I like, and with whom I like, without your  interference; you stay here and lie just as low as you know how, be as  wise as your word, and leave the whole thing to me.
  If you won't--if  you're fool enough not to trust me--there's the door.
  Go out and say  what you like, and be damned to you!"    Crawshay slapped his thigh.
    "That's talking!" said he.
  "Lord love yer, I know where I am when you  talk like that.
  I'll trust yer.
  I know a man when he gets his tongue  between his teeth; you're all right.
  I don't say so much about this  other gent, though I saw him along with you on the job that time in the  provinces; but if he's a pal of yours, Mr. Raffles, he'll be all right  too.
  I only hope you gents ain't too stony--"    And he touched his pockets with a rueful face.
    "I only went for their togs," said he.
  "You never struck two such  stony-broke cusses in yer life!"    "That's all right," said Raffles.
  "We'll see you through properly.
  Leave it to us, and you sit tight.
"    "Rightum!" said Crawshay.
  "And I'll have a sleep time you're gone.
  But no sperrits--no, thank'ee--not yet!  Once let me loose on the lush,  and, Lord love yer, I'm a gone coon!"    Raffles got his overcoat, a long, light driving-coat, I remember, and  even as he put it on our fugitive was dozing in the chair; we left him  murmuring incoherently, with the gas out, and his bare feet toasting.
    "Not such a bad chap, that professor," said Raffles on the stairs; "a  real genius in his way, too, though his methods are a little elementary  for my taste.
  But technique isn't everything; to get out of Dartmoor  and into the Albany in the same twenty-four hours is a whole that  justifies its parts.
  Good Lord!"    We had passed a man in the foggy courtyard, and Raffles had nipped my  arm.
    "Who was it?"    "The last man we want to see!  I hope to heaven he didn't hear me!"    "But who is he, Raffles?"    "Our old friend Mackenzie, from the Yard!"    I stood still with horror.
    "Do you think he's on Crawshay's track?"    "I don't know.
  I'll find out.
"    And before I could remonstrate he had wheeled me round; when I found my  voice he merely laughed, and whispered that the bold course was the  safe one every time.
    "But it's madness--"    "Not it.
  Shut up!  Is that YOU, Mr. Mackenzie?"    The detective turned about and scrutinized us keenly; and through the  gaslit mist I noticed that his hair was grizzled at the temples, and  his face still cadaverous, from the wound that had nearly been his  death.
    "Ye have the advantage o' me, sirs," said he.
    "I hope you're fit again," said my companion.
 "My name is Raffles, and  we met at Milchester last year.
"    "Is that a fact?" cried the Scotchman, with quite a start.
  "Yes, now I  remember your face, and yours too, sir.
  Ay, yon was a bad business,  but it ended vera well, an' that's the main thing.
"    His native caution had returned to him.
  Raffles pinched my arm.
    "Yes, it ended splendidly, but for you," said he.
 "But what about this  escape of the leader of the gang, that fellow Crawshay?  What do you  think of that, eh?"    "I havena the parteeculars," replied the Scot.
    "Good!" cried Raffles.
  "I was only afraid you might be on his tracks  once more!"    Mackenzie shook his head with a dry smile, and wished us good evening  as an invisible window was thrown up, and a whistle blown softly  through the fog.
    "We must see this out," whispered Raffles.
 "Nothing more natural than a  little curiosity on our part.
  After him, quick!"    And we followed the detective into another entrance on the same side as  that from which we had emerged, the left-hand side on one's way to  Piccadilly; quite openly we followed him, and at the foot of the stairs  met one of the porters of the place.
  Raffles asked him what was wrong.
    "Nothing, sir," said the fellow glibly.
    "Rot!" said Raffles.
  "That was Mackenzie, the detective.
  I've just  been speaking to him.
 What's he here for?  Come on, my good fellow; we  won't give you away, if you've instructions not to tell.
"    The man looked quaintly wistful, the temptation of an audience hot upon  him; a door shut upstairs, and he fell.
    "It's like this," he whispered.
  "This afternoon a gen'leman comes  arfter rooms, and I sent him to the orfice; one of the clurks, 'e goes  round with 'im an' shows 'im the empties, an' the gen'leman's partic'ly  struck on the set the coppers is up in now.
  So he sends the clurk to  fetch the manager, as there was one or two things he wished to speak  about; an' when they come back, blowed if the gent isn't gone!  Beg yer  pardon, sir, but he's clean disappeared off the face o' the premises!"  And the porter looked at us with shining eyes.
    "Well?" said Raffles.
    "Well, sir, they looked about, an' looked about, an' at larst they give  him up for a bad job; thought he'd changed his mind an' didn't want to  tip the clurk; so they shut up the place an' come away.
 An' that's all  till about 'alf an hour ago, when I takes the manager his extry-speshul  Star; in about ten minutes he comes running out with a note, an' sends  me with it to Scotland Yard in a hansom.
 An' that's all I know,  sir--straight.
  The coppers is up there now, and the tec, and the  manager, and they think their gent is about the place somewhere still.
  Least, I reckon that's their idea; but who he is, or what they want him  for, I dunno.
"    "Jolly interesting!" said Raffles.
  "I'm going up to inquire.
  Come on,  Bunny; there should be some fun.
"    "Beg yer pardon, Mr. Raffles, but you won't say nothing about me?"    "Not I; you're a good fellow.
  I won't forget it if this leads to  sport.
  Sport!" he whispered as we reached the landing.
  "It looks like  precious poor sport for you and me, Bunny!"    "What are you going to do?"    "I don't know.
  There's no time to think.
  This, to start with.
"    And he thundered on the shut door; a policeman opened it.
  Raffles  strode past him with the air of a chief commissioner, and I followed  before the man had recovered from his astonishment.
  The bare boards  rang under us; in the bedroom we found a knot of officers stooping over  the window-ledge with a constable's lantern.
  Mackenzie was the first  to stand upright, and he greeted us with a glare.
    "May I ask what you gentlemen want?" said he.
    "We want to lend a hand," said Raffles briskly.
 "We lent one once  before, and it was my friend here who took over from you the fellow who  split on all the rest, and held him tightly.
  Surely that entitles him,  at all events, to see any fun that's going?  As for myself, well, it's  true I only helped to carry you to the house; but for old acquaintance  I do hope, my dear Mr. Mackenzie, that you will permit us to share such  sport as there may be.
  I myself can only stop a few minutes, in any  case.
"    "Then ye'll not see much," growled the detective, "for he's not up  here.
  Constable, go you and stand at the foot o' the stairs, and let  no other body come up on any conseederation; these gentlemen may be  able to help us after all.
"    "That's kind of you, Mackenzie!" cried Raffles warmly.
  "But what is it  all?  I questioned a porter I met coming down, but could get nothing  out of him, except that somebody had been to see these rooms and not  since been seen himself.
"    "He's a man we want," said Mackenzie.
  "He's concealed himself  somewhere about these premises, or I'm vera much mistaken.
  D'ye reside  in the Albany, Mr. Raffles?"    "I do.
"    "Will your rooms be near these?"    "On the next staircase but one.
"    "Ye'll just have left them?"    "Just.
"    "Been in all the afternoon, likely?"    "Not all.
"    "Then I may have to search your rooms, sir.
  I am prepared to search  every room in the Albany!  Our man seems to have gone for the leads;  but unless he's left more marks outside than in, or we find him up  there, I shall have the entire building to ransack.
"    "I will leave you my key," said Raffles at once.
 "I am dining out, but  I'll leave it with the officer down below.
"    I caught my breath in mute amazement.
  What was the meaning of this  insane promise?  It was wilful, gratuitous, suicidal; it made me catch  at his sleeve in open horror and disgust; but, with a word of thanks,  Mackenzie had returned to his window-sill, and we sauntered unwatched  through the folding-doors into the adjoining room.
  Here the window  looked down into the courtyard; it was still open; and as we gazed out  in apparent idleness, Raffles reassured me.
    "It's all right, Bunny; you do what I tell you and leave the rest to  me.
  It's a tight corner, but I don't despair.
  What you've got to do  is to stick to these chaps, especially if they search my rooms; they  mustn't poke about more than necessary, and they won't if you're there.
"    "But where will you be?  You're never going to leave me to be landed  alone?"    "If I do, it will be to turn up trumps at the right moment.
  Besides,  there are such things as windows, and Crawshay's the man to take his  risks.
  You must trust me, Bunny; you've known me long enough.
"    "Are you going now?"    "There's no time to lose.
  Stick to them, old chap; don't let them  suspect YOU, whatever else you do.
"  His hand lay an instant on my  shoulder; then he left me at the window, and recrossed the room.
    "I've got to go now," I heard him say; "but my friend will stay and see  this through, and I'll leave the gas on in my rooms, and my key with  the constable downstairs.
  Good luck, Mackenzie; only wish I could  stay.
"    "Good-by, sir," came in a preoccupied voice, "and many thanks.
"    Mackenzie was still busy at his window, and I remained at mine, a prey  to mingled fear and wrath, for all my knowledge of Raffles and of his  infinite resource.
  By this time I felt that I knew more or less what  he would do in any given emergency; at least I could conjecture a  characteristic course of equal cunning and audacity.
  He would return  to his rooms, put Crawshay on his guard, and--stow him away?  No--there  were such things as windows.
  Then why was Raffles going to desert us  all?  I thought of many things--lastly of a cab.
  These bedroom windows  looked into a narrow side-street; they were not very high; from them a  man might drop on to the roof of a cab--even as it passed--and be  driven away even under the noses of the police!  I pictured Raffles  driving that cab, unrecognizable in the foggy night; the vision came to  me as he passed under the window, tucking up the collar of his great  driving-coat on the way to his rooms; it was still with me when he  passed again on his way back, and stopped to hand the constable his key.
    "We're on his track," said a voice behind me.
 "He's got up on the  leads, sure enough, though how he managed it from yon window is a  myst'ry to me.
  We're going to lock up here and try what like it is  from the attics.
  So you'd better come with us if you've a mind.
"    The top floor at the Albany, as elsewhere, is devoted to the  servants--a congeries of little kitchens and cubicles, used by many as  lumber-rooms--by Raffles among the many.
  The annex in this case was,  of course, empty as the rooms below; and that was lucky, for we filled  it, what with the manager, who now joined us, and another tenant whom  he brought with him to Mackenzie's undisguised annoyance.
    "Better let in all Piccadilly at a crown a head," said he.
  "Here, my  man, out you go on the roof to make one less, and have your truncheon  handy.
"    We crowded to the little window, which Mackenzie took care to fill; and  a minute yielded no sound but the crunch and slither of constabulary  boots upon sooty slates.
  Then came a shout.
    "What now?" cried Mackenzie.
    "A rope," we heard, "hanging from the spout by a hook!"    "Sirs," purred Mackenzie, "yon's how he got up from below!  He would do  it with one o' they telescope sticks, an' I never thocht o't!  How long  a rope, my lad?"    "Quite short.
  I've got it.
"    "Did it hang over a window?  Ask him that!" cried the manager.
  "He can  see by leaning over the parapet.
"    The question was repeated by Mackenzie; a pause, then "Yes, it did.
"    "Ask him how many windows along!" shouted the manager in high  excitement.
    "Six, he says," said Mackenzie next minute; and he drew in his head and  shoulders.
  "I should just like to see those rooms, six windows along.
"    "Mr. Raffles," announced the manager after a mental calculation.
    "Is that a fact?" cried Mackenzie.
  "Then we shall have no difficulty  at all.
  He's left me his key down below.
"    The words had a dry, speculative intonation, which even then I found  time to dislike; it was as though the coincidence had already struck  the Scotchman as something more.
    "Where is Mr. Raffles?" asked the manager, as we all filed downstairs.
    "He's gone out to his dinner," said Mackenzie.
    "Are you sure?"    "I saw him go," said I.
  My heart was beating horribly.
  I would not  trust myself to speak again.
 But I wormed my way to a front place in  the little procession, and was, in fact, the second man to cross the  threshold that had been the Rubicon of my life.
  As I did so I uttered  a cry of pain, for Mackenzie had trod back heavily on my toes; in  another second I saw the reason, and saw it with another and a louder  cry.
    A man was lying at full length before the fire on his back, with a  little wound in the white forehead, and the blood draining into his  eyes.
  And the man was Raffles himself!    "Suicide," said Mackenzie calmly.
  "No--here's the poker--looks more  like murder.
"  He went on his knees and shook his head quite  cheerfully.
  "An' it's not even murder," said he, with a shade of  disgust in his matter-of-fact voice; "yon's no more than a flesh-wound,  and I have my doubts whether it felled him; but, sirs, he just stinks  o' chloryform!"    He got up and fixed his keen gray eyes upon me; my own were full of  tears, but they faced him unashamed.
    "I understood ye to say ye saw him go out?" said he sternly.
    "I saw that long driving-coat; of course, I thought he was inside it.
"    "And I could ha' sworn it was the same gent when he give me the key!"    It was the disconsolate voice of the constable in the background; on  him turned Mackenzie, white to the lips.
    "You'd think anything, some of you damned policemen," said he.
  "What's  your number, you rotter?  P 34?  You'll be hearing more of this, Mr. P  34!  If that gentleman was dead--instead of coming to himself while I'm  talking--do you know what you'd be?  Guilty of his manslaughter, you  stuck pig in buttons!  Do you know who you've let slip, butter-fingers?  Crawshay--no less--him that broke Dartmoor yesterday.
  By the God that  made ye, P 34, if I lose him I'll hound ye from the forrce!"    Working face--shaking fist--a calm man on fire.
  It was a new side of  Mackenzie, and one to mark and to digest.
  Next moment he had flounced  from our midst.
      "Difficult thing to break your own head," said Raffles later;  "infinitely easier to cut your own throat.
  Chloroform's another  matter; when you've used it on others, you know the dose to a nicety.
  So you thought I was really gone?  Poor old Bunny!  But I hope  Mackenzie saw your face?"    "He did," said I.
  I would not tell him all Mackenzie must have seen,  however.
    "That's all right.
  I wouldn't have had him miss it for worlds; and you  mustn't think me a brute, old boy, for I fear that man, and, know, we  sink or swim together.
"    "And now we sink or swim with Crawshay, too," said I dolefully.
    "Not we!" said Raffles with conviction.
  "Old Crawshay's a true  sportsman, and he'll do by us as we've done by him; besides, this makes  us quits; and I don't think, Bunny, that we'll take on the professors  again!"        THE GIFT OF THE EMPEROR    I    When the King of the Cannibal Islands made faces at Queen Victoria, and  a European monarch set the cables tingling with his compliments on the  exploit, the indignation in England was not less than the surprise, for  the thing was not so common as it has since become.
  But when it  transpired that a gift of peculiar significance was to follow the  congratulations, to give them weight, the inference prevailed that the  white potentate and the black had taken simultaneous leave of their  fourteen senses.
  For the gift was a pearl of price unparalleled,  picked aforetime by British cutlasses from a Polynesian setting, and  presented by British royalty to the sovereign who seized this  opportunity of restoring it to its original possessor.
    The incident would have been a godsend to the Press a few weeks later.
  Even in June there were leaders, letters, large headlines, leaded type;  the Daily Chronicle devoting half its literary page to a charming  drawing of the island capital which the new Pall Mall, in a leading  article headed by a pun, advised the Government to blow to flinders.
 I  was myself driving a poor but not dishonest quill at the time, and the  topic of the hour goaded me into satiric verse which obtained a better  place than anything I had yet turned out.
  I had let my flat in town,  and taken inexpensive quarters at Thames Ditton, on the plea of a  disinterested passion for the river.
    "First-rate, old boy!" said Raffles (who must needs come and see me  there), lying back in the boat while I sculled and steered.
  "I suppose  they pay you pretty well for these, eh?"    "Not a penny.
"    "Nonsense, Bunny!  I thought they paid so well?  Give them time, and  you'll get your check.
"    "Oh, no, I sha'n't," said I gloomily.
  "I've got to be content with the  honor of getting in; the editor wrote to say so, in so many words," I  added.
  But I gave the gentleman his distinguished name.
    "You don't mean to say you've written for payment already?"    No; it was the last thing I had intended to admit.
  But I had done it.
  The murder was out; there was no sense in further concealment.
  I had  written for my money because I really needed it; if he must know, I was  cursedly hard up.
  Raffles nodded as though he knew already.
  I warmed  to my woes.
  It was no easy matter to keep your end up as a raw  freelance of letters; for my part, I was afraid I wrote neither well  enough nor ill enough for success.
  I suffered from a persistent  ineffectual feeling after style.
  Verse I could manage; but it did not  pay.
  To personal paragraphs and the baser journalism I could not and I  would not stoop.
    Raffles nodded again, this time with a smile that stayed in his eyes as  he leant back watching me.
 I knew that he was thinking of other things  I had stooped to, and I thought I knew what he was going to say.
  He  had said it before so often; he was sure to say it again.
  I had my  answer ready, but evidently he was tired of asking the same question.
  His lids fell, he took up the paper he had dropped, and I sculled the  length of the old red wall of Hampton Court before he spoke again.
    "And they gave you nothing for these!  My dear Bunny, they're capital,  not only qua verses but for crystallizing your subject and putting it  in a nutshell.
  Certainly you've taught ME more about it than I knew  before.
  But is it really worth fifty thousand pounds--a single pearl?"    "A hundred, I believe; but that wouldn't scan.
"    "A hundred thousand pounds!" said Raffles, with his eyes shut.
  And  again I made certain what was coming, but again I was mistaken.
  "If  it's worth all that," he cried at last, "there would be no getting rid  of it at all; it's not like a diamond that you can subdivide.
  But I  beg your pardon, Bunny.
  I was forgetting!"    And we said no more about the emperor's gift; for pride thrives on an  empty pocket, and no privation would have drawn from me the proposal  which I had expected Raffles to make.
  My expectation had been half a  hope, though I only knew it now.
  But neither did we touch again on  what Raffles professed to have forgotten--my "apostasy," my "lapse into  virtue," as he had been pleased to call it.
  We were both a little  silent, a little constrained, each preoccupied with his own thoughts.
  It was months since we had met, and, as I saw him off towards eleven  o'clock that Sunday night, I fancied it was for more months that we  were saying good-by.
    But as we waited for the train I saw those clear eyes peering at me  under the station lamps, and when I met their glance Raffles shook his  head.
    "You don't look well on it, Bunny," said he.
 "I never did believe in  this Thames Valley.
  You want a change of air.
"    I wished I might get it.
    "What you really want is a sea voyage.
"    "And a winter at St.
 Moritz, or do you recommend Cannes or Cairo?  It's  all very well, A.
 J.
, but you forget what I told you about my funds.
"    "I forget nothing.
  I merely don't want to hurt your feelings.
  But,  look here, a sea voyage you shall have.
  I want a change myself, and  you shall come with me as my guest.
  We'll spend July in the  Mediterranean.
"    "But you're playing cricket--"    "Hang the cricket!"    "Well, if I thought you meant it--"    "Of course I mean it.
  Will you come?"    "Like a shot--if you go.
"    And I shook his hand, and waved mine in farewell, with the perfectly  good-humored conviction that I should hear no more of the matter.
  It  was a passing thought, no more, no less.
  I soon wished it were more;  that week found me wishing myself out of England for good and all.
  I  was making nothing.
  I could but subsist on the difference between the  rent I paid for my flat and the rent at which I had sublet it,  furnished, for the season.
  And the season was near its end, and  creditors awaited me in town.
  Was it possible to be entirely honest?  I had run no bills when I had money in my pocket, and the more  downright dishonesty seemed to me the less ignoble.
    But from Raffles, of course, I heard nothing more; a week went by, and  half another week; then, late on the second Wednesday night, I found a  telegram from him at my lodgings, after seeking him vainly in town, and  dining with desperation at the solitary club to which I still belonged.
    "Arrange to leave Waterloo by North German Lloyd special," he wired,  "9.
25 A.
 M.
 Monday next will meet you Southampton aboard Uhlan with  tickets am writing.
"    And write he did, a light-hearted letter enough, but full of serious  solicitude for me and for my health and prospects; a letter almost  touching in the light of our past relations, in the twilight of their  complete rupture.
  He said that he had booked two berths to Naples,  that we were bound for Capri, which was clearly the island of the  Lotos-eaters, that we would bask there together, "and for a while  forget.
"  It was a charming letter.
  I had never seen Italy; the  privilege of initiation should be his.
  No mistake was greater than to  deem it an impossible country for the summer.
 The Bay of Naples was  never so divine, and he wrote of "faery lands forlorn," as though the  poetry sprang unbidden to his pen.
  To come back to earth and prose, I  might think it unpatriotic of him to choose a German boat, but on no  other line did you receive such attention and accommodation for your  money.
  There was a hint of better reasons.
  Raffles wrote, as he had  telegraphed, from Bremen; and I gathered that the personal use of some  little influence with the authorities there had resulted in a material  reduction in our fares.
    Imagine my excitement and delight!  I managed to pay what I owed at  Thames Ditton, to squeeze a small editor for a very small check, and my  tailors for one more flannel suit.
  I remember that I broke my last  sovereign to get a box of Sullivan's cigarettes for Raffles to smoke on  the voyage.
  But my heart was as light as my purse on the Monday  morning, the fairest morning of an unfair summer, when the special  whirled me through the sunshine to the sea.
    A tender awaited us at Southampton.
  Raffles was not on board, nor did  I really look for him till we reached the liner's side.
  And then I  looked in vain.
  His face was not among the many that fringed the rail;  his hand was not of the few that waved to friends.
  I climbed aboard in  a sudden heaviness.
  I had no ticket, nor the money to pay for one.
  I  did not even know the number of my room.
  My heart was in my mouth as I  waylaid a steward and asked if a Mr. Raffles was on board.
  Thank  heaven--he was!  But where?  The man did not know, was plainly on some  other errand, and a-hunting I must go.
  But there was no sign of him on  the promenade deck, and none below in the saloon; the smoking-room was  empty but for a little German with a red moustache twisted into his  eyes; nor was Raffles in his own cabin, whither I inquired my way in  desperation, but where the sight of his own name on the baggage was  certainly a further reassurance.
  Why he himself kept in the  background, however, I could not conceive, and only sinister reasons  would suggest themselves in explanation.
    "So there you are!  I've been looking for you all over the ship!"    Despite the graven prohibition, I had tried the bridge as a last  resort; and there, indeed, was A.
 J.
 Raffles, seated on a skylight, and  leaning over one of the officers' long chairs, in which reclined a girl  in a white drill coat and skirt--a slip of a girl with a pale skin,  dark hair, and rather remarkable eyes.
  So much I noted as he rose and  quickly turned; thereupon I could think of nothing but the swift  grimace which preceded a start of well-feigned astonishment.
    "Why--BUNNY?" cried Raffles.
  "Where have YOU sprung from?"    I stammered something as he pinched my hand.
    "And are you coming in this ship?  And to Naples, too?  Well, upon my  word!  Miss Werner, may I introduce him?"    And he did so without a blush, describing me as an old schoolfellow  whom he had not seen for months, with wilful circumstance and  gratuitous detail that filled me at once with confusion, suspicion, and  revolt.
  I felt myself blushing for us both, and I did not care.
  My  address utterly deserted me, and I made no effort to recover it, to  carry the thing off.
  All I would do was to mumble such words as  Raffles actually put into my mouth, and that I doubt not with a  thoroughly evil grace.
    "So you saw my name in the list of passengers and came in search of me?  Good old Bunny; I say, though, I wish you'd share my cabin.
  I've got a  beauty on the promenade deck, but they wouldn't promise to keep me by  myself.
  We ought to see about it before they shove in some alien.
  In  any case we shall have to get out of this.
"    For a quartermaster had entered the wheelhouse, and even while we had  been speaking the pilot had taken possession of the bridge; as we  descended, the tender left us with flying handkerchiefs and shrill  good-bys; and as we bowed to Miss Werner on the promenade deck, there  came a deep, slow throbbing underfoot, and our voyage had begun.
    It did not begin pleasantly between Raffles and me.
  On deck he had  overborne my stubborn perplexity by dint of a forced though forceful  joviality; in his cabin the gloves were off.
    "You idiot," he snarled, "you've given me away again!"    "How have I given you away?"    I ignored the separate insult in his last word.
    "How?  I should have thought any clod could see that I meant us to meet  by chance!"    "After taking both tickets yourself?"    "They knew nothing about that on board; besides, I hadn't decided when  I took the tickets.
"    "Then you should have let me know when you did decide.
  You lay your  plans, and never say a word, and expect me to tumble to them by light  of nature.
  How was I to know you had anything on?"    I had turned the tables with some effect.
  Raffles almost hung his head.
    "The fact is, Bunny, I didn't mean you to know.
 You--you've grown such  a pious rabbit in your old age!"    My nickname and his tone went far to mollify me, other things went  farther, but I had much to forgive him still.
    "If you were afraid of writing," I pursued, "it was your business to  give me the tip the moment I set foot on board.
  I would have taken it  all right.
  I am not so virtuous as all that.
"    Was it my imagination, or did Raffles look slightly ashamed?  If so, it  was for the first and last time in all the years I knew him; nor can I  swear to it even now.
    "That," said he, "was the very thing I meant to do--to lie in wait in  my room and get you as you passed.
  But--"    "You were better engaged?"    "Say otherwise.
"    "The charming Miss Werner?"    "She is quite charming.
"    "Most Australian girls are," said I.
    "How did you know she was one?" he cried.
    "I heard her speak.
"    "Brute!" said Raffles, laughing; "she has no more twang than you have.
  Her people are German, she has been to school in Dresden, and is on her  way out alone.
"    "Money?" I inquired.
    "Confound you!" he said, and, though he was laughing, I thought it was  a point at which the subject might be changed.
    "Well," I said, "it wasn't for Miss Werner you wanted us to play  strangers, was it?  You have some deeper game than that, eh?"    "I suppose I have.
"    "Then hadn't you better tell me what it is?"    Raffles treated me to the old cautious scrutiny that I knew so well;  the very familiarity of it, after all these months, set me smiling in a  way that might have reassured him; for dimly already I divined his  enterprise.
    "It won't send you off in the pilot's boat, Bunny?"    "Not quite.
"    "Then--you remember the pearl you wrote the--"    I did not wait for him to finish his sentence.
    "You've got it!" I cried, my face on fire, for I caught sight of it  that moment in the stateroom mirror.
    Raffles seemed taken aback.
    "Not yet," said he; "but I mean to have it before we get to Naples.
"    "Is it on board?"    "Yes.
"    "But how--where--who's got it?"    "A little German officer, a whipper-snapper with perpendicular  mustaches.
"    "I saw him in the smoke-room.
"    "That's the chap; he's always there.
  Herr Captain Wilhelm von Heumann,  if you look in the list.
  Well, he's the special envoy of the emperor,  and he's taking the pearl out with him.
"    "You found this out in Bremen?"    "No, in Berlin, from a newspaper man I know there.
  I'm ashamed to tell  you, Bunny, that I went there on purpose!"    I burst out laughing.
    "You needn't be ashamed.
  You are doing the very thing I was rather  hoping you were going to propose the other day on the river.
"    "You were HOPING it?" said Raffles, with his eyes wide open.
  Indeed,  it was his turn to show surprise, and mine to be much more ashamed than  I felt.
    "Yes," I answered, "I was quite keen on the idea, but I wasn't going to  propose it.
"    "Yet you would have listened to me the other day?"    Certainly I would, and I told him so without reserve; not brazenly, you  understand; not even now with the gusto of a man who savors such an  adventure for its own sake, but doggedly, defiantly, through my teeth,  as one who had tried to live honestly and failed.
  And, while I was  about it, I told him much more.
  Eloquently enough, I daresay, I gave  him chapter and verse of my hopeless struggle, my inevitable defeat;  for hopeless and inevitable they were to a man with my record, even  though that record was written only in one's own soul.
  It was the old  story of the thief trying to turn honest man; the thing was against  nature, and there was an end of it.
    Raffles entirely disagreed with me.
  He shook his head over my  conventional view.
  Human nature was a board of checkers; why not  reconcile one's self to alternate black and white?  Why desire to be  all one thing or all the other, like our forefathers on the stage or in  the old-fashioned fiction?  For his part, he enjoyed himself on all  squares of the board, and liked the light the better for the shade.
  My  conclusion he considered absurd.
    "But you err in good company, Bunny, for all the cheap moralists who  preach the same twaddle: old Virgil was the first and worst offender of  you all.
  I back myself to climb out of Avernus any day I like, and  sooner or later I shall climb out for good.
  I suppose I can't very  well turn myself into a Limited Liability Company.
  But I could retire  and settle down and live blamelessly ever after.
 I'm not sure that it  couldn't be done on this pearl alone!"    "Then you don't still think it too remarkable to sell?"    "We might take a fishery and haul it up with smaller fry.
  It would  come after months of ill luck, just as we were going to sell the  schooner; by Jove, it would be the talk of the Pacific!"    "Well, we've got to get it first.
  Is this von What's-his-name a  formidable cuss?"    "More so than he looks; and he has the cheek of the devil!"    As he spoke a white drill skirt fluttered past the open state-room  door, and I caught a glimpse of an upturned moustache beyond.
    "But is he the chap we have to deal with?  Won't the pearl be in the  purser's keeping?"    Raffles stood at the door, frowning out upon the Solent, but for an  instant he turned to me with a sniff.
    "My good fellow, do you suppose the whole ship's company knows there's  a gem like that aboard?  You said that it was worth a hundred thousand  pounds; in Berlin they say it's priceless.
 I doubt if the skipper  himself knows that von Heumann has it on him.
"    "And he has?"    "Must have.
"    "Then we have only him to deal with?"    He answered me without a word.
  Something white was fluttering past  once more, and Raffles, stepping forth, made the promenaders three.
      II    I do not ask to set foot aboard a finer steamship than the Uhlan of the  Norddeutscher Lloyd, to meet a kindlier gentleman than her commander,  or better fellows than his officers.
  This much at least let me have  the grace to admit.
  I hated the voyage.
  It was no fault of anybody  connected with the ship; it was no fault of the weather, which was  monotonously ideal.
  Not even in my own heart did the reason reside;  conscience and I were divorced at last, and the decree made absolute.
  With my scruples had fled all fear, and I was ready to revel between  bright skies and sparkling sea with the light-hearted detachment of  Raffles himself.
  It was Raffles himself who prevented me, but not  Raffles alone.
  It was Raffles and that Colonial minx on her way home  from school.
    What he could see in her--but that begs the question.
  Of course he saw  no more than I did, but to annoy me, or perhaps to punish me for my  long defection, he must turn his back on me and devote himself to this  chit from Southampton to the Mediterranean.
  They were always together.
  It was too absurd.
  After breakfast they would begin, and go on until  eleven or twelve at night; there was no intervening hour at which you  might not hear her nasal laugh, or his quiet voice talking soft  nonsense into her ear.
  Of course it was nonsense!  Is it conceivable  that a man like Raffles, with his knowledge of the world, and his  experience of women (a side of his character upon which I have  purposely never touched, for it deserves another volume); is it  credible, I ask, that such a man could find anything but nonsense to  talk by the day together to a giddy young schoolgirl? I would not be  unfair for the world.
    I think I have admitted that the young person had points.
 Her eyes, I  suppose, were really fine, and certainly the shape of the little brown  face was charming, so far as mere contour can charm.
    I admit also more audacity than I cared about, with enviable health,  mettle, and vitality.
  I may not have occasion to report any of this  young lady's speeches (they would scarcely bear it), and am therefore  the more anxious to describe her without injustice.
 I confess to some  little prejudice against her.
  I resented her success with Raffles, of  whom, in consequence, I saw less and less each day.
  It is a mean thing  to have to confess, but there must have been something not unlike  jealousy rankling within me.
    Jealousy there was in another quarter--crude, rampant, undignified  jealousy.
  Captain von Heumann would twirl his mustaches into twin  spires, shoot his white cuffs over his rings, and stare at me  insolently through his rimless eyeglasses; we ought to have consoled  each other, but we never exchanged a syllable.
  The captain had a  murderous scar across one of his cheeks, a present from Heidelberg, and  I used to think how he must long to have Raffles there to serve the  same.
  It was not as though von Heumann never had his innings.
 Raffles  let him go in several times a day, for the malicious pleasure of  bowling him out as he was "getting set"; those were his words when I  taxed him disingenuously with obnoxious conduct towards a German on a  German boat.
    "You'll make yourself disliked on board!"    "By von Heumann merely.
"    "But is that wise when he's the man we've got to diddle?"    "The wisest thing I ever did.
  To have chummed up with him would have  been fatal--the common dodge.
"    I was consoled, encouraged, almost content.
  I had feared Raffles was  neglecting things, and I told him so in a burst.
  Here we were near  Gibraltar, and not a word since the Solent.
  He shook his head with a  smile.
    "Plenty of time, Bunny, plenty of time.
  We can do nothing before we  get to Genoa, and that won't be till Sunday night.
  The voyage is still  young, and so are we; let's make the most of things while we can.
"    It was after dinner on the promenade deck, and as Raffles spoke he  glanced sharply fore and aft, leaving me next moment with a step full  of purpose.
  I retired to the smoking-room, to smoke and read in a  corner, and to watch von Heumann, who very soon came to drink beer and  to sulk in another.
    Few travellers tempt the Red Sea at midsummer; the Uhlan was very empty  indeed.
  She had, however, but a limited supply of cabins on the  promenade deck, and there was just that excuse for my sharing Raffles's  room.
  I could have had one to myself downstairs, but I must be up  above.
  Raffles had insisted that I should insist on the point.
 So we  were together, I think, without suspicion, though also without any  object that I could see.
    On the Sunday afternoon I was asleep in my berth, the lower one, when  the curtains were shaken by Raffles, who was in his shirt-sleeves on  the settee.
    "Achilles sulking in his bunk!"    "What else is there to do?" I asked him as I stretched and yawned.
  I  noted, however, the good-humor of his tone, and did my best to catch it.
    "I have found something else, Bunny.
"    "I daresay!"    "You misunderstand me.
  The whipper-snapper's making his century this  afternoon.
  I've had other fish to fry.
"    I swung my legs over the side of my berth and sat forward, as he was  sitting, all attention.
  The inner door, a grating, was shut and  bolted, and curtained like the open porthole.
    "We shall be at Genoa before sunset," continued Raffles.
  "It's the  place where the deed's got to be done.
"    "So you still mean to do it?"    "Did I ever say I didn't?"    "You have said so little either way.
"    "Advisedly so, my dear Bunny; why spoil a pleasure trip by talking  unnecessary shop?  But now the time has come.
  It must be done at Genoa  or not at all.
"    "On land?"    "No, on board, to-morrow night.
  To-night would do, but to-morrow is  better, in case of mishap.
  If we were forced to use violence we could  get away by the earliest train, and nothing be known till the ship was  sailing and von Heumann found dead or drugged--"    "Not dead!" I exclaimed.
    "Of course not," assented Raffles, "or there would be no need for us to  bolt; but if we should have to bolt, Tuesday morning is our time, when  this ship has got to sail, whatever happens.
  But I don't anticipate  any violence.
  Violence is a confession of terrible incompetence.
  In  all these years how many blows have you known me to strike?  Not one, I  believe; but I have been quite ready to kill my man every time, if the  worst came to the worst.
"    I asked him how he proposed to enter von Heumann's state-room  unobserved, and even through the curtained gloom of ours his face  lighted up.
    "Climb into my bunk, Bunny, and you shall see.
"    I did so, but could see nothing.
  Raffles reached across me and tapped  the ventilator, a sort of trapdoor in the wall above his bed, some  eighteen inches long and half that height.
  It opened outwards into the  ventilating shaft.
    "That," said he, "is our door to fortune.
  Open it if you like; you  won't see much, because it doesn't open far; but loosening a couple of  screws will set that all right.
  The shaft, as you may see, is more or  less bottomless; you pass under it whenever you go to your bath, and  the top is a skylight on the bridge.
  That's why this thing has to be  done while we're at Genoa, because they keep no watch on the bridge in  port.
  The ventilator opposite ours is von Heumann's.
  It again will  only mean a couple of screws, and there's a beam to stand on while you  work.
"    "But if anybody should look up from below?"    "It's extremely unlikely that anybody will be astir below, so unlikely  that we can afford to chance it.
  No, I can't have you there to make  sure.
  The great point is that neither of us should be seen from the  time we turn in.
  A couple of ship's boys do sentry-go on these decks,  and they shall be our witnesses; by Jove, it'll be the biggest mystery  that ever was made!"    "If von Heumann doesn't resist.
"    "Resist!  He won't get the chance.
  He drinks too much beer to sleep  light, and nothing is so easy as to chloroform a heavy sleeper; you've  even done it yourself on an occasion of which it's perhaps unfair to  remind you.
  Von Heumann will be past sensation almost as soon as I get  my hand through his ventilator.
  I shall crawl in over his body, Bunny,  my boy!"    "And I?"    "You will hand me what I want and hold the fort in case of accidents,  and generally lend me the moral support you've made me require.
  It's a  luxury, Bunny, but I found it devilish difficult to do without it after  you turned pi!"    He said that Von Heumann was certain to sleep with a bolted door, which  he, of course, would leave unbolted, and spoke of other ways of laying  a false scent while rifling the cabin.
  Not that Raffles anticipated a  tiresome search.
  The pearl would be about von Heumann's person; in  fact, Raffles knew exactly where and in what he kept it.
 Naturally I  asked how he could have come by such knowledge, and his answer led up  to a momentary unpleasantness.
    "It's a very old story, Bunny.
  I really forget in what Book it comes;  I'm only sure of the Testament.
  But Samson was the unlucky hero, and  one Delilah the heroine.
"    And he looked so knowing that I could not be in a moment's doubt as to  his meaning.
    "So the fair Australian has been playing Delilah?" said I.
    "In a very harmless, innocent sort of way.
"    "She got his mission out of him?"    "Yes, I've forced him to score all the points he could, and that was  his great stroke, as I hoped it would be.
  He has even shown Amy the  pearl.
"    "Amy, eh! and she promptly told you?"    "Nothing of the kind.
  What makes you think so?  I had the greatest  trouble in getting it out of her.
"    His tone should have been a sufficient warning to me.
  I had not the  tact to take it as such.
  At last I knew the meaning of his furious  flirtation, and stood wagging my head and shaking my finger, blinded to  his frowns by my own enlightenment.
    "Wily worm!" said I.
  "Now I see through it all; how dense I've been!"    "Sure you're not still?"    "No; now I understand what has beaten me all the week.
  I simply  couldn't fathom what you saw in that little girl.
  I never dreamt it  was part of the game.
"    "So you think it was that and nothing more?"    "You deep old dog--of course I do!"    "You didn't know she was the daughter of a wealthy squatter?"    "There are wealthy women by the dozen who would marry you to-morrow.
"    "It doesn't occur to you that I might like to draw stumps, start clean,  and live happily ever after--in the bush?"    "With that voice?  It certainly does not!"    "Bunny!" he cried, so fiercely that I braced myself for a blow.
    But no more followed.
    "Do you think you would live happily?" I made bold to ask him.
    "God knows!" he answered.
  And with that he left me, to marvel at his  look and tone, and, more than ever, at the insufficiently exciting  cause.
      III    Of all the mere feats of cracksmanship which I have seen Raffles  perform, at once the most delicate and most difficult was that which he  accomplished between one and two o'clock on the Tuesday morning, aboard  the North German steamer Uhlan, lying at anchor in Genoa harbor.
    Not a hitch occurred.
  Everything had been foreseen; everything  happened as I had been assured everything must.
  Nobody was about  below, only the ship's boys on deck, and nobody on the bridge.
  It was  twenty-five minutes past one when Raffles, without a stitch of clothing  on his body, but with a glass phial, corked with cotton-wool, between  his teeth, and a tiny screw-driver behind his ear, squirmed feet first  through the ventilator over his berth; and it was nineteen minutes to  two when he returned, head first, with the phial still between his  teeth, and the cotton-wool rammed home to still the rattling of that  which lay like a great gray bean within.
  He had taken screws out and  put them in again; he had unfastened von Heumann's ventilator and had  left it fast as he had found it--fast as he instantly proceeded to make  his own.
  As for von Heumann, it had been enough to place the drenched  wad first on his mustache, and then to hold it between his gaping lips;  thereafter the intruder had climbed both ways across his shins without  eliciting a groan.
    And here was the prize--this pearl as large as a filbert--with a pale  pink tinge like a lady's fingernail--this spoil of a filibustering  age--this gift from a European emperor to a South Sea chief.
 We gloated  over it when all was snug.
  We toasted it in whiskey and soda-water  laid in overnight in view of the great moment.
  But the moment was  greater, more triumphant, than our most sanguine dreams.
  All we had  now to do was to secrete the gem (which Raffles had prised from its  setting, replacing the latter), so that we could stand the strictest  search and yet take it ashore with us at Naples; and this Raffles was  doing when I turned in.
  I myself would have landed incontinently, that  night, at Genoa and bolted with the spoil; he would not hear of it, for  a dozen good reasons which will be obvious.
    On the whole I do not think that anything was discovered or suspected  before we weighed anchor; but I cannot be sure.
  It is difficult to  believe that a man could be chloroformed in his sleep and feel no  tell-tale effects, sniff no suspicious odor, in the morning.
  Nevertheless, von Heumann reappeared as though nothing had happened to  him, his German cap over his eyes and his mustaches brushing the peak.
  And by ten o'clock we were quit of Genoa; the last lean, blue-chinned  official had left our decks; the last fruitseller had been beaten off  with bucketsful of water and left cursing us from his boat; the last  passenger had come aboard at the last moment--a fussy graybeard who  kept the big ship waiting while he haggled with his boatman over half a  lira.
  But at length we were off, the tug was shed, the lighthouse  passed, and Raffles and I leaned together over the rail, watching our  shadows on the pale green, liquid, veined marble that again washed the  vessel's side.
    Von Heumann was having his innings once more; it was part of the design  that he should remain in all day, and so postpone the inevitable hour;  and, though the lady looked bored, and was for ever glancing in our  direction, he seemed only too willing to avail himself of his  opportunities.
 But Raffles was moody and ill-at-ease.
  He had not the  air of a successful man.
  I could but opine that the impending parting  at Naples sat heavily on his spirit.
    He would neither talk to me, nor would he let me go.
    "Stop where you are, Bunny.
  I've things to tell you.
  Can you swim?"    "A bit.
"    "Ten miles?"    "Ten?" I burst out laughing.
  "Not one!  Why do you ask?"    "We shall be within a ten miles' swim of the shore most of the day.
"    "What on earth are you driving at, Raffles?"    "Nothing; only I shall swim for it if the worst comes to the worst.
  I  suppose you can't swim under water at all?"    I did not answer his question.
  I scarcely heard it: cold beads were  bursting through my skin.
    "Why should the worst come to the worst?" I whispered.
  "We aren't  found out, are we?"    "No.
"    "Then why speak as though we were?"    "We may be; an old enemy of ours is on board.
"    "An old enemy?"    "Mackenzie.
"    "Never!"    "The man with the beard who came aboard last.
"    "Are you sure?"    "Sure!  I was only sorry to see you didn't recognize him too.
"    I took my handkerchief to my face; now that I thought of it, there had  been something familiar in the old man's gait, as well as something  rather youthful for his apparent years; his very beard seemed  unconvincing, now that I recalled it in the light of this horrible  revelation.
  I looked up and down the deck, but the old man was nowhere  to be seen.
    "That's the worst of it," said Raffles.
  "I saw him go into the  captain's cabin twenty minutes ago.
"    "But what can have brought him?" I cried miserably.
  "Can it be a  coincidence--is it somebody else he's after?"    Raffles shook his head.
    "Hardly this time.
"    "Then you think he's after you?"    "I've been afraid of it for some weeks.
"    "Yet there you stand!"    "What am I to do?  I don't want to swim for it before I must.
  I begin  to wish I'd taken your advice, Bunny, and left the ship at Genoa.
  But  I've not the smallest doubt that Mac was watching both ship and station  till the last moment.
  That's why he ran it so fine.
"    He took a cigarette and handed me the case, but I shook my head  impatiently.
    "I still don't understand," said I.
  "Why should he be after you?  He  couldn't come all this way about a jewel which was perfectly safe for  all he knew.
  What's your own theory?"    "Simply that he's been on my track for some time, probably ever since  friend Crawshay slipped clean through his fingers last November.
  There  have been other indications.
  I am really not unprepared for this.
  But  it can only be pure suspicion.
  I'll defy him to bring anything home,  and I'll defy him to find the pearl!  Theory, my dear Bunny?  I know  how he's got here as well as though I'd been inside that Scotchman's  skin, and I know what he'll do next.
  He found out I'd gone abroad, and  looked for a motive; he found out about von Heumann and his mission,  and there was his motive cut-and-dried.
  Great chance--to nab me on a  new job altogether.
  But he won't do it, Bunny; mark my words, he'll  search the ship and search us all, when the loss is known; but he'll  search in vain.
  And there's the skipper beckoning the whippersnapper  to his cabin: the fat will be in the fire in five minutes!"    Yet there was no conflagration, no fuss, no searching of the  passengers, no whisper of what had happened in the air; instead of a  stir there was portentous peace; and it was clear to me that Raffles  was not a little disturbed at the falsification of all his predictions.
  There was something sinister in silence under such a loss, and the  silence was sustained for hours during which Mackenzie never  reappeared.
  But he was abroad during the luncheon-hour--he was in our  cabin!  I had left my book in Raffles's berth, and in taking it after  lunch I touched the quilt.
  It was warm from the recent pressure of  flesh and blood, and on an instinct I sprang to the ventilator; as I  opened it the ventilator opposite was closed with a snap.
    I waylaid Raffles.
  "All right!  Let him find the pearl.
"    "Have you dumped it overboard?"    "That's a question I shan't condescend to answer.
"    He turned on his heel, and at subsequent intervals I saw him making the  most of his last afternoon with the inevitable Miss Werner.
  I remember  that she looked both cool and smart in quite a simple affair of brown  holland, which toned well with her complexion, and was cleverly  relieved with touches of scarlet.
  I quite admired her that afternoon,  for her eyes were really very good, and so were her teeth, yet I had  never admired her more directly in my own despite.
  For I passed them  again and again in order to get a word with Raffles, to tell him I knew  there was danger in the wind; but he would not so much as catch my eye.
  So at last I gave it up.
  And I saw him next in the captain's cabin.
    They had summoned him first; he had gone in smiling; and smiling I  found him when they summoned me.
  The state-room was spacious, as  befitted that of a commander.
  Mackenzie sat on the settee, his beard  in front of him on the polished table; but a revolver lay in front of  the captain; and, when I had entered, the chief officer, who had  summoned me, shut the door and put his back to it.
 Von Heumann  completed the party, his fingers busy with his mustache.
    Raffles greeted me.
    "This is a great joke!" he cried.
  "You remember the pearl you were so  keen about, Bunny, the emperor's pearl, the pearl money wouldn't buy?  It seems it was entrusted to our little friend here, to take out to  Canoodle Dum, and the poor little chap's gone and lost it; ergo, as  we're Britishers, they think we've got it!"    "But I know ye have," put in Mackenzie, nodding to his beard.
    "You will recognize that loyal and patriotic voice," said Raffles.
  "Mon, 'tis our auld acquaintance Mackenzie, o' Scoteland Yarrd an'  Scoteland itsel'!"    "Dat is enough," cried the captain.
  "Have you submid to be searge, or  do I vorce you?"    "What you will," said Raffles, "but it will do you no harm to give us  fair play first.
  You accuse us of breaking into Captain von Heumann's  state-room during the small hours of this morning, and abstracting from  it this confounded pearl.
  Well, I can prove that I was in my own room  all night long, and I have no doubt my friend can prove the same.
"    "Most certainly I can," said I indignantly.
 "The ship's boys can bear  witness to that.
"    Mackenzie laughed, and shook his head at his reflection in the polished  mahogany.
    "That was ver clever," said he, "and like enough it would ha' served ye  had I not stepped aboard.
  But I've just had a look at they  ventilators, and I think I know how ye worrked it.
  Anyway, captain, it  makes no matter.
  I'll just be clappin' the derbies on these young  sparks, an' then--"    "By what right?" roared Raffles, in a ringing voice, and I never saw  his face in such a blaze.
 "Search us if you like; search every scrap  and stitch we possess; but you dare to lay a finger on us without a  warrant!"    "I wouldna' dare," said Mackenzie, as he fumbled in his breast pocket,  and Raffles dived his hand into his own.
  "Haud his wrist!" shouted the  Scotchman; and the huge Colt that had been with us many a night, but  had never been fired in my hearing, clattered on the table and was  raked in by the captain.
    "All right," said Raffles savagely to the mate.
 "You can let go now.
  I  won't try it again.
  Now, Mackenzie, let's see your warrant!"    "Ye'll no mishandle it?"    "What good would that do me?  Let me see it," said Raffles,  peremptorily, and the detective obeyed.
  Raffles raised his eyebrows as  he perused the document; his mouth hardened, but suddenly relaxed; and  it was with a smile and a shrug that he returned the paper.
    "Wull that do for ye?" inquired Mackenzie.
    "It may.
  I congratulate you, Mackenzie; it's a strong hand, at any  rate.
  Two burglaries and the Melrose necklace, Bunny!"  And he turned  to me with a rueful smile.
    "An' all easy to prove," said the Scotchman, pocketing the warrant.
  "I've one o' these for you," he added, nodding to me, "only not such a  long one.
"    "To think," said the captain reproachfully, "that my shib should be  made a den of thiefs!  It shall be a very disagreeable madder, I have  been obliged to pud you both in irons until we get to Nables.
"    "Surely not!" exclaimed Raffles.
  "Mackenzie, intercede with him; don't  give your countrymen away before all hands!  Captain, we can't escape;  surely you could hush it up for the night?  Look here, here's  everything I have in my pockets; you empty yours, too, Bunny, and they  shall strip us stark if they suspect we've weapons up our sleeves.
 All  I ask is that we are allowed to get out of this without gyves upon our  wrists!"    "Webbons you may not have," said the captain; "but wad aboud der bearl  dat you were sdealing?"    "You shall have it!" cried Raffles.
  "You shall have it this minute if  you guarantee no public indignity on board!"    "That I'll see to," said Mackenzie, "as long as you behave yourselves.
  There now, where is't?"    "On the table under your nose.
"    My eyes fell with the rest, but no pearl was there; only the contents  of our pockets--our watches, pocket-books, pencils, penknives,  cigarette cases--lay on the shiny table along with the revolvers  already mentioned.
    "Ye're humbuggin' us," said Mackenzie.
 "What's the use?"    "I'm doing nothing of the sort," laughed Raffles.
  "I'm testing you.
  Where's the harm?"    "It's here, joke apart?"    "On that table, by all my gods.
"    Mackenzie opened the cigarette cases and shook each particular  cigarette.
  Thereupon Raffles prayed to be allowed to smoke one, and,  when his prayer was heard, observed that the pearl had been on the  table much longer than the cigarettes.
  Mackenzie promptly caught up  the Colt and opened the chamber in the butt.
    "Not there, not there," said Raffles; "but you're getting hot.
  Try the  cartridges.
"    Mackenzie emptied them into his palm, and shook each one at his ear  without result.
    "Oh, give them to me!"    And, in an instant, Raffles had found the right one, had bitten out the  bullet, and placed the emperor's pearl with a flourish in the centre of  the table.
    "After that you will perhaps show me such little consideration as is in  your power.
  Captain, I have been a bit of a villain, as you see, and  as such I am ready and willing to lie in irons all night if you deem it  requisite for the safety of the ship.
  All I ask is that you do me one  favor first.
"    "That shall debend on wad der vafour has been.
"    "Captain, I've done a worse thing aboard your ship than any of you  know.
  I have become engaged to be married, and I want to say good-by!"    I suppose we were all equally amazed; but the only one to express his  amazement was von Heumann, whose deep-chested German oath was almost  his first contribution to the proceedings.
  He was not slow to follow  it, however, with a vigorous protest against the proposed farewell; but  he was overruled, and the masterful prisoner had his way.
 He was to  have five minutes with the girl, while the captain and Mackenzie stood  within range (but not earshot), with their revolvers behind their  backs.
  As we were moving from the cabin, in a body, he stopped and  gripped my hand.
    "So I 've let you in at last, Bunny--at last and after all!  If you  knew how sorry I am.
.
.
.
 But you won't get much--I don't see why you  should get anything at all.
  Can you forgive me? This may be for years,  and it may be for ever, you know!  You were a good pal always when it  came to the scratch; some day or other you mayn't be so sorry to  remember you were a good pal at the last!"    There was a meaning in his eye that I understood; and my teeth were  set, and my nerve strung ready, as I wrung that strong and cunning hand  for the last time in my life.
    How that last scene stays with me, and will stay to my death!  How I  see every detail, every shadow on the sunlit deck!  We were among the  islands that dot the course from Genoa to Naples; that was Elba falling  back on our starboard quarter, that purple patch with the hot sun  setting over it.
  The captain's cabin opened to starboard, and the  starboard promenade deck, sheeted with sunshine and scored with shadow,  was deserted, but for the group of which I was one, and for the pale,  slim, brown figure further aft with Raffles.
  Engaged?  I could not  believe it, cannot to this day.
 Yet there they stood together, and we  did not hear a word; there they stood out against the sunset, and the  long, dazzling highway of sunlit sea that sparkled from Elba to the  Uhlan's plates; and their shadows reached almost to our feet.
    Suddenly--an instant--and the thing was done--a thing I have never  known whether to admire or to detest.
  He caught her--he kissed her  before us all--then flung her from him so that she almost fell.
  It was  that action which foretold the next.
 The mate sprang after him, and I  sprang after the mate.
    Raffles was on the rail, but only just.
    "Hold him, Bunny!" he cried.
  "Hold him tight!"    And, as I obeyed that last behest with all my might, without a thought  of what I was doing, save that he bade me do it, I saw his hands shoot  up and his head bob down, and his lithe, spare body cut the sunset as  cleanly and precisely as though he had plunged at his leisure from a  diver's board!                                         Of what followed on deck I can tell you nothing, for I was not there.
  Nor can my final punishment, my long imprisonment, my everlasting  disgrace, concern or profit you, beyond the interest and advantage to  be gleaned from the knowledge that I at least had my deserts.
  But one  thing I must set down, believe it who will--one more thing only and I  am done.
    It was into a second-class cabin, on the starboard side, that I was  promptly thrust in irons, and the door locked upon me as though I were  another Raffles.
  Meanwhile a boat was lowered, and the sea scoured to  no purpose, as is doubtless on record elsewhere.
  But either the  setting sun, flashing over the waves, must have blinded all eyes, or  else mine were victims of a strange illusion.
    For the boat was back, the screw throbbing, and the prisoner peering  through his porthole across the sunlit waters that he believed had  closed for ever over his comrade's head.
  Suddenly the sun sank behind  the Island of Elba, the lane of dancing sunlight was instantaneously  quenched and swallowed in the trackless waste, and in the middle  distance, already miles astern, either my sight deceived me or a black  speck bobbed amid the gray.
 The bugle had blown for dinner: it may well  be that all save myself had ceased to strain an eye.
 And now I lost  what I had found, now it rose, now sank, and now I gave it up utterly.
  Yet anon it would rise again, a mere mote dancing in the dim gray  distance, drifting towards a purple island, beneath a fading western  sky, streaked with dead gold and cerise.
  And night fell before I knew  whether it was a human head or not.

  He lived with his father and  mother in a cottage built on a mountain, and he worked with his father  inside the mountain.
    A mountain is a strange and awful thing.
  In old times, without knowing  so much of their strangeness and awfulness as we do, people were yet  more afraid of mountains.
  But then somehow they had not come to see  how beautiful they are as well as awful, and they hated them--and what  people hate they must fear.
  Now that we have learned to look at them  with admiration, perhaps we do not feel quite awe enough of them.
  To  me they are beautiful terrors.
    I will try to tell you what they are.
  They are portions of the heart  of the earth that have escaped from the dungeon down below, and rushed  up and out.
  For the heart of the earth is a great wallowing mass, not  of blood, as in the hearts of men and animals, but of glowing hot,  melted metals and stones.
  And as our hearts keep us alive, so that  great lump of heat keeps the earth alive: it is a huge power of buried  sunlight--that is what it is.
    Now think: out of that cauldron, where all the bubbles would be as big  as the Alps if it could get room for its boiling, certain bubbles have  bubbled out and escaped--up and away, and there they stand in the cool,  cold sky--mountains.
  Think of the change, and you will no more wonder  that there should be something awful about the very look of a mountain:  from the darkness--for where the light has nothing to shine upon, much  the same as darkness--from the heat, from the endless tumult of boiling  unrest--up, with a sudden heavenward shoot, into the wind, and the  cold, and the starshine, and a cloak of snow that lies like ermine  above the blue-green mail of the glaciers; and the great sun, their  grandfather, up there in the sky; and their little old cold aunt, the  moon, that comes wandering about the house at night; and everlasting  stillness, except for the wind that turns the rocks and caverns into a  roaring organ for the young archangels that are studying how to let out  the pent-up praises of their hearts, and the molten music of the  streams, rushing ever from the bosoms of the glaciers fresh born.
    Think, too, of the change in their own substance--no longer molten and  soft, heaving and glowing, but hard and shining and cold.
 Think of the  creatures scampering over and burrowing in it, and the birds building  their nests upon it, and the trees growing out of its sides, like hair  to clothe it, and the lovely grass in the valleys, and the gracious  flowers even at the very edge of its armour of ice, like the rich  embroidery of the garment below, and the rivers galloping down the  valleys in a tumult of white and green!  And along with all these,  think of the terrible precipices down which the traveller may fall and  be lost, and the frightful gulfs of blue air cracked in the glaciers,  and the dark profound lakes, covered like little arctic oceans with  floating lumps of ice.
    All this outside the mountain!  But the inside, who shall tell what  lies there?  Caverns of awfullest solitude, their walls miles thick,  sparkling with ores of gold or silver, copper or iron, tin or mercury,  studded perhaps with precious stones--perhaps a brook, with eyeless  fish in it, running, running ceaselessly, cold and babbling, through  banks crusted with carbuncles and golden topazes, or over a gravel of  which some of the stones arc rubies and emeralds, perhaps diamonds and  sapphires--who can tell?--and whoever can't tell is free to think--all  waiting to flash, waiting for millions of ages--ever since the earth  flew off from the sun, a great blot of fire, and began to cool.
    Then there are caverns full of water, numbingly cold, fiercely  hot--hotter than any boiling water.
  From some of these the water  cannot get out, and from others it runs in channels as the blood in the  body: little veins bring it down from the ice above into the great  caverns of the mountain's heart, whence the arteries let it out again,  gushing in pipes and clefts and ducts of all shapes and kinds, through  and through its bulk, until it springs newborn to the light, and rushes  down the Mountainside in torrents, and down the valleys in  rivers--down, down, rejoicing, to the mighty lungs of the world, that  is the sea, where it is tossed in storms and cyclones, heaved up in  billows, twisted in waterspouts, dashed to mist upon rocks, beaten by  millions of tails, and breathed by millions of gills, whence at last,  melted into vapour by the sun, it is lifted up pure into the air, and  borne by the servant winds back to the mountaintops and the snow, the  solid ice, and the molten stream.
    Well, when the heart of the earth has thus come rushing up among her  children, bringing with it gifts of all that she possesses, then  straightway into it rush her children to see what they can find there.
  With pickaxe and spade and crowbar, with boring chisel and blasting  powder, they force their way back: is it to search for what toys they  may have left in their long-forgotten nurseries? Hence the mountains  that lift their heads into the clear air, and are dotted over with the  dwellings of men, are tunnelled and bored in the darkness of their  bosoms by the dwellers in the houses which they hold up to the sun and  air.
    Curdie and his father were of these: their business was to bring to  light hidden things; they sought silver in the rock and found it, and  carried it out.
  Of the many other precious things in their mountain  they knew little or nothing.
  Silver ore was what they were sent to  find, and in darkness and danger they found it.
  But oh, how sweet was  the air on the mountain face when they came out at sunset to go home to  wife and mother!  They did breathe deep then!    The mines belonged to the king of the country, and the miners were his  servants, working under his overseers and officers.
  He was a real  king--that is, one who ruled for the good of his people and not to  please himself, and he wanted the silver not to buy rich things for  himself, but to help him to govern the country, and pay the ones that  defended it from certain troublesome neighbours, and the judges whom he  set to portion out righteousness among the people, that so they might  learn it themselves, and come to do without judges at all.
  Nothing  that could be got from the heart of the earth could have been put to  better purposes than the silver the king's miners got for him.
  There  were people in the country who, when it came into their hands, degraded  it by locking it up in a chest, and then it grew diseased and was  called mammon, and bred all sorts of quarrels; but when first it left  the king's hands it never made any but friends, and the air of the  world kept it clean.
    About a year before this story began, a series of very remarkable  events had just ended.
  I will narrate as much of them as will serve to  show the tops of the roots of my tree.
    Upon the mountain, on one of its many claws, stood a grand old house,  half farmhouse, half castle, belonging to the king; and there his only  child, the Princess Irene, had been brought up till she was nearly nine  years old, and would doubtless have continued much longer, but for the  strange events to which I have referred.
    At that time the hollow places of the mountain were inhabited by  creatures called goblins, who for various reasons and in various ways  made themselves troublesome to all, but to the little princess  dangerous.
  Mainly by the watchful devotion and energy of Curdie,  however, their designs had been utterly defeated, and made to recoil  upon themselves to their own destruction, so that now there were very  few of them left alive, and the miners did not believe there was a  single goblin remaining in the whole inside of the mountain.
    The king had been so pleased with the boy--then approaching thirteen  years of age--that when he carried away his daughter he asked him to  accompany them; but he was still better pleased with him when he found  that he preferred staying with his father and mother.
  He was a right  good king and knew that the love of a boy who would not leave his  father and mother to be made a great man was worth ten thousand offers  to die for his sake, and would prove so when the right time came.
  As  for his father and mother, they would have given him up without a  grumble, for they were just as good as the king, and he and they  understood each other perfectly; but in this matter, not seeing that he  could do anything for the king which one of his numerous attendants  could not do as well, Curdie felt that it was for him to decide.
  So  the king took a kind farewell of them all and rode away, with his  daughter on his horse before him.
    A gloom fell upon the mountain and the miners when she was gone, and  Curdie did not whistle for a whole week.
  As for his verses, there was  no occasion to make any now.
  He had made them only to drive away the  goblins, and they were all gone--a good riddance--only the princess was  gone too!  He would rather have had things as they were, except for the  princess's sake.
  But whoever is diligent will soon be cheerful, and  though the miners missed the household of the castle, they yet managed  to get on without them.
 Peter and his wife, however, were troubled with  the fancy that they had stood in the way of their boy's good fortune.
  It would have been such a fine thing for him and them, too, they  thought, if he had ridden with the good king's train.
  How beautiful he  looked, they said, when he rode the king's own horse through the river  that the goblins had sent out of the hill!  He might soon have been a  captain, they did believe!  The good, kind people did not reflect that  the road to the next duty is the only straight one, or that, for their  fancied good, we should never wish our children or friends to do what  we would not do ourselves if we were in their position.
  We must accept  righteous sacrifices as well as make them.
            The White Pigeon    When in the winter they had had their supper and sat about the fire, or  when in the summer they lay on the border of the rock-margined stream  that ran through their little meadow close by the door of their  cottage, issuing from the far-up whiteness often folded in clouds,  Curdie's mother would not seldom lead the conversation to one peculiar  personage said and believed to have been much concerned in the late  issue of events.
    That personage was the great-great-grandmother of the princess, of whom  the princess had often talked, but whom neither Curdie nor his mother  had ever seen.
  Curdie could indeed remember, although already it  looked more like a dream than he could account for if it had really  taken place, how the princess had once led him up many stairs to what  she called a beautiful room in the top of the tower, where she went  through all the--what should he call it?--the behaviour of presenting  him to her grandmother, talking now to her and now to him, while all  the time he saw nothing but a bare garret, a heap of musty straw, a  sunbeam, and a withered apple.
 Lady, he would have declared before the  king himself, young or old, there was none, except the princess  herself, who was certainly vexed that he could not see what she at  least believed she saw.
    As for his mother, she had once seen, long before Curdie was born, a  certain mysterious light of the same description as one Irene spoke of,  calling it her grandmother's moon; and Curdie himself had seen this  same light, shining from above the castle, just as the king and  princess were taking their leave.
  Since that time neither had seen or  heard anything that could be supposed connected with her.
  Strangely  enough, however, nobody had seen her go away.
  If she was such an old  lady, she could hardly be supposed to have set out alone and on foot  when all the house was asleep.
  Still, away she must have gone, for, of  course, if she was so powerful, she would always be about the princess  to take care of her.
    But as Curdie grew older, he doubted more and more whether Irene had  not been talking of some dream she had taken for reality: he had heard  it said that children could not always distinguish betwixt dreams and  actual events.
  At the same time there was his mother's testimony: what  was he to do with that?  His mother, through whom he had learned  everything, could hardly be imagined by her own dutiful son to have  mistaken a dream for a fact of the waking world.
    So he rather shrank from thinking about it, and the less he thought  about it, the less he was inclined to believe it when he did think  about it, and therefore, of course, the less inclined to talk about it  to his father and mother; for although his father was one of those men  who for one word they say think twenty thoughts, Curdie was well  assured that he would rather doubt his own eyes than his wife's  testimony.
    There were no others to whom he could have talked about it.
  The miners  were a mingled company--some good, some not so good, some rather  bad--none of them so bad or so good as they might have been; Curdie  liked most of them, and was a favourite with all; but they knew very  little about the upper world, and what might or might not take place  there.
  They knew silver from copper ore; they understood the  underground ways of things, and they could look very wise with their  lanterns in their hands searching after this or that sign of ore, or  for some mark to guide their way in the hollows of the earth; but as to  great-great-grandmothers, they would have mocked Curdie all the rest of  his life for the absurdity of not being absolutely certain that the  solemn belief of his father and mother was nothing but ridiculous  nonsense.
  Why, to them the very word 'great-great-grandmother' would  have been a week's laughter!  I am not sure that they were able quite  to believe there were such persons as great-great-grandmothers; they  had never seen one.
  They were not companions to give the best of help  toward progress, and as Curdie grew, he grew at this time faster in  body than in mind--with the usual consequence, that he was getting  rather stupid--one of the chief signs of which was that he believed  less and less in things he had never seen.
  At the same time I do not  think he was ever so stupid as to imagine that this was a sign of  superior faculty and strength of mind.
  Still, he was becoming more and  more a miner, and less and less a man of the upper world where the wind  blew.
  On his way to and from the mine he took less and less notice of  bees and butterflies, moths and dragonflies, the flowers and the brooks  and the clouds.
  He was gradually changing into a commonplace man.
    There is this difference between the growth of some human beings and  that of others: in the one case it is a continuous dying, in the other  a continuous resurrection.
  One of the latter sort comes at length to  know at once whether a thing is true the moment it comes before him;  one of the former class grows more and more afraid of being taken in,  so afraid of it that he takes himself in altogether, and comes at  length to believe in nothing but his dinner: to be sure of a thing with  him is to have it between his teeth.
    Curdie was not in a very good way, then, at that time.
  His father and  mother had, it is true, no fault to find with him and yet--and  yet--neither of them was ready to sing when the thought of him came up.
  There must be something wrong when a mother catches herself sighing  over the time when her boy was in petticoats, or a father looks sad  when he thinks how he used to carry him on his shoulder.
  The boy  should enclose and keep, as his life, the old child at the heart of  him, and never let it go.
  He must still, to be a right man, be his  mother's darling, and more, his father's pride, and more.
  The child is  not meant to die, but to be forever fresh born.
    Curdie had made himself a bow and some arrows, and was teaching himself  to shoot with them.
  One evening in the early summer, as he was walking  home from the mine with them in his hand, a light flashed across his  eyes.
  He looked, and there was a snow-white pigeon settling on a rock  in front of him, in the red light of the level sun.
  There it fell at  once to work with one of its wings, in which a feather or two had got  some sprays twisted, causing a certain roughness unpleasant to the  fastidious creature of the air.
    It was indeed a lovely being, and Curdie thought how happy it must be  flitting through the air with a flash--a live bolt of light.
 For a  moment he became so one with the bird that he seemed to feel both its  bill and its feathers, as the one adjusted the other to fly again, and  his heart swelled with the pleasure of its involuntary sympathy.
  Another moment and it would have been aloft in the waves of rosy  light--it was just bending its little legs to spring: that moment it  fell on the path broken-winged and bleeding from Curdie's cruel arrow.
    With a gush of pride at his skill, and pleasure at his success, he ran  to pick up his prey.
  I must say for him he picked it up  gently--perhaps it was the beginning of his repentance.
  But when he  had the white thing in his hands its whiteness stained with another red  than that of the sunset flood in which it had been revelling--ah God!  who knows the joy of a bird, the ecstasy of a creature that has neither  storehouse nor barn!--when he held it, I say, in his victorious hands,  the winged thing looked up in his face--and with such eyes!--asking  what was the matter, and where the red sun had gone, and the clouds,  and the wind of its flight.
  Then they closed, but to open again  presently, with the same questions in them.
    And as they closed and opened, their look was fixed on his.
  It did not  once flutter or try to get away; it only throbbed and bled and looked  at him.
  Curdie's heart began to grow very large in his bosom.
  What  could it mean?  It was nothing but a pigeon, and why should he not kill  a pigeon?  But the fact was that not till this very moment had he ever  known what a pigeon was.
  A good many discoveries of a similar kind  have to be made by most of us.
  Once more it opened its eyes--then  closed them again, and its throbbing ceased.
  Curdie gave a sob: its  last look reminded him of the princess--he did not know why.
  He  remembered how hard he had laboured to set her beyond danger, and yet  what dangers she had had to encounter for his sake: they had been  saviours to each other--and what had he done now?  He had stopped  saving, and had begun killing!  What had he been sent into the world  for?  Surely not to be a death to its joy and loveliness.
  He had done  the thing that was contrary to gladness; he was a destroyer!  He was  not the Curdie he had been meant to be!    Then the underground waters gushed from the boy's heart.
  And with the  tears came the remembrance that a white pigeon, just before the  princess went away with her father, came from somewhere--yes, from the  grandmother's lamp, and flew round the king and Irene and himself, and  then flew away: this might be that very pigeon! Horrible to think!  And  if it wasn't, yet it was a white pigeon, the same as this.
  And if she  kept a great Many pigeons--and white ones, as Irene had told him, then  whose pigeon could he have killed but the grand old princess's?    Suddenly everything round about him seemed against him.
  The red sunset  stung him; the rocks frowned at him; the sweet wind that had been  laving his face as he walked up the hill dropped--as if he wasn't fit  to be kissed any more.
  Was the whole world going to cast him out?  Would he have to stand there forever, not knowing what to do, with the  dead pigeon in his hand?  Things looked bad indeed.
  Was the whole  world going to make a work about a pigeon--a white pigeon?  The sun  went down.
  Great clouds gathered over the west, and shortened the  twilight.
  The wind gave a howl, and then lay down again.
  The clouds  gathered thicker.
  Then came a rumbling.
  He thought it was thunder.
  It was a rock that fell inside the mountain.
  A goat ran past him down  the hill, followed by a dog sent to fetch him home.
  He thought they  were goblin creatures, and trembled.
  He used to despise them.
  And  still he held the dead pigeon tenderly in his hand.
    It grew darker and darker.
  An evil something began to move in his  heart.
  'What a fool I am!' he said to himself.
  Then he grew angry,  and was just going to throw the bird from him and whistle, when a  brightness shone all round him.
  He lifted his eyes, and saw a great  globe of light--like silver at the hottest heat: he had once seen  silver run from the furnace.
  It shone from somewhere above the roofs  of the castle: it must be the great old princess's moon!  How could she  be there?  Of course she was not there!  He had asked the whole  household, and nobody knew anything about her or her globe either.
  It  couldn't be!  And yet what did that signify, when there was the white  globe shining, and here was the dead white bird in his hand?  That  moment the pigeon gave a little flutter.
  'It's not dead!' cried  Curdie, almost with a shriek.
  The same instant he was running full  speed toward the castle, never letting his heels down, lest he should  shake the poor, wounded bird.
            The Mistress of the Silver Moon    When Curdie reached the castle, and ran into the little garden in front  of it, there stood the door wide open.
  This was as he had hoped, for  what could he have said if he had had to knock at it? Those whose  business it is to open doors, so often mistake and shut them!  But the  woman now in charge often puzzled herself greatly to account for the  strange fact that however often she shut the door, which, like the  rest, she took a great deal of unnecessary trouble to do, she was  certain, the next time she went to it, to find it open.
  I speak now of  the great front door, of course: the back door she as persistently kept  wide: if people could only go in by that, she said, she would then know  what sort they were, and what they wanted.
  But she would neither have  known what sort Curdie was, nor what he wanted, and would assuredly  have denied him admittance, for she knew nothing of who was in the  tower.
  So the front door was left open for him, and in he walked.
    But where to go next he could not tell.
  It was not quite dark: a dull,  shineless twilight filled the place.
  All he knew was that he must go  up, and that proved enough for the present, for there he saw the great  staircase rising before him.
  When he reached the top of it, he knew  there must be more stairs yet, for he could not be near the top of the  tower.
  Indeed by the situation of the stairs, he must be a good way  from the tower itself.
  But those who work well in the depths more  easily understand the heights, for indeed in their true nature they are  one and the same; miners are in mountains; and Curdie, from knowing the  ways of the king's mines, and being able to calculate his whereabouts  in them, was now able to find his way about the king's house.
  He knew  its outside perfectly, and now his business was to get his notion of  the inside right with the outside.
    So he shut his eyes and made a picture of the outside of it in his  mind.
  Then he came in at the door of the picture, and yet kept the  picture before him all the time--for you can do that kind of thing in  your mind--and took every turn of the stair over again, always watching  to remember, every time he turned his face, how the tower lay, and then  when he came to himself at the top where he stood, he knew exactly  where it was, and walked at once in the right direction.
    On his way, however, he came to another stair, and up that he went, of  course, watching still at every turn how the tower must lie.
  At the  top of this stair was yet another--they were the stairs up which the  princess ran when first, without knowing it, she was on her way to find  her great-great-grandmother.
  At the top of the second stair he could  go no farther, and must therefore set out again to find the tower,  which, as it rose far above the rest of the house, must have the last  of its stairs inside itself.
    Having watched every turn to the very last, he still knew quite well in  what direction he must go to find it, so he left the stair and went  down a passage that led, if not exactly toward it, yet nearer it.
  This  passage was rather dark, for it was very long, with only one window at  the end, and although there were doors on both sides of it, they were  all shut.
  At the distant window glimmered the chill east, with a few  feeble stars in it, and its like was dreary and old, growing brown, and  looking as if it were thinking about the day that was just gone.
  Presently he turned into another passage, which also had a window at  the end of it; and in at that window shone all that was left of the  sunset, just a few ashes, with here and there a little touch of warmth:  it was nearly as sad as the east, only there was one difference--it was  very plainly thinking of tomorrow.
    But at present Curdie had nothing to do with today or tomorrow; his  business was with the bird, and the tower where dwelt the grand old  princess to whom it belonged.
  So he kept on his way, still eastward,  and came to yet another passage, which brought him to a door.
  He was  afraid to open it without first knocking.
  He knocked, but heard no  answer.
  He was answered nevertheless; for the door gently opened, and  there was a narrow stair--and so steep that, big lad as he was, he,  too, like the Princess Irene before him, found his hands needful for  the climbing.
  And it was a long climb, but he reached the top at  last--a little landing, with a door in front and one on each side.
  Which should he knock at?    As he hesitated, he heard the noise of a spinning wheel.
  He knew it at  once, because his mother's spinning wheel had been his governess long  ago, and still taught him things.
  It was the spinning wheel that first  taught him to make verses, and to sing, and to think whether all was  right inside him; or at least it had helped him in all these things.
  Hence it was no wonder he should know a spinning wheel when he heard it  sing--even although as the bird of paradise to other birds was the song  of that wheel to the song of his mother's.
    He stood listening, so entranced that he forgot to knock, and the wheel  went on and on, spinning in his brain songs and tales and rhymes, till  he was almost asleep as well as dreaming, for sleep does not always  come first.
  But suddenly came the thought of the poor bird, which had  been lying motionless in his hand all the time, and that woke him up,  and at once he knocked.
    'Come in, Curdie,' said a voice.
    Curdie shook.
  It was getting rather awful.
  The heart that had never  much heeded an army of goblins trembled at the soft word of invitation.
  But then there was the red-spotted white thing in his hand!  He dared  not hesitate, though.
  Gently he opened the door through which the  sound came, and what did he see?  Nothing at first--except indeed a  great sloping shaft of moonlight that came in at a high window, and  rested on the floor.
  He stood and stared at it, forgetting to shut the  door.
    'Why don't you come in, Curdie?' said the voice.
  'Did you never see  moonlight before?'    'Never without a moon,' answered Curdie, in a trembling tone, but  gathering courage.
    'Certainly not,' returned the voice, which was thin and quavering: 'I  never saw moonlight without a moon.
'    'But there's no moon outside,' said Curdie.
    'Ah! but you're inside now,' said the voice.
    The answer did not satisfy Curdie; but the voice went on.
    'There are more moons than you know of, Curdie.
  Where there is one sun  there are many moons--and of many sorts.
  Come in and look out of my  window, and you will soon satisfy yourself that there is a moon looking  in at it.
'    The gentleness of the voice made Curdie remember his manners.
  He shut  the door, and drew a step or two nearer to the moonlight.
    All the time the sound of the spinning had been going on and on, and  Curdie now caught sight of the wheel.
  Oh, it was such a thin, delicate  thing--reminding him of a spider's web in a hedge.
  It stood in the  middle of the moonlight, and it seemed as if the moonlight had nearly  melted it away.
  A step nearer, he saw, with a start, two little hands  at work with it.
  And then at last, in the shadow on the other side of  the moonlight which came like silver between, he saw the form to which  the hands belonged: a small withered creature, so old that no age would  have seemed too great to write under her picture, seated on a stool  beyond the spinning wheel, which looked very large beside her, but, as  I said, very thin, like a long-legged spider holding up its own web,  which was the round wheel itself She sat crumpled together, a filmy  thing that it seemed a puff would blow away, more like the body of a  fly the big spider had sucked empty and left hanging in his web, than  anything else I can think of.
    When Curdie saw her, he stood still again, a good deal in wonder, a  very little in reverence, a little in doubt, and, I must add, a little  in amusement at the odd look of the old marvel.
  Her grey hair mixed  with the moonlight so that he could not tell where the one began and  the other ended.
  Her crooked back bent forward over her chest, her  shoulders nearly swallowed up her head between them, and her two little  hands were just like the grey claws of a hen, scratching at the thread,  which to Curdie was of course invisible across the moonlight.
  Indeed  Curdie laughed within himself, just a little, at the sight; and when he  thought of how the princess used to talk about her huge, great, old  grandmother, he laughed more.
  But that moment the little lady leaned  forward into the moonlight, and Curdie caught a glimpse of her eyes,  and all the laugh went out of him.
    'What do you come here for, Curdie?' she said, as gently as before.
    Then Curdie remembered that he stood there as a culprit, and worst of  all, as one who had his confession yet to make.
  There was no time to  hesitate over it.
    'Oh, ma'am!  See here,' he said, and advanced a step or two, holding  out the pigeon.
    'What have you got there?' she asked.
    Again Curdie advanced a few steps, and held out his hand with the  pigeon, that she might see what it was, into the moonlight.
  The moment  the rays fell upon it the pigeon gave a faint flutter.
  The old lady  put out her old hands and took it, and held it to her bosom, and rocked  it, murmuring over it as if it were a sick baby.
    When Curdie saw how distressed she was he grew sorrier still, and said:    'I didn't mean to do any harm, ma'am.
  I didn't think of its being  yours.
'    'Ah, Curdie!  If it weren't mine, what would become of it now?' she  returned.
  'You say you didn't mean any harm: did you mean any good,  Curdie?'    'No,' answered Curdie.
    'Remember, then, that whoever does not mean good is always in danger of  harm.
  But I try to give everybody fair play; and those that are in the  wrong are in far more need of it always than those who are in the  right: they can afford to do without it.
  Therefore I say for you that  when you shot that arrow you did not know what a pigeon is.
  Now that  you do know, you are sorry.
  It is very dangerous to do things you  don't know about.
'    'But, please, ma'am--I don't mean to be rude or to contradict you,'  said Curdie, 'but if a body was never to do anything but what he knew  to be good, he would have to live half his time doing nothing.
'    'There you are much mistaken,' said the old quavering voice.
  'How  little you must have thought!  Why, you don't seem even to know the  good of the things you are constantly doing.
  Now don't mistake me.
 I  don't mean you are good for doing them.
  It is a good thing to eat your  breakfast, but you don't fancy it's very good of you to do it.
  The  thing is good, not you.
'    Curdie laughed.
    'There are a great many more good things than bad things to do.
 Now  tell me what bad thing you have done today besides this sore hurt to my  little white friend.
'    While she talked Curdie had sunk into a sort of reverie, in which he  hardly knew whether it was the old lady or his own heart that spoke.
  And when she asked him that question, he was at first much inclined to  consider himself a very good fellow on the whole.
  'I really don't  think I did anything else that was very bad all day,' he said to  himself.
  But at the same time he could not honestly feel that he was  worth standing up for.
  All at once a light seemed to break in upon his  mind, and he woke up and there was the withered little atomy of the old  lady on the other side of the moonlight, and there was the spinning  wheel singing on and on in the middle of it!    'I know now, ma'am; I understand now,' he said.
  'Thank you, ma'am, for  spinning it into me with your wheel.
  I see now that I have been doing  wrong the whole day, and such a many days besides! Indeed, I don't know  when I ever did right, and yet it seems as if I had done right some  time and had forgotten how.
  When I killed your bird I did not know I  was doing wrong, just because I was always doing wrong, and the wrong  had soaked all through me.
'    'What wrong were you doing all day, Curdie?  It is better to come to  the point, you know,' said the old lady, and her voice was gentler even  than before.
    'I was doing the wrong of never wanting or trying to be better.
 And now  I see that I have been letting things go as they would for a long time.
  Whatever came into my head I did, and whatever didn't come into my head  I didn't do.
  I never sent anything away, and never looked out for  anything to come.
  I haven't been attending to my mother--or my father  either.
  And now I think of it, I know I have often seen them looking  troubled, and I have never asked them what was the matter.
  And now I  see, too, that I did not ask because I suspected it had something to do  with me and my behaviour, and didn't want to hear the truth.
  And I  know I have been grumbling at my work, and doing a hundred other things  that are wrong.
'    'You have got it, Curdie,' said the old lady, in a voice that sounded  almost as if she had been crying.
  'When people don't care to be better  they must be doing everything wrong.
  I am so glad you shot my bird!'    'Ma'am!' exclaimed Curdie.
  'How can you be?'    'Because it has brought you to see what sort you were when you did it,  and what sort you will grow to be again, only worse, if you don't mind.
  Now that you are sorry, my poor bird will be better.
 Look up, my dovey.
'    The pigeon gave a flutter, and spread out one of its red-spotted wings  across the old woman's bosom.
    'I will mend the little angel,' she said, 'and in a week or two it will  be flying again.
  So you may ease your heart about the pigeon.
'    'Oh, thank you!  Thank you!' cried Curdie.
  'I don't know how to thank  you.
'    'Then I will tell you.
  There is only one way I care for.
  Do better,  and grow better, and be better.
  And never kill anything without a good  reason for it.
'    'Ma'am, I will go and fetch my bow and arrows, and you shall burn them  yourself.
'    'I have no fire that would burn your bow and arrows, Curdie.
'    'Then I promise you to burn them all under my mother's porridge pot  tomorrow morning.
'    'No, no, Curdie.
  Keep them, and practice with them every day, and grow  a good shot.
  There are plenty of bad things that want killing, and a  day will come when they will prove useful.
  But I must see first  whether you will do as I tell you.
'    'That I will!' said Curdie.
  'What is it, ma'am?'    'Only something not to do,' answered the old lady; 'if you should hear  anyone speak about me, never to laugh or make fun of me.
'    'Oh, ma'am!' exclaimed Curdie, shocked that she should think such a  request needful.
    'Stop, stop,' she went on.
  'People hereabout sometimes tell very odd  and in fact ridiculous stories of an old woman who watches what is  going on, and occasionally interferes.
  They mean me, though what they  say is often great nonsense.
  Now what I want of you is not to laugh,  or side with them in any way; because they will take that to mean that  you don't believe there is any such person a bit more than they do.
  Now that would not be the case--would it, Curdie?'    'No, indeed, ma'am.
  I've seen you.
'    The old woman smiled very oddly.
    'Yes, you've seen me,' she said.
  'But mind,' she continued, 'I don't  want you to say anything--only to hold your tongue, and not seem to  side with them.
'    'That will be easy,'said Curdie,'now that I've seen you with my very  own eyes, ma'am.
'    'Not so easy as you think, perhaps,' said the old lady, with another  curious smile.
  'I want to be your friend,' she added after a little  pause, 'but I don't quite know yet whether you will let me.
'    'Indeed I will, ma'am,' said Curdie.
    'That is for me to find out,' she rejoined, with yet another strange  smile.
  'In the meantime all I can say is, come to me again when you  find yourself in any trouble, and I will see what I can do for  you--only the canning depends on yourself.
  I am greatly pleased with  you for bringing me my pigeon, doing your best to set right what you  had set wrong.
'    As she spoke she held out her hand to him, and when he took it she made  use of his to help herself up from her stool, and--when or how it came  about, Curdie could not tell--the same instant she stood before him a  tall, strong woman--plainly very old, but as grand as she was old, and  only rather severe-looking.
  Every trace of the decrepitude and  witheredness she showed as she hovered like a film about her wheel, had  vanished.
  Her hair was very white, but it hung about her head in great  plenty, and shone like silver in the moonlight.
  Straight as a pillar  she stood before the astonished boy, and the wounded bird had now  spread out both its wings across her bosom, like some great mystical  ornament of frosted silver.
    'Oh, now I can never forget you!' cried Curdie.
  'I see now what you  really are!'    'Did I not tell you the truth when I sat at my wheel?' said the old  lady.
    'Yes, ma'am,' answered Curdie.
    'I can do no more than tell you the truth now,' she rejoined.
  'It is a  bad thing indeed to forget one who has told us the truth.
  Now go.
'    Curdie obeyed, and took a few steps toward the door.
  'Please,  ma'am--what am I to call you?' he was going to say; but when he turned  to speak, he saw nobody.
  Whether she was there or not he could not  tell, however, for the moonlight had vanished, and the room was utterly  dark.
  A great fear, such as he had never before known, came upon him,  and almost overwhelmed him.
  He groped his way to the door, and crawled  down the stair--in doubt and anxiety as to how he should find his way  out of the house in the dark.
  And the stair seemed ever so much longer  than when he came up.
  Nor was that any wonder, for down and down he  went, until at length his foot struck a door, and when he rose and  opened it, he found himself under the starry, moonless sky at the foot  of the tower.
    He soon discovered the way out of the garden, with which he had some  acquaintance already, and in a few minutes was climbing the mountain  with a solemn and cheerful heart.
  It was rather dark, but he knew the  way well.
  As he passed the rock from which the poor pigeon fell  wounded with his arrow, a great joy filled his heart at the thought  that he was delivered from the blood of the little bird, and he ran the  next hundred yards at full speed up the hill.
 Some dark shadows passed  him: he did not even care to think what they were, but let them run.
  When he reached home, he found his father and mother waiting supper for  him.
            Curdie's Father and Mother    The eyes of the fathers and mothers are quick to read their children's  looks, and when Curdie entered the cottage, his parents saw at once  that something unusual had taken place.
  When he said to his mother, 'I  beg your pardon for being so late,' there was something in the tone  beyond the politeness that went to her heart, for it seemed to come  from the place where all lovely things were born before they began to  grow in this world.
  When he set his father's chair to the table, an  attention he had not shown him for a long time, Peter thanked him with  more gratitude than the boy had ever yet felt in all his life.
  It was  a small thing to do for the man who had been serving him since ever he  was born, but I suspect there is nothing a man can be so grateful for  as that to which he has the most right.
    There was a change upon Curdie, and father and mother felt there must  be something to account for it, and therefore were pretty sure he had  something to tell them.
  For when a child's heart is all right, it is  not likely he will want to keep anything from his parents.
  But the  story of the evening was too solemn for Curdie to come out with all at  once.
  He must wait until they had had their porridge, and the affairs  of this world were over for the day.
    But when they were seated on the grassy bank of the brook that went so  sweetly blundering over the great stones of its rocky channel, for the  whole meadow lay on the top of a huge rock, then he felt that the right  hour had come for sharing with them the wonderful things that had come  to him.
  It was perhaps the loveliest of all hours in the year.
  The  summer was young and soft, and this was the warmest evening they had  yet had--dusky, dark even below, while above, the stars were bright and  large and sharp in the blackest blue sky.
  The night came close around  them, clasping them in one universal arm of love, and although it  neither spoke nor smiled, seemed all eye and ear, seemed to see and  hear and know everything they said and did.
  It is a way the night has  sometimes, and there is a reason for it.
  The only sound was that of  the brook, for there was no wind, and no trees for it to make its music  upon if there had been, for the cottage was high up on the mountain, on  a great shoulder of stone where trees would not grow.
    There, to the accompaniment of the water, as it hurried down to the  valley and the sea, talking busily of a thousand true things which it  could not understand, Curdie told his tale, outside and in, to his  father and mother.
  What a world had slipped in between the mouth of  the mine and his mother's cottage!  Neither of them said a word until  he had ended.
    'Now what am I to make of it, Mother? it's so strange!' he said, and  stopped.
    'It's easy enough to see what Curdie has got to make of it, isn't it,  Peter?' said the good woman, turning her face toward all she could see  of her husband's.
    'It seems so to me,' answered Peter, with a smile which only the night  saw, but his wife felt in the tone of his words.
  They were the  happiest couple in that country, because they always understood each  other, and that was because they always meant the same thing, and that  was because they always loved what was fair and true and right better,  not than anything else, but than everything else put together.
    'Then will you tell Curdie?' said she.
    'You can talk best, Joan,' said he.
  'You tell him, and I will  listen--and learn how to say what I think,' he added.
    'I,' said Curdie, 'don't know what to think.
'    'It does not matter so much,' said his mother.
  'If only you know what  to make of a thing, you'll know soon enough what to think of it.
  Now I  needn't tell you, surely, Curdie, what you've got to do with this?'    'I suppose you mean, Mother,' answered Curdie, 'that I must do as the  old lady told me?'    'That is what I mean: what else could it be?  Am I not right, Peter?'    'Quite right, Joan,' answered Peter, 'so far as my judgement goes.
 It  is a very strange story, but you see the question is not about  believing it, for Curdie knows what came to him.
'    'And you remember, Curdie,' said his mother, 'that when the princess  took you up that tower once before, and there talked to her  great-great-grandmother, you came home quite angry with her, and said  there was nothing in the place but an old tub, a heap of straw--oh, I  remember your inventory quite well!--an old tub, a heap of straw, a  withered apple, and a sunbeam.
  According to your eyes, that was all  there was in the great, old, musty garret.
  But now you have had a  glimpse of the old princess herself!'    'Yes, Mother, I did see her--or if I didn't--' said Curdie very  thoughtfully--then began again.
  'The hardest thing to believe, though  I saw it with my own eyes, was when the thin, filmy creature that  seemed almost to float about in the moonlight like a bit of the silver  paper they put over pictures, or like a handkerchief made of spider  threads, took my hand, and rose up.
  She was taller and stronger than  you, Mother, ever so much!--at least, she looked so.
'    'And most certainly was so, Curdie, if she looked so,' said Mrs  Peterson.
    'Well, I confess,' returned her son, 'that one thing, if there were no  other, would make me doubt whether I was not dreaming, after all, wide  awake though I fancied myself to be.
'    'Of course,' answered his mother, 'it is not for me to say whether you  were dreaming or not if you are doubtful of it yourself; but it doesn't  make me think I am dreaming when in the summer I hold in my hand the  bunch of sweet peas that make my heart glad with their colour and  scent, and remember the dry, withered-looking little thing I dibbled  into the hole in the same spot in the spring.
  I only think how  wonderful and lovely it all is.
  It seems just as full of reason as it  is of wonder.
  How it is done I can't tell, only there it is!  And  there is this in it, too, Curdie--of which you would not be so ready to  think--that when you come home to your father and mother, and they find  you behaving more like a dear, good son than you have behaved for a  long time, they at least are not likely to think you were only  dreaming.
'    'Still,' said Curdie, looking a little ashamed, 'I might have dreamed  my duty.
'    'Then dream often, my son; for there must then be more truth in your  dreams than in your waking thoughts.
  But however any of these things  may be, this one point remains certain: there can be no harm in doing  as she told you.
  And, indeed, until you are sure there is no such  person, you are bound to do it, for you promised.
'    'It seems to me,' said his father, 'that if a lady comes to you in a  dream, Curdie, and tells you not to talk about her when you wake, the  least you can do is to hold your tongue.
'    'True, Father!  Yes, Mother, I'll do it,' said Curdie.
    Then they went to bed, and sleep, which is the night of the soul, next  took them in its arms and made them well.
            The Miners    It much increased Curdie's feeling of the strangeness of the whole  affair, that, the next morning, when they were at work in the mine, the  party of which he and his father were two, just as if they had known  what had happened to him the night before, began talking about all  manner of wonderful tales that were abroad in the country, chiefly, of  course, those connected with the mines, and the mountains in which they  lay.
  Their wives and mothers and grandmothers were their chief  authorities.
  For when they sat by their firesides they heard their  wives telling their children the selfsame tales, with little  differences, and here and there one they had not heard before, which  they had heard their mothers and grandmothers tell in one or other of  the same cottages.
    At length they came to speak of a certain strange being they called Old  Mother Wotherwop.
  Some said their wives had seen her.
  It appeared as  they talked that not one had seen her more than once.
 Some of their  mothers and grandmothers, however, had seen her also, and they all had  told them tales about her when they were children.
 They said she could  take any shape she liked, but that in reality she was a withered old  woman, so old and so withered that she was as thin as a sieve with a  lamp behind it; that she was never seen except at night, and when  something terrible had taken place, or was going to take place--such as  the falling in of the roof of a mine, or the breaking out of water in  it.
    She had more than once been seen--it was always at night--beside some  well, sitting on the brink of it, and leaning over and stirring it with  her forefinger, which was six times as long as any of the rest.
  And  whoever for months after drank of that well was sure to be ill.
  To  this, one of them, however, added that he remembered his mother saying  that whoever in bad health drank of the well was sure to get better.
  But the majority agreed that the former was the right version of the  story--for was she not a witch, an old hating witch, whose delight was  to do mischief?  One said he had heard that she took the shape of a  young woman sometimes, as beautiful as an angel, and then was most  dangerous of all, for she struck every man who looked upon her  stone-blind.
    Peter ventured the question whether she might not as likely be an angel  that took the form of an old woman, as an old woman that took the form  of an angel.
  But nobody except Curdie, who was holding his peace with  all his might, saw any sense in the question.
  They said an old woman  might be very glad to make herself look like a young one, but who ever  heard of a young and beautiful one making herself look old and ugly?    Peter asked why they were so much more ready to believe the bad that  was said of her than the good.
  They answered, because she was bad.
  He  asked why they believed her to be bad, and they answered, because she  did bad things.
  When he asked how they knew that, they said, because  she was a bad creature.
  Even if they didn't know it, they said, a  woman like that was so much more likely to be bad than good.
  Why did  she go about at night?  Why did she appear only now and then, and on  such occasions?  One went on to tell how one night when his grandfather  had been having a jolly time of it with his friends in the market town,  she had served him so upon his way home that the poor man never drank a  drop of anything stronger than water after it to the day of his death.
  She dragged him into a bog, and tumbled him up and down in it till he  was nearly dead.
    'I suppose that was her way of teaching him what a good thing water  was,' said Peter; but the man, who liked strong drink, did not see the  joke.
    'They do say,' said another, 'that she has lived in the old house over  there ever since the little princess left it.
  They say too that the  housekeeper knows all about it, and is hand and glove with the old  witch.
  I don't doubt they have many a nice airing together on  broomsticks.
  But I don't doubt either it's all nonsense, and there's  no such person at all.
'    'When our cow died,' said another, 'she was seen going round and round  the cowhouse the same night.
  To be sure she left a fine calf behind  her--I mean the cow did, not the witch.
  I wonder she didn't kill that,  too, for she'll be a far finer cow than ever her mother was.
'    'My old woman came upon her one night, not long before the water broke  out in the mine, sitting on a stone on the hillside with a whole  congregation of cobs about her.
  When they saw my wife they all  scampered off as fast as they could run, and where the witch was  sitting there was nothing to be seen but a withered bracken bush.
  I  made no doubt myself she was putting them up to it.
'    And so they went on with one foolish tale after another, while Peter  put in a word now and then, and Curdie diligently held his peace.
  But  his silence at last drew attention upon it, and one of them said:    'Come, young Curdie, what are you thinking of?'    'How do you know I'm thinking of anything?' asked Curdie.
    'Because you're not saying anything.
'    'Does it follow then that, as you are saying so much, you're not  thinking at all?' said Curdie.
    'I know what he's thinking,' said one who had not yet spoken; 'he's  thinking what a set of fools you are to talk such rubbish; as if ever  there was or could be such an old woman as you say!  I'm sure Curdie  knows better than all that comes to.
'    'I think,' said Curdie, 'it would be better that he who says anything  about her should be quite sure it is true, lest she should hear him,  and not like to be slandered.
'    'But would she like it any better if it were true?' said the same man.
  'If she is What they say--I don't know--but I never knew a man that  wouldn't go in a rage to be called the very thing he was.
'    'If bad things were true of her, and I knew it,' said Curdie, 'I would  not hesitate to say them, for I will never give in to being afraid of  anything that's bad.
  I suspect that the things they tell, however, if  we knew all about them, would turn out to have nothing but good in  them; and I won't say a word more for fear I should say something that  mightn't be to her mind.
'    They all burst into a loud laugh.
    'Hear the parson!' they cried.
  'He believes in the witch!  Ha! ha!'    'He's afraid of her!'    'And says all she does is good!'    'He wants to make friends with her, that she may help him to find the  silver ore.
'    'Give me my own eyes and a good divining rod before all the witches in  the world!  And so I'd advise you too, Master Curdie; that is, when  your eyes have grown to be worth anything, and you have learned to cut  the hazel fork.
'    Thus they all mocked and jeered at him, but he did his best to keep his  temper and go quietly on with his work.
  He got as close to his father  as he could, however, for that helped him to bear it.
  As soon as they  were tired of laughing and mocking, Curdie was friendly with them, and  long before their midday meal all between them was as it had been.
    But when the evening came, Peter and Curdie felt that they would rather  walk home together without other company, and therefore lingered behind  when the rest of the men left the mine.
            The Emerald    Father and son had seated themselves on a projecting piece of rock at a  corner where three galleries met--the one they had come along from  their work, one to the right leading out of the mountain, and the other  to the left leading far into a portion of it which had been long  disused.
  Since the inundation caused by the goblins, it had indeed  been rendered impassable by the settlement of a quantity of the water,  forming a small but very deep lake, in a part where there was a  considerable descent.
    They had just risen and were turning to the right, when a gleam caught  their eyes, and made them look along the whole gallery.
  Far up they  saw a pale green light, whence issuing they could not tell, about  halfway between floor and roof of the passage.
  They saw nothing but  the light, which was like a large star, with a point of darker colour  yet brighter radiance in the heart of it, whence the rest of the light  shot out in rays that faded toward the ends until they vanished.
  It  shed hardly any light around it, although in itself it was so bright as  to sting the eyes that beheld it.
 Wonderful stories had from ages gone  been current in the mines about certain magic gems which gave out light  of themselves, and this light looked just like what might be supposed  to shoot from the heart of such a gem.
    They went up the old gallery to find out what it could be.
  To their  surprise they found, however, that, after going some distance, they  were no nearer to it, so far as they could judge, than when they  started.
  It did not seem to move, and yet they moving did not approach  it.
  Still they persevered, for it was far too wonderful a thing to  lose sight of, so long as they could keep it.
  At length they drew near  the hollow where the water lay, and still were no nearer the light.
  Where they expected to be stopped by the water, however, water was  none: something had taken place in some part of the mine that had  drained it off, and the gallery lay open as in former times.
    And now, to their surprise, the light, instead of being in front of  them, was shining at the same distance to the right, where they did not  know there was any passage at all.
  Then they discovered, by the light  of the lanterns they carried, that there the water had broken through,  and made an entrance to a part of the mountain of which Peter knew  nothing.
  But they were hardly well into it, still following the light,  before Curdie thought he recognized some of the passages he had so  often gone through when he was watching the goblins.
    After they had advanced a long way, with many turnings, now to the  right, now to the left, all at once their eyes seemed to come suddenly  to themselves, and they became aware that the light which they had  taken to be a great way from them was in reality almost within reach of  their hands.
    The same instant it began to grow larger and thinner, the point of  light grew dim as it spread, the greenness melted away, and in a moment  or two, instead of the star, a dark, dark and yet luminous face was  looking at them with living eyes.
  And Curdie felt a great awe swell up  in his heart, for he thought he had seen those eyes before.
    'I see you know me, Curdie,' said a voice.
    'If your eyes are you, ma'am, then I know you,' said Curdie.
  'But I  never saw your face before.
'    'Yes, you have seen it, Curdie,' said the voice.
  And with that the  darkness of its complexion melted away, and down from the face dawned  out the form that belonged to it, until at last Curdie and his father  beheld a lady, beautiful exceedingly, dressed in something pale green,  like velvet, over which her hair fell in cataracts of a rich golden  colour.
  It looked as if it were pouring down from her head, and, like  the water of the Dustbrook, vanishing in a golden vapour ere it reached  the floor.
  It came flowing from under the edge of a coronet of gold,  set with alternated pearls and emeralds.
  In front of the crown was a  great emerald, which looked somehow as if out of it had come the light  they had followed.
 There was no ornament else about her, except on her  slippers, which were one mass of gleaming emeralds, of various shades  of green, all mingling lovelily like the waving of grass in the wind  and sun.
 She looked about five-and-twenty years old.
  And for all the  difference, Curdie knew somehow or other, he could not have told how,  that the face before him was that of the old princess, Irene's  great-great-grandmother.
    By this time all around them had grown light, and now first they could  see where they were.
  They stood in a great splendid cavern, which  Curdie recognized as that in which the goblins held their state  assemblies.
  But, strange to tell, the light by which they saw came  streaming, sparkling, and shooting from stones of many colours in the  sides and roof and floor of the cavern--stones of all the colours of  the rainbow, and many more.
  It was a glorious sight--the whole rugged  place flashing with colours--in one spot a great light of deep  carbuncular red, in another of sapphirine blue, in another of topaz  yellow; while here and there were groups of stones of all hues and  sizes, and again nebulous spaces of thousands of tiniest spots of  brilliancy of every conceivable shade.
  Sometimes the colours ran  together, and made a little river or lake of lambent, interfusing, and  changing tints, which, by their variegation, seemed to imitate the  flowing of water, or waves made by the wind.
    Curdie would have gazed entranced, but that all the beauty of the  cavern, yes, of all he knew of the whole creation, seemed gathered in  one centre of harmony and loveliness in the person of the ancient lady  who stood before him in the very summer of beauty and strength.
  Turning from the first glance at the circuadjacent splendour, it  dwindled into nothing as he looked again at the lady.
 Nothing flashed  or glowed or shone about her, and yet it was with a prevision of the  truth that he said,    'I was here once before, ma'am.
'    'I know that, Curdie,' she replied.
    'The place was full of torches, and the walls gleamed, but nothing as  they do now, and there is no light in the place.
'    'You want to know where the light comes from?' she said, smiling.
    'Yes, ma'am.
'    'Then see: I will go out of the cavern.
  Do not be afraid, but watch.
'    She went slowly out.
  The moment she turned her back to go, the light  began to pale and fade; the moment she was out of their sight the place  was black as night, save that now the smoky yellow-red of their lamps,  which they thought had gone out long ago, cast a dusky glimmer around  them.
            What Is in a Name?    For a time that seemed to them long, the two men stood waiting, while  still the Mother of Light did not return.
  So long was she absent that  they began to grow anxious: how were they to find their way from the  natural hollows of the mountain crossed by goblin paths, if their lamps  should go out?  To spend the night there would mean to sit and wait  until an earthquake rent the mountain, or the earth herself fell back  into the smelting furnace of the sun whence she had issued--for it was  all night and no faintest dawn in the bosom of the world.
    So long did they wait unrevisited, that, had there not been two of  them, either would at length have concluded the vision a home-born  product of his own seething brain.
  And their lamps were going out, for  they grew redder and smokier!  But they did not lose courage, for there  is a kind of capillary attraction in the facing of two souls, that  lifts faith quite beyond the level to which either could raise it  alone: they knew that they had seen the lady of emeralds, and it was to  give them their own desire that she had gone from them, and neither  would yield for a moment to the half doubts and half dreads that awoke  in his heart.
    And still she who with her absence darkened their air did not return.
  They grew weary, and sat down on the rocky floor, for wait they  would--indeed, wait they must.
  Each set his lamp by his knee, and  watched it die.
  Slowly it sank, dulled, looked lazy and stupid.
  But  ever as it sank and dulled, the image in his mind of the Lady of Light  grew stronger and clearer.
  Together the two lamps panted and  shuddered.
  First one, then the other went out, leaving for a moment a  great, red, evil-smelling snuff.
  Then all was the blackness of  darkness up to their very hearts and everywhere around them.
  Was it?  No.
  Far away--it looked miles away--shone one minute faint point of  green light--where, who could tell?  They only knew that it shone.
  It  grew larger, and seemed to draw nearer, until at last, as they watched  with speechless delight and expectation, it seemed once more within  reach of an outstretched hand.
  Then it spread and melted away as  before, and there were eyes--and a face--and a lovely form--and lo! the  whole cavern blazing with lights innumerable, and gorgeous, yet soft  and interfused--so blended, indeed, that the eye had to search and see  in order to separate distinct spots of special colour.
    The moment they saw the speck in the vast distance they had risen and  stood on their feet.
  When it came nearer they bowed their heads.
  Yet  now they looked with fearless eyes, for the woman that was old yet  young was a joy to see, and filled their hearts with reverent delight.
  She turned first to Peter.
    'I have known you long,' she said.
  'I have met you going to and from  the mine, and seen you working in it for the last forty years.
'    'How should it be, madam, that a grand lady like you should take notice  of a poor man like me?' said Peter, humbly, but more foolishly than he  could then have understood.
    'I am poor as well as rich,' said she.
  'I, too, work for my bread, and  I show myself no favour when I pay myself my own wages.
  Last night  when you sat by the brook, and Curdie told you about my pigeon, and my  spinning, and wondered whether he could believe that he had actually  seen me, I heard what you said to each other.
  I am always about, as  the miners said the other night when they talked of me as Old Mother  Wotherwop.
'    The lovely lady laughed, and her laugh was a lightning of delight in  their souls.
    'Yes,' she went on, 'you have got to thank me that you are so poor,  Peter.
  I have seen to that, and it has done well for both you and me,  my friend.
  Things come to the poor that can't get in at the door of  the rich.
  Their money somehow blocks it up.
  It is a great privilege  to be poor, Peter--one that no man ever coveted, and but a very few  have sought to retain, but one that yet many have learned to prize.
  You must not mistake, however, and imagine it a virtue; it is but a  privilege, and one also that, like other privileges, may be terribly  misused.
  Had you been rich, my Peter, you would not have been so good  as some rich men I know.
  And now I am going to tell you what no one  knows but myself: you, Peter, and your wife both have the blood of the  royal family in your veins.
  I have been trying to cultivate your  family tree, every branch of which is known to me, and I expect Curdie  to turn out a blossom on it.
  Therefore I have been training him for a  work that must soon be done.
  I was near losing him, and had to send my  pigeon.
  Had he not shot it, that would have been better; but he  repented, and that shall be as good in the end.
'    She turned to Curdie and smiled.
    'Ma'am,' said Curdie, 'may I ask questions?'    'Why not, Curdie?'    'Because I have been told, ma'am, that nobody must ask the king  questions.
'    'The king never made that law,' she answered, with some displeasure.
  'You may ask me as many as you please--that is, so long as they are  sensible.
  Only I may take a few thousand years to answer some of them.
  But that's nothing.
  Of all things time is the cheapest.
'    'Then would you mind telling me now, ma'am, for I feel very confused  about it--are you the Lady of the Silver Moon?'    'Yes, Curdie; you may call me that if you like.
  What it means is true.
'    'And now I see you dark, and clothed in green, and the mother of all  the light that dwells in the stones of the earth!  And up there they  call you Old Mother Wotherwop!  And the Princess Irene told me you were  her great-great-grandmother!  And you spin the spider threads, and take  care of a whole people of pigeons; and you are worn to a pale shadow  with old age; and are as young as anybody can be, not to be too young;  and as strong, I do believe, as I am.
'    The lady stooped toward a large green stone bedded in the rock of the  floor, and looking like a well of grassy light in it.
  She laid hold of  it with her fingers, broke it out, and gave it to Peter.
 'There!' cried  Curdie.
  'I told you so.
  Twenty men could not have done that.
  And  your fingers are white and smooth as any lady's in the land.
  I don't  know what to make of it.
'    'I could give you twenty names more to call me, Curdie, and not one of  them would be a false one.
  What does it matter how many names if the  person is one?'    'Ah!  But it is not names only, ma'am.
  Look at what you were like last  night, and what I see you now!'    'Shapes are only dresses, Curdie, and dresses are only names.
  That  which is inside is the same all the time.
'    'But then how can all the shapes speak the truth?'    'It would want thousands more to speak the truth, Curdie; and then they  could not.
  But there is a point I must not let you mistake about.
  It  is one thing the shape I choose to put on, and quite another the shape  that foolish talk and nursery tale may please to put upon me.
  Also, it  is one thing what you or your father may think about me, and quite  another what a foolish or bad man may see in me.
  For instance, if a  thief were to come in here just now, he would think he saw the demon of  the mine, all in green flames, come to protect her treasure, and would  run like a hunted wild goat.
  I should be all the same, but his evil  eyes would see me as I was not.
'    'I think I understand,' said Curdie.
    'Peter,' said the lady, turning then to him, 'you will have to give up  Curdie for a little while.
'    'So long as he loves us, ma'am, that will not matter--much.
'    'Ah! you are right there, my friend,' said the beautiful princess.
 And  as she said it she put out her hand, and took the hard, horny hand of  the miner in it, and held it for a moment lovingly.
    'I need say no more,' she added, 'for we understand each other--you and  I, Peter.
'    The tears came into Peter's eyes.
  He bowed his head in thankfulness,  and his heart was much too full to speak.
    Then the great old, young, beautiful princess turned to Curdie.
    'Now, Curdie, are you ready?' she said.
    'Yes, ma'am,' answered Curdie.
    'You do not know what for.
'    'You do, ma'am.
  That is enough.
'    'You could not have given me a better answer, or done more to prepare  yourself, Curdie,' she returned, with one of her radiant smiles.
  'Do  you think you will know me again?'    'I think so.
  But how can I tell what you may look like next?'    'Ah, that indeed!  How can you tell?  Or how could I expect you should?  But those who know me well, know me whatever new dress or shape or name  I may be in; and by and by you will have learned to do so too.
'    'But if you want me to know you again, ma'am, for certain sure,' said  Curdie, 'could you not give me some sign, or tell me something about  you that never changes--or some other way to know you, or thing to know  you by?'    'No, Curdie; that would be to keep you from knowing me.
  You must know  me in quite another way from that.
  It would not be the least use to  you or me either if I were to make you know me in that way.
 It would be  but to know the sign of Me--not to know me myself.
  It would be no  better than if I were to take this emerald out of my crown and give it  to you to take home with you, and you were to call it me, and talk to  it as if it heard and saw and loved you.
 Much good that would do you,  Curdie!  No; you must do what you can to know me, and if you do, you  will.
  You shall see me again in very different circumstances from  these, and, I will tell you so much, it may be in a very different  shape.
  But come now, I will lead you out of this cavern; my good Joan  will be getting too anxious about you.
  One word more: you will allow  that the men knew little what they were talking about this morning,  when they told all those tales of Old Mother Wotherwop; but did it  occur to you to think how it was they fell to talking about me at all?  It was because I came to them; I was beside them all the time they were  talking about me, though they were far enough from knowing it, and had  very little besides foolishness to say.
'    As she spoke she turned and led the way from the cavern, which, as if a  door had been closed, sank into absolute blackness behind them.
  And  now they saw nothing more of the lady except the green star, which  again seemed a good distance in front of them, and to which they came  no nearer, although following it at a quick pace through the mountain.
  Such was their confidence in her guidance, however, and so fearless  were they in consequence, that they felt their way neither with hand  nor foot, but walked straight on through the pitch-dark galleries.
  When at length the night of the upper world looked in at the mouth of  the mine, the green light seemed to lose its way among the stars, and  they saw it no more.
    Out they came into the cool, blessed night.
  It was very late, and only  starlight.
  To their surprise, three paces away they saw, seated upon a  stone, an old country-woman, in a cloak which they took for black.
  When they came close up to it, they saw it was red.
    'Good evening!' said Peter.
    'Good evening!' returned the old woman, in a voice as old as herself.
    But Curdie took off his cap and said:    'I am your servant, Princess.
'    The old woman replied:    'Come to me in the dove tower tomorrow night, Curdie--alone.
'    'I will, ma'am,' said Curdie.
    So they parted, and father and son went home to wife and mother--two  persons in one rich, happy woman.
            Curdie's Mission    The next night Curdie went home from the mine a little earlier than  usual, to make himself tidy before going to the dove tower.
  The  princess had not appointed an exact time for him to be there; he would  go as near the time he had gone first as he could.
  On his way to the  bottom of the hill, he met his father coming up.
  The sun was then  down, and the warm first of the twilight filled the evening.
  He came  rather wearily up the hill: the road, he thought, must have grown  steeper in parts since he was Curdie's age.
  His back was to the light  of the sunset, which closed him all round in a beautiful setting, and  Curdie thought what a grand-looking man his father was, even when he  was tired.
  It is greed and laziness and selfishness, not hunger or  weariness or cold, that take the dignity out of a man, and make him  look mean.
    'Ah, Curdie!  There you are!' he said, seeing his son come bounding  along as if it were morning with him and not evening.
    'You look tired, Father,' said Curdie.
    'Yes, my boy.
  I'm not so young as you.
'    'Nor so old as the princess,' said Curdie.
    'Tell me this,' said Peter, 'why do people talk about going downhill  when they begin to get old?  It seems to me that then first they begin  to go uphill.
'    'You looked to me, Father, when I caught sight of you, as if you had  been climbing the hill all your life, and were soon to get to the top.
'    'Nobody can tell when that will be,' returned Peter.
  'We're so ready  to think we're just at the top when it lies miles away.
  But I must not  keep you, my boy, for you are wanted; and we shall be anxious to know  what the princess says to you--that is, if she will allow you to tell  us.
'    'I think she will, for she knows there is nobody more to be trusted  than my father and mother,' said Curdie, with pride.
    And away he shot, and ran, and jumped, and seemed almost to fly down  the long, winding, steep path, until he came to the gate of the king's  house.
    There he met an unexpected obstruction: in the open door stood the  housekeeper, and she seemed to broaden herself out until she almost  filled the doorway.
    'So!' she said, 'it's you, is it, young man?  You are the person that  comes in and goes out when he pleases, and keeps running up and down my  stairs without ever saying by your leave, or even wiping his shoes, and  always leaves the door open!  Don't you know this is my house?'    'No, I do not,' returned Curdie respectfully.
  'You forget, ma'am, that  it is the king's house.
'    'That is all the same.
  The king left it to me to take care of--and  that you shall know!'    'Is the king dead, ma'am, that he has left it to you?' asked Curdie,  half in doubt from the self-assertion of the woman.
    'Insolent fellow!' exclaimed the housekeeper.
  'Don't you see by my  dress that I am in the king's service?'    'And am I not one of his miners?'    'Ah! that goes for nothing.
  I am one of his household.
  You are an  out-of-doors labourer.
  You are a nobody.
  You carry a pickaxe.
  I  carry the keys at my girdle.
  See!'    'But you must not call one a nobody to whom the king has spoken,' said  Curdie.
    'Go along with you!' cried the housekeeper, and would have shut the  door in his face, had she not been afraid that when she stepped back he  would step in ere she could get it in motion, for it was very heavy and  always seemed unwilling to shut.
  Curdie came a pace nearer.
  She  lifted the great house key from her side, and threatened to strike him  down with it, calling aloud on Mar and Whelk and Plout, the menservants  under her, to come and help her.
 Ere one of them could answer, however,  she gave a great shriek and turned and fled, leaving the door wide open.
    Curdie looked behind him, and saw an animal whose gruesome oddity even  he, who knew so many of the strange creatures, two of which were never  the same, that used to live inside the mountain with their masters the  goblins, had never seen equalled.
  Its eyes were flaming with anger,  but it seemed to be at the housekeeper, for it came cowering and  creeping up and laid its head on the ground at Curdie's feet.
  Curdie  hardly waited to look at it, however, but ran into the house, eager to  get up the stairs before any of the men should come to annoy--he had no  fear of their preventing him.
 Without halt or hindrance, though the  passages were nearly dark, he reached the door of the princess's  workroom, and knocked.
    'Come in,' said the voice of the princess.
    Curdie opened the door--but, to his astonishment, saw no room there.
  Could he have opened a wrong door?  There was the great sky, and the  stars, and beneath he could see nothing only darkness! But what was  that in the sky, straight in front of him?  A great wheel of fire,  turning and turning, and flashing out blue lights!    'Come in, Curdie,' said the voice again.
    'I would at once, ma'am,' said Curdie, 'if I were sure I was standing  at your door.
'    'Why should you doubt it, Curdie?'    'Because I see neither walls nor floor, only darkness and the great  sky.
'    'That is all right, Curdie.
  Come in.
'    Curdie stepped forward at once.
  He was indeed, for the very crumb of a  moment, tempted to feel before him with his foot; but he saw that would  be to distrust the princess, and a greater rudeness he could not offer  her.
  So he stepped straight in--I will not say without a little  tremble at the thought of finding no floor beneath his foot.
  But that  which had need of the floor found it, and his foot was satisfied.
    No sooner was he in than he saw that the great revolving wheel in the  sky was the princess's spinning wheel, near the other end of the room,  turning very fast.
  He could see no sky or stars any more, but the  wheel was flashing out blue--oh, such lovely sky-blue light!--and  behind it of course sat the princess, but whether an old woman as thin  as a skeleton leaf, or a glorious lady as young as perfection, he could  not tell for the turning and flashing of the wheel.
    'Listen to the wheel,' said the voice which had already grown dear to  Curdie: its very tone was precious like a jewel, not as a jewel, for no  jewel could compare with it in preciousness.
    And Curdie listened and listened.
    'What is it saying?' asked the voice.
    'It is singing,' answered Curdie.
    'What is it singing?'    Curdie tried to make out, but thought he could not; for no sooner had  he got hold of something than it vanished again.
    Yet he listened, and listened, entranced with delight.
    'Thank you, Curdie, said the voice.
    'Ma'am,' said Curdie, 'I did try hard for a while, but I could not make  anything of it.
'    'Oh yes, you did, and you have been telling it to me!  Shall I tell you  again what I told my wheel, and my wheel told you, and you have just  told me without knowing it?'    'Please, ma'am.
'    Then the lady began to sing, and her wheel spun an accompaniment to her  song, and the music of the wheel was like the music of an Aeolian harp  blown upon by the wind that bloweth where it listeth.
 Oh, the sweet  sounds of that spinning wheel!  Now they were gold, now silver, now  grass, now palm trees, now ancient cities, now rubies, now mountain  brooks, now peacock's feathers, now clouds, now snowdrops, and now  mid-sea islands.
  But for the voice that sang through it all, about  that I have no words to tell.
  It would make you weep if I were able to  tell you what that was like, it was so beautiful and true and lovely.
  But this is something like the words of its song:        The stars are spinning their threads,    And the clouds are the dust that flies,    And the suns are weaving them up    For the time when the sleepers shall rise.
      The ocean in music rolls,    And gems are turning to eyes,    And the trees are gathering souls    For the day when the sleepers shall rise.
      The weepers are learning to smile,    And laughter to glean the sighs;    Burn and bury the care and guile,    For the day when the sleepers shall rise.
      Oh, the dews and the moths and the daisy red,    The larks and the glimmers and flows!    The lilies and sparrows and daily bread,    And the something that nobody knows!      The princess stopped, her wheel stopped, and she laughed.
  And her  laugh was sweeter than song and wheel; sweeter than running brook and  silver bell; sweeter than joy itself, for the heart of the laugh was  love.
    'Come now, Curdie, to this side of my wheel, and you will find me,' she  said; and her laugh seemed sounding on still in the words, as if they  were made of breath that had laughed.
    Curdie obeyed, and passed the wheel, and there she stood to receive  him!--fairer than when he saw her last, a little younger still, and  dressed not in green and emeralds, but in pale blue, with a coronet of  silver set with pearls, and slippers covered with opals that gleamed  every colour of the rainbow.
  It was some time before Curdie could take  his eyes from the marvel of her loveliness.
 Fearing at last that he was  rude, he turned them away; and, behold, he was in a room that was for  beauty marvellous!  The lofty ceiling was all a golden vine, Whose  great clusters of carbuncles, rubies, and chrysoberyls hung down like  the bosses of groined arches, and in its centre hung the most glorious  lamp that human eyes ever saw--the Silver Moon itself, a globe of  silver, as it seemed, with a heart of light so wondrous potent that it  rendered the mass translucent, and altogether radiant.
    The room was so large that, looking back, he could scarcely see the end  at which he entered; but the other was only a few yards from him--and  there he saw another wonder: on a huge hearth a great fire was burning,  and the fire was a huge heap of roses, and yet it was fire.
  The smell  of the roses filled the air, and the heat of the flames of them glowed  upon his face.
  He turned an inquiring look upon the lady, and saw that  she was now seated in an ancient chair, the legs of which were crusted  with gems, but the upper part like a nest of daisies and moss and green  grass.
    'Curdie,' she said in answer to his eyes, 'you have stood more than one  trial already, and have stood them well: now I am going to put you to a  harder.
  Do you think you are prepared for it?'    'How can I tell, ma'am,' he returned, 'seeing I do not know what it is,  or what preparation it needs?  Judge me yourself, ma'am.
'    'It needs only trust and obedience,' answered the lady.
    'I dare not say anything, ma'am.
  If you think me fit, command me.
'    'It will hurt you terribly, Curdie, but that will be all; no real hurt  but much good will come to you from it.
'    Curdie made no answer but stood gazing with parted lips in the lady's  face.
    'Go and thrust both your hands into that fire,' she said quickly,  almost hurriedly.
    Curdie dared not stop to think.
  It was much too terrible to think  about.
  He rushed to the fire, and thrust both of his hands right into  the middle of the heap of flaming roses, and his arms halfway up to the  elbows.
  And it did hurt!  But he did not draw them back.
 He held the  pain as if it were a thing that would kill him if he let it go--as  indeed it would have done.
  He was in terrible fear lest it should  conquer him.
    But when it had risen to the pitch that he thought he could bear it no  longer, it began to fall again, and went on growing less and less until  by contrast with its former severity it had become rather pleasant.
  At  last it ceased altogether, and Curdie thought his hands must be burned  to cinders if not ashes, for he did not feel them at all.
  The princess  told him to take them out and look at them.
  He did so, and found that  all that was gone of them was the rough, hard skin; they were white and  smooth like the princess's.
    'Come to me,' she said.
    He obeyed and saw, to his surprise, that her face looked as if she had  been weeping.
    'Oh, Princess!  What is the matter?' he cried.
  'Did I make a noise and  vex you?'    'No, Curdie, she answered; 'but it was very bad.
'    'Did you feel it too then?'    'Of course I did.
  But now it is over, and all is well.
  Would you like  to know why I made You put your hands in the fire?' Curdie looked at  them again--then said:    'To take the marks of the work off them and make them fit for the  king's court, I suppose.
'    'No, Curdie,' answered the princess, shaking her head, for she was not  pleased with the answer.
  'It would be a poor way of making your hands  fit for the king's court to take off them signs of his service.
  There  is a far greater difference on them than that.
  Do you feel none?'    'No, ma'am.
'    'You will, though, by and by, when the time comes.
  But perhaps even  then you might not know what had been given you, therefore I will tell  you.
  Have you ever heard what some philosophers say--that men were all  animals once?'    'No, ma'am.
'    'It is of no consequence.
  But there is another thing that is of the  greatest consequence--this: that all men, if they do not take care, go  down the hill to the animals' country; that many men are actually, all  their lives, going to be beasts.
  People knew it once, but it is long  since they forgot it.
'    'I am not surprised to hear it, ma'am, when I think of some of our  miners.
'    'Ah!  But you must beware, Curdie, how you say of this man or that man  that he is travelling beastward.
  There are not nearly so many going  that way as at first sight you might think.
  When you met your father  on the hill tonight, you stood and spoke together on the same spot; and  although one of you was going up and the other coming down, at a little  distance no one could have told which was bound in the one direction  and which in the other.
  Just so two people may be at the same spot in  manners and behaviour, and yet one may be getting better and the other  worse, which is just the greatest of all differences that could  possibly exist between them.
'    'But ma'am,' said Curdie, 'where is the good of knowing that there is  such a difference, if you can never know where it is?'    'Now, Curdie, you must mind exactly what words I use, because although  the right words cannot do exactly what I want them to do, the wrong  words will certainly do what I do not want them to do.
 I did not say  you can never know.
  When there is a necessity for your knowing, when  you have to do important business with this or that man, there is  always a way of knowing enough to keep you from any great blunder.
  And  as you will have important business to do by and by, and that with  people of whom you yet know nothing, it will be necessary that you  should have some better means than usual of learning the nature of them.
    'Now listen.
  Since it is always what they do, whether in their minds  or their bodies, that makes men go down to be less than men, that is,  beasts, the change always comes first in their hands--and first of all  in the inside hands, to which the outside ones are but as the gloves.
  They do not know it of course; for a beast does not know that he is a  beast, and the nearer a man gets to being a beast the less he knows it.
  Neither can their best friends, or their worst enemies indeed, see any  difference in their hands, for they see only the living gloves of them.
  But there are not a few who feel a vague something repulsive in the  hand of a man who is growing a beast.
    'Now here is what the rose-fire has done for you: it has made your  hands so knowing and wise, it has brought your real hands so near the  outside of your flesh gloves, that you will henceforth be able to know  at once the hand of a man who is growing into a beast; nay, more--you  will at once feel the foot of the beast he is growing, just as if there  were no glove made like a man's hand between you and it.
    'Hence of course it follows that you will be able often, and with  further education in zoology, will be able always to tell, not only  when a man is growing a beast, but what beast he is growing to, for you  will know the foot--what it is and what beast's it is.
 According, then,  to your knowledge of that beast will be your knowledge of the man you  have to do with.
  Only there is one beautiful and awful thing about it,  that if any one gifted with this perception once uses it for his own  ends, it is taken from him, and then, not knowing that it is gone, he  is in a far worse condition than before, for he trusts to what he has  not got.
'    'How dreadful!' Said Curdie.
  'I must mind what I am about.
'    'Yes, indeed, Curdie.
'    'But may not one sometimes make a mistake without being able to help  it?'    'Yes.
  But so long as he is not after his own ends, he will never make  a serious mistake.
'    'I suppose you want me, ma'am, to warn every one whose hand tells me  that he is growing a beast--because, as you say, he does not know it  himself.
'    The princess smiled.
    'Much good that would do, Curdie!  I don't say there are no cases in  which it would be of use, but they are very rare and peculiar cases,  and if such come you will know them.
  To such a person there is in  general no insult like the truth.
  He cannot endure it, not because he  is growing a beast, but because he is ceasing to be a man.
  It is the  dying man in him that it makes uncomfortable, and he trots, or creeps,  or swims, or flutters out of its way--calls it a foolish feeling, a  whim, an old wives' fable, a bit of priests' humbug, an effete  superstition, and so on.
'    'And is there no hope for him?  Can nothing be done?  It's so awful to  think of going down, down, down like that!'    'Even when it's with his own will?'    'That's what seems to me to make it worst of all,' said Curdie.
    'You are right,' answered the princess, nodding her head; 'but there is  this amount of excuse to make for all such, remember--that they do not  know what or how horrid their coming fate is.
 Many a lady, so delicate  and nice that she can bear nothing coarser than the finest linen to  touch her body, if she had a mirror that could show her the animal she  is growing to, as it lies waiting within the fair skin and the fine  linen and the silk and the jewels, would receive a shock that might  possibly wake her up.
'    'Why then, ma'am, shouldn't she have it?'    The princess held her peace.
    'Come here, Lina,' she said after a long pause.
    From somewhere behind Curdie, crept forward the same hideous animal  which had fawned at his feet at the door, and which, without his  knowing it, had followed him every step up the dove tower.
  She ran to  the princess, and lay down flat at her feet, looking up at her with an  expression so pitiful that in Curdie's heart it overcame all the  ludicrousness of her horrible mass of incongruities.
  She had a very  short body, and very long legs made like an elephant's, so that in  lying down she kneeled with both pairs.
  Her tail, which dragged on the  floor behind her, was twice as long and quite as thick as her body.
  Her head was something between that of a polar bear and a snake.
  Her  eyes were dark green, with a yellow light in them.
  Her under teeth  came up like a fringe of icicles, only very white, outside of her upper  lip.
  Her throat looked as if the hair had been plucked off.
  It showed  a skin white and smooth.
    'Give Curdie a paw, Lina,' said the princess.
    The creature rose, and, lifting a long foreleg, held up a great doglike  paw to Curdie.
  He took it gently.
  But what a shudder, as of terrified  delight, ran through him, when, instead of the paw of a dog, such as it  seemed to his eyes, he clasped in his great mining fist the soft, neat  little hand of a child!  He took it in both of his, and held it as if  he could not let it go.
  The green eyes stared at him with their yellow  light, and the mouth was turned up toward him with its constant half  grin; but here was the child's hand!  If he could but pull the child  out of the beast! His eyes sought the princess.
  She was watching him  with evident satisfaction.
    'Ma'am, here is a child's hand!' said Curdie.
    'Your gift does more for you than it promised.
  It is yet better to  perceive a hidden good than a hidden evil.
'    'But,' began Curdie.
    'I am not going to answer any more questions this evening,' interrupted  the princess.
  'You have not half got to the bottom of the answers I  have already given you.
  That paw in your hand now might almost teach  you the whole science of natural history--the heavenly sort, I mean.
'    'I will think,' said Curdie.
  'But oh! please! one word more: may I  tell my father and mother all about it?'    'Certainly--though perhaps now it may be their turn to find it a little  difficult to believe that things went just as you must tell them.
'    'They shall see that I believe it all this time,' said Curdie.
    'Tell them that tomorrow morning you must set out for the court--not  like a great man, but just as poor as you are.
  They had better not  speak about it.
  Tell them also that it will be a long time before they  hear of you again, but they must not lose heart.
  And tell your father  to lay that stone I gave him at night in a safe place--not because of  the greatness of its price, although it is such an emerald as no prince  has in his crown, but because it will be a news-bearer between you and  him.
  As often as he gets at all anxious about you, he must take it and  lay it in the fire, and leave it there when he goes to bed.
  In the  morning he must find it in the ashes, and if it be as green as ever,  then all goes well with you; if it have lost colour, things go ill with  you; but if it be very pale indeed, then you are in great danger, and  he must come to me.
'    'Yes, ma'am,' said Curdie.
  'Please, am I to go now?'    'Yes,' answered the princess, and held out her hand to him.
    Curdie took it, trembling with joy.
  It was a very beautiful hand--not  small, very smooth, but not very soft--and just the same to his  fire-taught touch that it was to his eyes.
  He would have stood there  all night holding it if she had not gently withdrawn it.
    'I will provide you a servant,' she said, 'for your journey and to wait  upon you afterward.
'    'But where am I to go, ma'am, and what am I to do?  You have given me  no message to carry, neither have you said what I am wanted for.
 I go  without a notion whether I am to walk this way or that, or what I am to  do when I get I don't know where.
'    'Curdie!' said the princess, and there was a tone of reminder in his  own name as she spoke it, 'did I not tell you to tell your father and  mother that you were to set out for the court?  And you know that lies  to the north.
  You must learn to use far less direct directions than  that.
  You must not be like a dull servant that needs to be told again  and again before he will understand.
  You have orders enough to start  with, and you will find, as you go on, and as you need to know, what  you have to do.
  But I warn you that perhaps it will not look the least  like what you may have been fancying I should require of you.
  I have  one idea of you and your work, and you have another.
  I do not blame  you for that--you cannot help it yet; but you must be ready to let my  idea, which sets you working, set your idea right.
  Be true and honest  and fearless, and all shall go well with you and your work, and all  with whom your work lies, and so with your parents--and me too,  Curdie,' she added after a little pause.
    The young miner bowed his head low, patted the strange head that lay at  the princess's feet, and turned away.
  As soon as he passed the  spinning wheel, which looked, in the midst of the glorious room, just  like any wheel you might find in a country cottage--old and worn and  dingy and dusty--the splendour of the place vanished, and he saw but  the big bare room he seemed at first to have entered, with the  moon--the princess's moon no doubt--shining in at one of the windows  upon the spinning wheel.
            Hands    Curdie went home, pondering much, and told everything to his father and  mother.
  As the old princess had said, it was now their turn to find  what they heard hard to believe.
  If they had not been able to trust  Curdie himself, they would have refused to believe more than the half  of what he reported, then they would have refused that half too, and at  last would most likely for a time have disbelieved in the very  existence of the princess, what evidence their own senses had given  them notwithstanding.
    For he had nothing conclusive to show in proof of what he told them.
  When he held out his hands to them, his mother said they looked as if  he had been washing them with soft soap, only they did smell of  something nicer than that, and she must allow it was more like roses  than anything else she knew.
  His father could not see any difference  upon his hands, but then it was night, he said, and their poor little  lamp was not enough for his old eyes.
  As to the feel of them, each of  his own hands, he said, was hard and horny enough for two, and it must  be the fault of the dullness of his own thick skin that he felt no  change on Curdie's palms.
    'Here, Curdie,' said his mother, 'try my hand, and see what beast's paw  lies inside it.
'    'No, Mother,' answered Curdie, half beseeching, half indignant, 'I will  not insult my new gift by making pretence to try it.
  That would be  mockery.
  There is no hand within yours but the hand of a true woman,  my mother.
'    'I should like you just to take hold of my hand though,' said his  mother.
  'You are my son, and may know all the bad there is in me.
'    Then at once Curdie took her hand in his.
  And when he had it, he kept  it, stroking it gently with his other hand.
    'Mother,' he said at length, 'your hand feels just like that of the  princess.
'    'What!  My horny, cracked, rheumatic old hand, with its big joints, and  its short nails all worn down to the quick with hard work--like the  hand of the beautiful princess!  Why, my child, you will make me fancy  your fingers have grown very dull indeed, instead of sharp and  delicate, if you talk such nonsense.
  Mine is such an ugly hand I  should be ashamed to show it to any but one that loved me.
  But love  makes all safe--doesn't it, Curdie?'    'Well, Mother, all I can say is that I don't feel a roughness, or a  crack, or a big joint, or a short nail.
  Your hand feels just and  exactly, as near as I can recollect, and it's not more than two hours  since I had it in mine--well, I will say, very like indeed to that of  the old princess.
'    'Go away, you flatterer,' said his mother, with a smile that showed how  she prized the love that lay beneath what she took for its hyperbole.
  The praise even which one cannot accept is sweet from a true mouth.
  'If that is all your new gift can do, it won't make a warlock of you,'  she added.
    'Mother, it tells me nothing but the truth,' insisted Curdie, 'however  unlike the truth it may seem.
  It wants no gift to tell what anybody's  outside hands are like.
  But by it I know your inside hands are like  the princess's.
'    'And I am sure the boy speaks true,' said Peter.
  'He only says about  your hand what I have known ever so long about yourself, Joan.
  Curdie,  your mother's foot is as pretty a foot as any lady's in the land, and  where her hand is not so pretty it comes of killing its beauty for you  and me, my boy.
  And I can tell you more, Curdie.
  I don't know much  about ladies and gentlemen, but I am sure your inside mother must be a  lady, as her hand tells you, and I will try to say how I know it.
  This  is how: when I forget myself looking at her as she goes about her  work--and that happens often as I grow older--I fancy for a moment or  two that I am a gentleman; and when I wake up from my little dream, it  is only to feel the more strongly that I must do everything as a  gentleman should.
  I will try to tell you what I mean, Curdie.
  If a  gentleman--I mean a real gentleman, not a pretended one, of which sort  they say there are a many above ground--if a real gentleman were to  lose all his money and come down to work in the mines to get bread for  his family--do you think, Curdie, he would work like the lazy ones?  Would he try to do as little as he could for his wages?  I know the  sort of the true gentleman pretty near as well as he does himself.
  And  my wife, that's your mother, Curdie, she's a true lady, you may take my  word for it, for it's she that makes me want to be a true gentleman.
  Wife, the boy is in the right about your hand.
'    'Now, Father, let me feel yours,' said Curdie, daring a little more.
    'No, no, my boy,' answered Peter.
  'I don't want to hear anything about  my hand or my head or my heart.
  I am what I am, and I hope growing  better, and that's enough.
  No, you shan't feel my hand.
 You must go to  bed, for you must start with the sun.
'    It was not as if Curdie had been leaving them to go to prison, or to  make a fortune, and although they were sorry enough to lose him, they  were not in the least heartbroken or even troubled at his going.
    As the princess had said he was to go like the poor man he was, Curdie  came down in the morning from his little loft dressed in his working  clothes.
  His mother, who was busy getting his breakfast for him, while  his father sat reading to her out of an old book, would have had him  put on his holiday garments, which, she said, would look poor enough  among the fine ladies and gentlemen he was going to.
  But Curdie said  he did not know that he was going among ladies and gentlemen, and that  as work was better than play, his workday clothes must on the whole be  better than his playday Clothes; and as his father accepted the  argument, his mother gave in.
  When he had eaten his breakfast, she  took a pouch made of goatskin, with the long hair on it, filled it with  bread and cheese, and hung it over his shoulder.
  Then his father gave  him a stick he had cut for him in the wood, and he bade them good-bye  rather hurriedly, for he was afraid of breaking down.
  As he went out  he caught up his mattock and took it with him.
  It had on the one side  a pointed curve of strong steel for loosening the earth and the ore,  and on the other a steel hammer for breaking the stones and rocks.
  Just as he crossed the threshold the sun showed the first segment of  his disc above the horizon.
            The Heath    He had to go to the bottom of the hill to get into a country he could  cross, for the mountains to the north were full of precipices, and it  would have been losing time to go that way.
  Not until he had reached  the king's house was it any use to turn northwards.
  Many a look did he  raise, as he passed it, to the dove tower, and as long as it was in  sight, but he saw nothing of the lady of the pigeons.
    On and on he fared, and came in a few hours to a country where there  were no mountains more--only hills, with great stretches of desolate  heath.
  Here and there was a village, but that brought him little  pleasure, for the people were rougher and worse mannered than those in  the mountains, and as he passed through, the children came behind and  mocked him.
    'There's a monkey running away from the mines!' they cried.
 Sometimes  their parents came out and encouraged them.
    'He doesn't want to find gold for the king any longer--the lazybones!'  they would say.
  'He'll be well taxed down here though, and he won't  like that either.
'    But it was little to Curdie that men who did not know what he was about  should not approve of his proceedings.
  He gave them a merry answer now  and then, and held diligently on his way.
  When they got so rude as  nearly to make him angry, he would treat them as he used to treat the  goblins, and sing his own songs to keep out their foolish noises.
  Once  a child fell as he turned to run away after throwing a stone at him.
  He picked him up, kissed him, and carried him to his mother.
  The woman  had run out in terror when she saw the strange miner about, as she  thought, to take vengeance on her boy.
  When he put him in her arms,  she blessed him, and Curdie went on his way rejoicing.
    And so the day went on, and the evening came, and in the middle of a  great desolate heath he began to feel tired, and sat down under an  ancient hawthorn, through which every now and then a lone wind that  seemed to come from nowhere and to go nowhither sighed and hissed.
  It  was very old and distorted.
  There was not another tree for miles all  around.
  It seemed to have lived so long, and to have been so torn and  tossed by the tempests on that moor, that it had at last gathered a  wind of its own, which got up now and then, tumbled itself about, and  lay down again.
    Curdie had been so eager to get on that he had eaten nothing since his  breakfast.
  But he had had plenty of water, for Many little streams had  crossed his path.
  He now opened the wallet his mother had given him,  and began to eat his supper.
  The sun was setting.
 A few clouds had  gathered about the west, but there was not a single cloud anywhere else  to be seen.
    Now Curdie did not know that this was a part of the country very hard  to get through.
  Nobody lived there, though many had tried to build in  it.
  Some died very soon.
  Some rushed out of it.
  Those who stayed  longest went raving mad, and died a terrible death.
 Such as walked  straight on, and did not spend a night there, got through well and were  nothing the worse.
  But those who slept even a single night in it were  sure to meet with something they could never forget, and which often  left a mark everybody could read.
 And that old hawthorn Might have been  enough for a warning--it looked so like a human being dried up and  distorted with age and suffering, with cares instead of loves, and  things instead of thoughts.
  Both it and the heath around it, which  stretched on all sides as far as he could see, were so withered that it  was impossible to say whether they were alive or not.
    And while Curdie ate there came a change.
  Clouds had gathered over his  head, and seemed drifting about in every direction, as if not  'shepherded by the slow, unwilling wind,' but hunted in all directions  by wolfish flaws across the plains of the sky.
  The sun was going down  in a storm of lurid crimson, and out of the west came a wind that felt  red and hot the one moment, and cold and pale the other.
  And very  strangely it sang in the dreary old hawthorn tree, and very cheerily it  blew about Curdie, now making him creep close up to the tree for  shelter from its shivery cold, now fan himself with his cap, it was so  sultry and stifling.
  It seemed to come from the deathbed of the sun,  dying in fever and ague.
    And as he gazed at the sun, now on the verge of the horizon, very large  and very red and very dull--for though the clouds had broken away a  dusty fog was spread all over the disc--Curdie saw something strange  appear against it, moving about like a fly over its burning face.
  This  looked as if it were coming out of the sun's furnace heart, and was a  living creature of some kind surely; but its shape was very uncertain,  because the dazzle of the light all around melted the outlines.
    It was growing larger, it must be approaching!  It grew so rapidly that  by the time the sun was half down its head reached the top of the arch,  and presently nothing but its legs were to be seen, crossing and  recrossing the face of the vanishing disc.
    When the sun was down he could see nothing of it more, but in a moment  he heard its feet galloping over the dry crackling heather, and seeming  to come straight for him.
  He stood up, lifted his pickaxes and threw  the hammer end over his shoulder: he was going to have a fight for his  life!  And now it appeared again, vague, yet very awful, in the dim  twilight the sun had left behind.
  But just before it reached him, down  from its four long legs it dropped flat on the ground, and came  crawling towards him, wagging a huge tail as it came.
            Lina    It was Lina.
  All at once Curdie recognized her--the frightful creature  he had seen at the princess's.
  He dropped his pickaxes and held out  his hand.
  She crept nearer and nearer, and laid her chin in his palm,  and he patted her ugly head.
  Then she crept away behind the tree, and  lay down, panting hard.
    Curdie did not much like the idea of her being behind him.
 Horrible as  she was to look at, she seemed to his mind more horrible when he was  not looking at her.
  But he remembered the child's hand, and never  thought of driving her away.
  Now and then he gave a glance behind him,  and there she lay flat, with her eyes closed and her terrible teeth  gleaming between her two huge forepaws.
    After his supper and his long day's journey it was no wonder Curdie  should now be sleepy.
  Since the sun set the air had been warm and  pleasant.
  He lay down under the tree, closed his eyes, and thought to  sleep.
  He found himself mistaken, however.
  But although he could not  sleep, he was yet aware of resting delightfully.
    Presently he heard a sweet sound of singing somewhere, such as he had  never heard before--a singing as of curious birds far off, which drew  nearer and nearer.
  At length he heard their wings, and, opening his  eyes, saw a number of very large birds, as it seemed, alighting around  him, still singing.
  It was strange to hear song from the throats of  such big birds.
    And still singing, with large and round but not the less birdlike  voices, they began to weave a strange dance about him, moving their  wings in time with their legs.
  But the dance seemed somehow to be  troubled and broken, and to return upon itself in an eddy, in place of  sweeping smoothly on.
    And he soon learned, in the low short growls behind him, the cause of  the imperfection: they wanted to dance all round the tree, but Lina  would not permit them to come on her side.
    Now curdie liked the birds, and did not altogether like Lina.
  But  neither, nor both together, made a reason for driving away the  princess's creature.
  Doubtless she had been the goblins' creature, but  the last time he saw her was in the king's house and the dove tower,  and at the old princess's feet.
  So he left her to do as she would, and  the dance of the birds continued only a semicircle, troubled at the  edges, and returning upon itself.
    But their song and their motions, nevertheless, and the waving of their  wings, began at length to make him very sleepy.
  All the time he had  kept doubting whether they could really be birds, and the sleepier he  got, the more he imagined them something else, but he suspected no harm.
    Suddenly, just as he was sinking beneath the waves of slumber, he awoke  in fierce pain.
  The birds were upon him--all over him--and had begun  to tear him with beaks and claws.
  He had but time, however, to feel  that he could not move under their weight, when they set up a hideous  screaming, and scattered like a cloud.
  Lina was among them, snapping  and striking with her paws, while her tail knocked them over and over.
  But they flew up, gathered, and descended on her in a swarm, perching  upon every part of her body, so that he could see only a huge misshapen  mass, which seemed to go rolling away into the darkness.
  He got up and  tried to follow, but could see nothing, and after wandering about  hither and thither for some time, found himself again beside the  hawthorn.
  He feared greatly that the birds had been too much for Lina,  and had torn her to pieces.
  In a little while, however, she came  limping back, and lay down in her old place.
  Curdie also lay down,  but, from the pain of his wounds, there was no sleep for him.
  When the  light came he found his clothes a good deal torn and his skin as well,  but gladly wondered why the wicked birds had not at once attacked his  eyes.
  Then he turned, looking for Lina.
  She rose and crept to him.
  But she was in far worse plight than he--plucked and gashed and torn  with the beaks and claws of the birds, especially about the bare part  of her neck, so that she was pitiful to see.
  And those worst wounds  she could not reach to lick.
    'Poor Lina!' said Curdie, 'you got all those helping me.
'    She wagged her tail, and made it clear she understood him.
  Then it  flashed upon Curdie's mind that perhaps this was the companion the  princess had promised him.
  For the princess did so many things  differently from what anybody looked for!  Lina was no beauty  certainly, but already, the first night, she had saved his life.
    'Come along, Lina,' he said, 'we want water.
'    She put her nose to the earth, and after snuffing for a moment, darted  off in a straight line.
  Curdie followed.
  The ground was so uneven,  that after losing sight of her many times, at last he seemed to have  lost her altogether.
  In a few minutes, however, he came upon her  waiting for him.
  Instantly she darted off again.
 After he had lost and  found her again many times, he found her the last time lying beside a  great stone.
  As soon as he came up she began scratching at it with her  paws.
  When he had raised it an inch or two, she shoved in first her  nose and then her teeth, and lifted with all the might of her neck.
    When at length between them they got it up, there was a beautiful  little well.
  He filled his cap with the clearest and sweetest water,  and drank.
  Then he gave to Lina, and she drank plentifully.
 Next he  washed her wounds very carefully.
  And as he did so, he noted how much  the bareness of her neck added to the strange repulsiveness of her  appearance.
  Then he bethought him of the goatskin wallet his mother  had given him, and taking it from his shoulders, tried whether it would  do to make a collar of for the poor animal.
  He found there was just  enough, and the hair so similar in colour to Lina's, that no one could  suspect it of having grown somewhere else.
    He took his knife, ripped up the seams of the wallet, and began trying  the skin to her neck.
  It was plain she understood perfectly what he  wished, for she endeavoured to hold her neck conveniently, turning it  this way and that while he contrived, with his rather scanty material,  to make the collar fit.
  As his mother had taken care to provide him  with needles and thread, he soon had a nice gorget ready for her.
  He  laced it on with one of his boot laces, which its long hair covered.
  Poor Lina looked much better in it.
 Nor could any one have called it a  piece of finery.
  If ever green eyes with a yellow light in them looked  grateful, hers did.
    As they had no longer any bag to carry them in, Curdie and Lina now ate  what was left of the provisions.
  Then they set out again upon their  journey.
  For seven days it lasted.
  They met with various adventures,  and in all of them Lina proved so helpful, and so ready to risk her  life for the sake of her companion, that Curdie grew not merely very  fond but very trustful of her; and her ugliness, which at first only  moved his pity, now actually increased his affection for her.
  One day,  looking at her stretched on the grass before him, he said:    'Oh, Lina!  If the princess would but burn you in her fire of roses!'    She looked up at him, gave a mournful whine like a dog, and laid her  head on his feet.
  What or how much he could not tell, but clearly she  had gathered something from his words.
            More Creatures    One day from morning till night they had been passing through a forest.
  As soon as the sun was down Curdie began to be aware that there were  more in it than themselves.
  First he saw only the swift rush of a  figure across the trees at some distance.
  Then he saw another and then  another at shorter intervals.
  Then he saw others both farther off and  nearer.
  At last, missing Lina and looking about after her, he saw an  appearance as marvellous as herself steal up to her, and begin  conversing with her after some beast fashion which evidently she  understood.
    Presently what seemed a quarrel arose between them, and stranger noises  followed, mingled with growling.
  At length it came to a fight, which  had not lasted long, however, before the creature of the wood threw  itself upon its back, and held up its paws to Lina.
 She instantly  walked on, and the creature got up and followed her.
 They had not gone  far before another strange animal appeared, approaching Lina, when  precisely the same thing was repeated, the vanquished animal rising and  following with the former.
  Again, and yet again, and again, a fresh  animal came up, seemed to be reasoned and certainly was fought with and  overcome by Lina, until at last, before they were out of the wood, she  was followed by forty-nine of the most grotesquely ugly, the most  extravagantly abnormal animals imagination can conceive.
  To describe  them were a hopeless task.
    I knew a boy who used to make animals out of heather roots.
 Wherever he  could find four legs, he was pretty sure to find a head and a tail.
  His beasts were a most comic menagerie, and right fruitful of laughter.
  But they were not so grotesque and extravagant as Lina and her  followers.
  One of them, for instance, was like a boa constrictor  walking on four little stumpy legs near its tail.
  About the same  distance from its head were two little wings, which it was forever  fluttering as if trying to fly with them.
  Curdie thought it fancied it  did fly with them, when it was merely plodding on busily with its four  little stumps.
  How it managed to keep up he could not think, till once  when he missed it from the group: the same moment he caught sight of  something at a distance plunging at an awful serpentine rate through  the trees, and presently, from behind a huge ash, this same creature  fell again into the group, quietly waddling along on its four stumps.
    Watching it after this, he saw that, when it was not able to keep up  any longer, and they had all got a little space ahead, it shot into the  wood away from the route, and made a great round, serpentine alone in  huge billows of motion, devouring the ground, undulating awfully,  galloping as if it were all legs together, and its four stumps nowhere.
  In this mad fashion it shot ahead, and, a few minutes after, toddled in  again among the rest, walking peacefully and somewhat painfully on its  few fours.
    From the time it takes to describe one of them it will be readily seen  that it would hardly do to attempt a description of each of the  forty-nine.
  They were not a goodly company, but well worth  contemplating, nevertheless; and Curdie had been too long used to the  goblins' creatures in the mines and on the mountain, to feel the least  uncomfortable at being followed by such a herd.
  On the contrary, the  marvellous vagaries of shape they manifested amused him greatly, and  shortened the journey much.
    Before they were all gathered, however, it had got so dark that he  could see some of them only a part at a time, and every now and then,  as the company wandered on, he would be startled by some extraordinary  limb or feature, undreamed of by him before, thrusting itself out of  the darkness into the range of his ken.
 Probably there were some of his  old acquaintances among them, although such had been the conditions of  semi-darkness, in which alone he had ever seen any of them, that it was  not like he would be able to identify any of them.
    On they marched solemnly, almost in silence, for either with feet or  voice the creatures seldom made any noise.
  By the time they reached  the outside of the wood it was morning twilight.
  Into the open trooped  the strange torrent of deformity, each one following Lina.
  Suddenly  she stopped, turned towards them, and said something which they  understood, although to Curdie's ear the sounds she made seemed to have  no articulation.
  Instantly they all turned, and vanished in the  forest, and Lina alone came trotting lithely and clumsily after her  master.
            The Baker's Wife    They were now passing through a lovely country of hill and dale and  rushing stream.
  The hills were abrupt, with broken chasms for  watercourses, and deep little valleys full of trees.
  But now and then  they came to a larger valley, with a fine river, whose level banks and  the adjacent meadows were dotted all over with red and white kine,  while on the fields above, that sloped a little to the foot of the  hills, grew oats and barley and wheat, and on the sides of the hills  themselves vines hung and chestnuts rose.
    They came at last to a broad, beautiful river, up which they must go to  arrive at the city of Gwyntystorm, where the king had his court.
  As  they went the valley narrowed, and then the river, but still it was  wide enough for large boats.
  After this, while the river kept its  size, the banks narrowed, until there was only room for a road between  the river and the great Cliffs that overhung it.
 At last river and road  took a sudden turn, and lo! a great rock in the river, which dividing  flowed around it, and on the top of the rock the city, with lofty walls  and towers and battlements, and above the city the palace of the king,  built like a strong castle.
 But the fortifications had long been  neglected, for the whole country was now under one king, and all men  said there was no more need for weapons or walls.
  No man pretended to  love his neighbour, but every one said he knew that peace and quiet  behaviour was the best thing for himself, and that, he said, was quite  as useful, and a great deal more reasonable.
  The city was prosperous  and rich, and if everybody was not comfortable, everybody else said he  ought to be.
    When Curdie got up opposite the mighty rock, which sparkled all over  with crystals, he found a narrow bridge, defended by gates and  portcullis and towers with loopholes.
  But the gates stood wide open,  and were dropping from their great hinges; the portcullis was eaten  away with rust, and clung to the grooves evidently immovable; while the  loopholed towers had neither floor nor roof, and their tops were fast  filling up their interiors.
  Curdie thought it a pity, if only for  their old story, that they should be thus neglected.
  But everybody in  the city regarded these signs of decay as the best proof of the  prosperity of the place.
  Commerce and self-interest, they said, had  got the better of violence, and the troubles of the past were whelmed  in the riches that flowed in at their open gates.
    Indeed, there was one sect of philosophers in it which taught that it  would be better to forget all the past history of the city, were it not  that its former imperfections taught its present inhabitants how  superior they and their times were, and enabled them to glory over  their ancestors.
  There were even certain quacks in the city who  advertised pills for enabling people to think well of themselves, and  some few bought of them, but most laughed, and said, with evident  truth, that they did not require them.
  Indeed, the general theme of  discourse when they met was, how much wiser they were than their  fathers.
    Curdie crossed the river, and began to ascend the winding road that led  up to the city.
  They met a good many idlers, and all stared at them.
  It was no wonder they should stare, but there was an unfriendliness in  their looks which Curdie did not like.
  No one, however, offered them  any molestation: Lina did not invite liberties.
  After a long ascent,  they reached the principal gate of the city and entered.
    The street was very steep, ascending toward the palace, which rose in  great strength above all the houses.
  Just as they entered, a baker,  whose shop was a few doors inside the gate, came out in his white  apron, and ran to the shop of his friend, the barber, on the opposite  side of the way.
  But as he ran he stumbled and fell heavily.
  Curdie  hastened to help him up, and found he had bruised his forehead badly.
  He swore grievously at the stone for tripping him up, declaring it was  the third time he had fallen over it within the last month; and saying  what was the king about that he allowed such a stone to stick up  forever on the main street of his royal residence of Gwyntystorm!  What  was a king for if he would not take care of his people's heads!  And he  stroked his forehead tenderly.
    'Was it your head or your feet that ought to bear the blame of your  fall?' asked Curdie.
    'Why, you booby of a miner!  My feet, of course,' answered the baker.
    'Nay, then,' said Curdie, 'the king can't be to blame.
'    'Oh, I see!' said the baker.
  'You're laying a trap for me.
  Of course,  if you come to that, it was my head that ought to have looked after my  feet.
  But it is the king's part to look after us all, and have his  streets smooth.
'    'Well, I don't see, said Curdie, 'why the king should take care of the  baker, when the baker's head won't take care of the baker's feet.
'    'Who are you to make game of the king's baker?' cried the man in a rage.
    But, instead of answering, Curdie went up to the bump on the street  which had repeated itself on the baker's head, and turning the hammer  end of his mattock, struck it such a blow that it flew wide in pieces.
  Blow after blow he struck until he had levelled it with the street.
    But out flew the barber upon him in a rage.
 'What do you break my  window for, you rascal, with your pickaxe?'    'I am very sorry,' said Curdie.
  'It must have been a bit of stone that  flew from my mattock.
  I couldn't help it, you know.
'    'Couldn't help it!  A fine story!  What do you go breaking the rock  for--the very rock upon which the city stands?'    'Look at your friend's forehead,' said Curdie.
  'See what a lump he has  got on it with falling over that same stone.
'    'What's that to my window?' cried the barber.
  'His forehead can mend  itself; my poor window can't.
'    'But he's the king's baker,' said Curdie, more and more surprised at  the man's anger.
    'What's that to me?  This is a free city.
  Every man here takes care of  himself, and the king takes care of us all.
  I'll have the price of my  window out of you, or the exchequer shall pay for it.
'    Something caught Curdie's eye.
  He stooped, picked up a piece of the  stone he had just broken, and put it in his pocket.
    'I suppose you are going to break another of my windows with that  stone!' said the barber.
    'Oh no,' said Curdie.
  'I didn't mean to break your window, and I  certainly won't break another.
'    'Give me that stone,' said the barber.
    Curdie gave it him, and the barber threw it over the city wall.
    'I thought you wanted the stone,' said Curdie.
    'No, you fool!' answered the barber.
  'What should I want with a stone?'    Curdie stooped and picked up another.
    'Give me that stone,' said the barber.
    'No,' answered Curdie.
  'You have just told me YOU don't want a stone,  and I do.
'    The barber took Curdie by the collar.
    'Come, now!  You pay me for that window.
'    'How much?' asked Curdie.
    The barber said, 'A crown.
'  But the baker, annoyed at the  heartlessness of the barber, in thinking more of his broken window than  the bump on his friend's forehead, interfered.
    'No, no,' he said to Curdie; 'don't you pay any such sum.
  A little  pane like that cost only a quarter.
'    'Well, to be certain,' said Curdie, 'I'll give a half.
'  For he doubted  the baker as well as the barber.
  'Perhaps one day, if he finds he has  asked too much, he will bring me the difference.
'    'Ha! ha!' laughed the barber.
  'A fool and his money are soon parted.
'    But as he took the coin from Curdie's hand he grasped it in affected  reconciliation and real satisfaction.
  In Curdie's, his was the cold  smooth leathery palm of a monkey.
  He looked up, almost expecting to  see him pop the money in his cheek; but he had not yet got so far as  that, though he was well on the road to it: then he would have no other  pocket.
    'I'm glad that stone is gone, anyhow,' said the baker.
  'It was the  bane of my life.
  I had no idea how easy it was to remove it.
  Give me  your pickaxes young miner, and I will show you how a baker can make the  stones fly.
'    He caught the tool out of Curdie's hand, and flew at one of the  foundation stones of the gateway.
  But he jarred his arm terribly,  scarcely chipped the stone, dropped the mattock with a cry of pain, and  ran into his own shop.
  Curdie picked up his implement, and, looking  after the baker, saw bread in the window, and followed him in.
  But the  baker, ashamed of himself, and thinking he was coming to laugh at him,  popped out of the back door, and when Curdie entered, the baker's wife  came from the bakehouse to serve him.
 Curdie requested to know the  price of a certain good-sized loaf.
    Now the baker's wife had been watching what had passed since first her  husband ran out of the shop, and she liked the look of Curdie.
 Also she  was more honest than her husband.
  Casting a glance to the back door,  she replied:    'That is not the best bread.
  I will sell you a loaf of what we bake  for ourselves.
'  And when she had spoken she laid a finger on her lips.
  'Take care of yourself in this place, MY son,' she added.
  'They do not  love strangers.
  I was once a stranger here, and I know what I say.
'  Then fancying she heard her husband, 'That is a strange animal you  have,' she said, in a louder voice.
    'Yes,' answered Curdie.
  'She is no beauty, but she is very good, and  we love each other.
  Don't we, Lina?'    Lina looked up and whined.
  Curdie threw her the half of his loaf,  which she ate, while her master and the baker's wife talked a little.
  Then the baker's wife gave them some water, and Curdie having paid for  his loaf, he and Lina went up the street together.
            The Dogs of Gwyntystorm    The steep street led them straight up to a large market place with  butchers' shops, about which were many dogs.
  The moment they caught  sight of Lina, one and all they came rushing down upon her, giving her  no chance of explaining herself.
  When Curdie saw the dogs coming he  heaved up his mattock over his shoulder, and was ready, if they would  have it so.
  Seeing him thus prepared to defend his follower, a great  ugly bulldog flew at him.
  With the first blow Curdie struck him  through the brain and the brute fell dead at his feet.
  But he could  not at once recover his weapon, which stuck in the skull of his foe,  and a huge mastiff, seeing him thus hampered, flew at him next.
    Now Lina, who had shown herself so brave upon the road thither, had  grown shy upon entering the city, and kept always at Curdie's heel.
 But  it was her turn now.
  The moment she saw her master in danger she  seemed to go mad with rage.
  As the mastiff jumped at Curdie's throat,  Lina flew at him, seized him with her tremendous jaws, gave one roaring  grind, and he lay beside the bulldog with his neck broken.
  They were  the best dogs in the market, after the judgement of the butchers of  Gwyntystorm.
  Down came their masters, knives in hand.
    Curdie drew himself up fearlessly, mattock on shoulder, and awaited  their coming, while at his heel his awful attendant showed not only her  outside fringe of icicle teeth, but a double row of right serviceable  fangs she wore inside her mouth, and her green eyes flashed yellow as  gold.
  The butchers, not liking the look of either of them or of the  dogs at their feet, drew back, and began to remonstrate in the manner  of outraged men.
    'Stranger,' said the first, 'that bulldog is mine.
'    'Take him, then,' said Curdie, indignant.
    'You've killed him!'    'Yes--else he would have killed me.
'    'That's no business of mine.
'    'No?'    'No.
'    'That makes it the more mine, then.
'    'This sort of thing won't do, you know,' said the other butcher.
    'That's true,' said Curdie.
 'That's my mastiff,' said the butcher.
    'And as he ought to be,' said Curdie.
    'Your brute shall be burned alive for it,' said the butcher.
    'Not yet,' answered Curdie.
  'We have done no wrong.
  We were walking  quietly up your street when your dogs flew at us.
  If you don't teach  your dogs how to treat strangers, you must take the consequences.
'    'They treat them quite properly,' said the butcher.
  'What right has  any one to bring an abomination like that into our city?  The horror is  enough to make an idiot of every child in the place.
'    'We are both subjects of the king, and my poor animal can't help her  looks.
  How would you like to be served like that because you were  ugly?  She's not a bit fonder of her looks than you are--only what can  she do to change them?'    'I'll do to change them,' said the fellow.
    Thereupon the butchers brandished their long knives and advanced,  keeping their eyes upon Lina.
    'Don't be afraid, Lina,' cried Curdie.
  'I'll kill one--you kill the  other.
'    Lina gave a howl that might have terrified an army, and crouched ready  to spring.
  The butchers turned and ran.
    By this time a great crowd had gathered behind the butchers, and in it  a number of boys returning from school who began to stone the  strangers.
  It was a way they had with man or beast they did not expect  to make anything by.
  One of the stones struck Lina; she caught it in  her teeth and crunched it so that it fell in gravel from her mouth.
  Some of the foremost of the crowd saw this, and it terrified them.
  They drew back; the rest took fright from their retreat; the panic  spread; and at last the crowd scattered in all directions.
  They ran,  and cried out, and said the devil and his dam were come to Gwyntystorm.
  So Curdie and Lina were left standing unmolested in the market place.
  But the terror of them spread throughout the city, and everybody began  to shut and lock his door so that by the time the setting sun shone  down the street, there was not a shop left open, for fear of the devil  and his horrible dam.
  But all the upper windows within sight of them  were crowded with heads watching them where they stood lonely in the  deserted market place.
    Curdie looked carefully all round, but could not see one open door.
 He  caught sight of the sign of an inn, however, and laying down his  mattock, and telling Lina to take care of it, walked up to the door of  it and knocked.
  But the people in the house, instead of opening the  door, threw things at him from the windows.
  They would not listen to a  word he said, but sent him back to Lina with the blood running down his  face.
  When Lina saw that she leaped up in a fury and was rushing at  the house, into which she would certainly have broken; but Curdie  called her, and made her lie down beside him while he bethought him  what next he should do.
    'Lina,' he said, 'the people keep their gates open, but their houses  and their hearts shut.
'    As if she knew it was her presence that had brought this trouble upon  him, she rose and went round and round him, purring like a tigress, and  rubbing herself against his legs.
    Now there was one little thatched house that stood squeezed in between  two tall gables, and the sides of the two great houses shot out  projecting windows that nearly met across the roof of the little one,  so that it lay in the street like a doll's house.
  In this house lived  a poor old woman, with a grandchild.
  And because she never gossiped or  quarrelled, or chaffered in the market, but went without what she could  not afford, the people called her a witch, and would have done her many  an ill turn if they had not been afraid of her.
    Now while Curdie was looking in another direction the door opened, and  out came a little dark-haired, black-eyed, gypsy-looking child, and  toddled across the market place toward the outcasts.
  The moment they  saw her coming, Lina lay down flat on the road, and with her two huge  forepaws covered her mouth, while Curdie went to meet her, holding out  his arms.
  The little one came straight to him, and held up her mouth  to be kissed.
  Then she took him by the hand, and drew him toward the  house, and Curdie yielded to the silent invitation.
    But when Lina rose to follow, the child shrank from her, frightened a  little.
  Curdie took her up, and holding her on one arm, patted Lina  with the other hand.
  Then the child wanted also to pat doggy, as she  called her by a right bountiful stretch of courtesy, and having once  patted her, nothing would serve but Curdie must let her have a ride on  doggy.
  So he set her on Lina's back, holding her hand, and she rode  home in merry triumph, all unconscious of the hundreds of eyes staring  at her foolhardiness from the windows about the market place, or the  murmur of deep disapproval that rose from as many lips.
    At the door stood the grandmother to receive them.
  She caught the  child to her bosom with delight at her courage, welcomed Curdie, and  showed no dread of Lina.
  Many were the significant nods exchanged, and  many a one said to another that the devil and the witch were old  friends.
  But the woman was only a wise woman, who, having seen how  Curdie and Lina behaved to each other, judged from that what sort they  were, and so made them welcome to her house.
 She was not like her  fellow townspeople, for that they were strangers recommended them to  her.
    The moment her door was shut the other doors began to open, and soon  there appeared little groups here and there about a threshold, while a  few of the more courageous ventured out upon the square--all ready to  make for their houses again, however, upon the least sign of movement  in the little thatched one.
    The baker and the barber had joined one of these groups, and were  busily wagging their tongues against Curdie and his horrible beast.
    'He can't be honest,' said the barber; 'for he paid me double the worth  of the pane he broke in my window.
'    And then he told them how Curdie broke his window by breaking a stone  in the street with his hammer.
  There the baker struck in.
    'Now that was the stone,' said he, 'over which I had fallen three times  within the last month: could it be by fair means he broke that to  pieces at the first blow?  Just to make up my mind on that point I  tried his own hammer against a stone in the gate; it nearly broke both  my arms, and loosened half the teeth in my head!'            Derba and Barbara    Meantime the wanderers were hospitably entertained by the old woman and  her grandchild and they were all very comfortable and happy together.
  Little Barbara sat upon Curdie's knee, and he told her stories about  the mines and his adventures in them.
  But he never mentioned the king  or the princess, for all that story was hard to believe.
  And he told  her about his mother and father, and how good they were.
  And Derba sat  and listened.
  At last little Barbara fell asleep in Curdie's arms, and  her grandmother carried her to bed.
    It was a poor little house, and Derba gave up her own room to Curdie  because he was honest and talked wisely.
  Curdie saw how it was, and  begged her to allow him to lie on the floor, but she would not hear of  it.
    In the night he was waked by Lina pulling at him.
  As soon as he spoke  to her she ceased, and Curdie, listening, thought he heard someone  trying to get in.
  He rose, took his mattock, and went about the house,  listening and watching; but although he heard noises now at one place  now at another, he could not think what they meant for no one appeared.
  Certainly, considering how she had frightened them all in the day, it  was not likely any one would attack Lina at night.
  By and by the  noises ceased, and Curdie went back to his bed, and slept undisturbed.
    In the morning, however, Derba came to him in great agitation, and said  they had fastened up the door, so that she could not get out.
 Curdie  rose immediately and went with her: they found that not only the door,  but every window in the house was so secured on the outside that it was  impossible to open one of them without using great force.
  Poor Derba  looked anxiously in Curdie's face.
  He broke out laughing.
    'They are much mistaken,' he said, 'if they fancy they could keep Lina  and a miner in any house in Gwyntystorm--even if they built up doors  and windows.
'    With that he shouldered his mattock.
  But Derba begged him not to make  a hole in her house just yet.
  She had plenty for breakfast, she said,  and before it was time for dinner they would know what the people meant  by it.
    And indeed they did.
  For within an hour appeared one of the chief  magistrates of the city, accompanied by a score of soldiers with drawn  swords, and followed by a great multitude of people, requiring the  miner and his brute to yield themselves, the one that he might be tried  for the disturbance he had occasioned and the injury he had committed,  the other that she might be roasted alive for her part in killing two  valuable and harmless animals belonging to worthy citizens.
  The  summons was preceded and followed by flourish of trumpet, and was read  with every formality by the city marshal himself.
    The moment he ended, Lina ran into the little passage, and stood  opposite the door.
    'I surrender,' cried Curdie.
    'Then tie up your brute, and give her here.
'    'No, no,' cried Curdie through the door.
  'I surrender; but I'm not  going to do your hangman's work.
  If you want MY dog, you must take  her.
'    'Then we shall set the house on fire, and burn witch and all.
'    'It will go hard with us but we shall kill a few dozen of you first,'  cried Curdie.
  'We're not the least afraid of you.
'  With that Curdie  turned to Derba, and said:    'Don't be frightened.
  I have a strong feeling that all will be well.
  Surely no trouble will come to you for being good to strangers.
'    'But the poor dog!' said Derba.
    Now Curdie and Lina understood each other more than a little by this  time, and not only had he seen that she understood the proclamation,  but when she looked up at him after it was read, it was with such a  grin, and such a yellow flash, that he saw also she was determined to  take care of herself.
    'The dog will probably give you reason to think a little more of her  ere long,' he answered.
  'But now,' he went on, 'I fear I must hurt  your house a little.
  I have great confidence, however, that I shall be  able to make up to you for it one day.
'    'Never mind the house, if only you can get safe off,' she answered.
 'I  don't think they will hurt this precious lamb,' she added, clasping  little Barbara to her bosom.
  'For myself, it is all one; I am ready  for anything.
'    'It is but a little hole for Lina I want to make,' said Curdie.
 'She  can creep through a much smaller one than you would think.
'    Again he took his mattock, and went to the back wall.
    'They won't burn the house,' he said to himself.
  'There is too good a  one on each side of it.
'    The tumult had kept increasing every moment, and the city marshal had  been shouting, but Curdie had not listened to him.
  When now they heard  the blows of his mattock, there went up a great cry, and the people  taunted the soldiers that they were afraid of a dog and his miner.
  The  soldiers therefore made a rush at the door, and cut its fastenings.
    The moment they opened it, out leaped Lina, with a roar so unnaturally  horrible that the sword arms of the soldiers dropped by their sides,  paralysed with the terror of that cry; the crowd fled in every  direction, shrieking and yelling with mortal dismay; and without even  knocking down with her tail, not to say biting a man of them with her  pulverizing jaws, Lina vanished--no one knew whither, for not one of  the crowd had had courage to look upon her.
    The moment she was gone, Curdie advanced and gave himself up.
  The  soldiers were so filled with fear, shame, and chagrin, that they were  ready to kill him on the spot.
  But he stood quietly facing them, with  his mattock on his shoulder; and the magistrate wishing to examine him,  and the people to see him made an example of, the soldiers had to  content themselves with taking him.
  Partly for derision, partly to  hurt him, they laid his mattock against his back, and tied his arms to  it.
    They led him up a very steep street, and up another still, all the  crowd following.
  The king's palace-castle rose towering above them;  but they stopped before they reached it, at a low-browed door in a  great, dull, heavy-looking building.
    The city marshal opened it with a key which hung at his girdle, and  ordered Curdie to enter.
  The place within was dark as night, and while  he was feeling his way with his feet, the marshal gave him a rough  push.
  He fell, and rolled once or twice over, unable to help himself  because his hands were tied behind him.
    It was the hour of the magistrate's second and more important  breakfast, and until that was over he never found himself capable of  attending to a case with concentration sufficient to the distinguishing  of the side upon which his own advantage lay; and hence was this  respite for Curdie, with time to collect his thoughts.
  But indeed he  had very few to collect, for all he had to do, so far as he could see,  was to wait for what would come next.
 Neither had he much power to  collect them, for he was a good deal shaken.
    In a few minutes he discovered, to his great relief, that, from the  projection of the pick end of his mattock beyond his body, the fall had  loosened the ropes tied round it.
  He got one hand disengaged, and then  the other; and presently stood free, with his good mattock once more in  right serviceable relation to his arms and legs.
            The Mattock    While The magistrate reinvigorated his selfishness with a greedy  breakfast, Curdie found doing nothing in the dark rather tiresome work.
  It was useless attempting to think what he should do next, seeing the  circumstances in which he was presently to find himself were altogether  unknown to him.
  So he began to think about his father and mother in  their little cottage home, high in the clear air of the open  Mountainside, and the thought, instead of making his dungeon gloomier  by the contrast, made a light in his soul that destroyed the power of  darkness and captivity.
    But he was at length startled from his waking dream by a swell in the  noise outside.
  All the time there had been a few of the more idle of  the inhabitants about the door, but they had been rather quiet.
  Now,  however, the sounds of feet and voices began to grow, and grew so  rapidly that it was plain a multitude was gathering.
 For the people of  Gwyntystorm always gave themselves an hour of pleasure after their  second breakfast, and what greater pleasure could they have than to see  a stranger abused by the officers of justice?    The noise grew till it was like the roaring of the sea, and that  roaring went on a long time, for the magistrate, being a great man,  liked to know that he was waited for: it added to the enjoyment of his  breakfast, and, indeed, enabled him to eat a little more after he had  thought his powers exhausted.
    But at length, in the waves of the human noises rose a bigger wave, and  by the running and shouting and outcry, Curdie learned that the  magistrate was approaching.
    Presently came the sound of the great rusty key in the lock, which  yielded with groaning reluctance; the door was thrown back, the light  rushed in, and with it came the voice of the city marshal, calling upon  Curdie, by many legal epithets opprobrious, to come forth and be tried  for his life, inasmuch as he had raised a tumult in His Majesty's city  of Gwyntystorm, troubled the hearts of the king's baker and barber, and  slain the faithful dogs of His Majesty's well-beloved butchers.
    He was still reading, and Curdie was still seated in the brown twilight  of the vault, not listening, but pondering with himself how this king  the city marshal talked of could be the same with the Majesty he had  seen ride away on his grand white horse with the Princess Irene on a  cushion before him, when a scream of agonized terror arose on the  farthest skirt of the crowd, and, swifter than flood or flame, the  horror spread shrieking.
  In a moment the air was filled with hideous  howling, cries of unspeakable dismay, and the multitudinous noise of  running feet.
  The next moment, in at the door of the vault bounded  Lina, her two green eyes flaming yellow as sunflowers, and seeming to  light up the dungeon.
  With one spring she threw herself at Curdie's  feet, and laid her head upon them panting.
  Then came a rush of two or  three soldiers darkening the doorway, but it was only to lay hold of  the key, pull the door to, and lock it; so that once more Curdie and  Lina were prisoners together.
    For a few moments Lina lay panting hard: it is breathless work leaping  and roaring both at once, and that in a way to scatter thousands of  people.
  Then she jumped up, and began snuffing about all over the  place; and Curdie saw what he had never seen before--two faint spots of  light cast from her eyes upon the ground, one on each side of her  snuffing nose.
  He got out his tinder box--a miner is never without  one--and lighted a precious bit of candle he carried in a division of  it just for a moment, for he must not waste it.
    The light revealed a vault without any window or other opening than the  door.
  It was very old and much neglected.
  The mortar had vanished  from between the stones, and it was half filled with a heap of all  sorts of rubbish, beaten down in the middle, but looser at the sides;  it sloped from the door to the foot of the opposite wall: evidently for  a long time the vault had been left open, and every sort of refuse  thrown into it.
  A single minute served for the survey, so little was  there to note.
    Meantime, down in the angle between the back wall and the base of the  heap Lina was scratching furiously with all the eighteen great strong  claws of her mighty feet.
    'Ah, ha!' said Curdie to himself, catching sight of her, 'if only they  will leave us long enough to ourselves!'    With that he ran to the door, to see if there was any fastening on the  inside.
  There was none: in all its long history it never had had one.
  But a few blows of the right sort, now from the one, now from the other  end of his mattock, were as good as any bolt, for they so ruined the  lock that no key could ever turn in it again.
 Those who heard them  fancied he was trying to get out, and laughed spitefully.
  As soon as  he had done, he extinguished his candle, and went down to Lina.
    She had reached the hard rock which formed the floor of the dungeon,  and was now clearing away the earth a little wider.
 Presently she  looked up in his face and whined, as much as to say, 'My paws are not  hard enough to get any farther.
'    'Then get out of my way, Lina,' said Curdie, and mind you keep your  eyes shining, for fear I should hit you.
'    So saying, he heaved his mattock, and assailed with the hammer end of  it the spot she had cleared.
    The rock was very hard, but when it did break it broke in good-sized  pieces.
  Now with hammer, now with pick, he worked till he was weary,  then rested, and then set to again.
  He could not tell how the day  went, as he had no light but the lamping of Lina's eyes.
  The darkness  hampered him greatly, for he would not let Lina come close enough to  give him all the light she could, lest he should strike her.
  So he  had, every now and then, to feel with his hands to know how he was  getting on, and to discover in what direction to strike: the exact spot  was a mere imagination.
    He was getting very tired and hungry, and beginning to lose heart a  little, when out of the ground, as if he had struck a spring of it,  burst a dull, gleamy, lead-coloured light, and the next moment he heard  a hollow splash and echo.
  A piece of rock had fallen out of the floor,  and dropped into water beneath.
  Already Lina, who had been lying a few  yards off all the time he worked, was on her feet and peering through  the hole.
  Curdie got down on his hands and knees, and looked.
  They  were over what seemed a natural cave in the rock, to which apparently  the river had access, for, at a great distance below, a faint light was  gleaming upon water.
  If they could but reach it, they might get out;  but even if it was deep enough, the height was very dangerous.
  The  first thing, whatever might follow, was to make the hole larger.
  It  was comparatively easy to break away the sides of it, and in the course  of another hour he had it large enough to get through.
    And now he must reconnoitre.
  He took the rope they had tied him  with--for Curdie's hindrances were always his furtherance--and fastened  one end of it by a slipknot round the handle of his pickaxes then  dropped the other end through, and laid the pickaxe so that, when he  was through himself, and hanging on the edge, he could place it across  the hole to support him on the rope.
  This done, he took the rope in  his hands, and, beginning to descend, found himself in a narrow cleft  widening into a cave.
  His rope was not very long, and would not do  much to lessen the force of his fall--he thought to himself--if he  should have to drop into the water; but he was not more than a couple  of yards below the dungeon when he spied an opening on the opposite  side of the cleft: it might be but a shadow hole, or it might lead them  out.
  He dropped himself a little below its level, gave the rope a  swing by pushing his feet against the side of the cleft, and so  penduled himself into it.
  Then he laid a stone on the end of the rope  that it should not forsake him, called to Lina, whose yellow eyes were  gleaming over the mattock grating above, to watch there till he  returned, and went cautiously in.
  It proved a passage, level for some  distance, then sloping gently up.
  He advanced carefully, feeling his  way as he went.
  At length he was stopped by a door--a small door,  studded with iron.
  But the wood was in places so much decayed that  some of the bolts had dropped out, and he felt sure of being able to  open it.
  He returned, therefore, to fetch Lina and his mattock.
  Arrived at the cleft, his strong miner arms bore him swiftly up along  the rope and through the hole into the dungeon.
  There he undid the  rope from his mattock, and making Lina take the end of it in her teeth,  and get through the hole, he lowered her--it was all he could do, she  was so heavy.
  When she came opposite the passage, with a slight push  of her tail she shot herself into it, and let go the rope, which Curdie  drew up.
    Then he lighted his candle and searching in the rubbish found a bit of  iron to take the place of his pickaxe across the hole.
  Then he  searched again in the rubbish, and found half an old shutter.
  This he  propped up leaning a little over the hole, with a bit of stick, and  heaped against the back of it a quantity of the loosened earth.
 Next he  tied his mattock to the end of the rope, dropped it, and let it hang.
  Last, he got through the hole himself, and pulled away the propping  stick, so that the shutter fell over the hole with a quantity of earth  on the top of it.
  A few motions of hand over hand, and he swung  himself and his mattock into the passage beside Lina.
    There he secured the end of the rope, and they went on together to the  door.
            The Wine Cellar    He lighted his candle and examined it.
  Decayed and broken as it was,  it was strongly secured in its place by hinges on the one side, and  either lock or bolt, he could not tell which, on the other.
  A brief  use of his pocket-knife was enough to make room for his hand and arm to  get through, and then he found a great iron bolt--but so rusty that he  could not move it.
    Lina whimpered.
  He took his knife again, made the hole bigger, and  stood back.
  In she shot her small head and long neck, seized the bolt  with her teeth, and dragged it, grating and complaining, back.
 A push  then opened the door.
  It was at the foot of a short flight of steps.
  They ascended, and at the top Curdie found himself in a space which,  from the echo to his stamp, appeared of some size, though of what sort  he could not at first tell, for his hands, feeling about, came upon  nothing.
  Presently, however, they fell on a great thing: it was a wine  cask.
    He was just setting out to explore the place thoroughly, when he heard  steps coming down a stair.
  He stood still, not knowing whether the  door would open an inch from his nose or twenty yards behind his back.
  It did neither.
  He heard the key turn in the lock, and a stream of  light shot in, ruining the darkness, about fifteen yards away on his  right.
    A man carrying a candle in one hand and a large silver flagon in the  other, entered, and came toward him.
  The light revealed a row of huge  wine casks, that stretched away into the darkness of the other end of  the long vault.
  Curdie retreated into the recess of the stair, and  peeping round the corner of it, watched him, thinking what he could do  to prevent him from locking them in.
  He came on and on, until curdie  feared he would pass the recess and see them.
  He was just preparing to  rush out, and master him before he should give alarm, not in the least  knowing what he should do next, when, to his relief, the man stopped at  the third cask from where he stood.
  He set down his light on the top  of it, removed what seemed a large vent-peg, and poured into the cask a  quantity of something from the flagon.
  Then he turned to the next  cask, drew some wine, rinsed the flagon, threw the wine away, drew and  rinsed and threw away again, then drew and drank, draining to the  bottom.
  Last of all, he filled the flagon from the cask he had first  visited, replaced then the vent-peg, took up his candle, and turned  toward the door.
    'There is something wrong here!' thought Curdie.
    'Speak to him, Lina,' he whispered.
    The sudden howl she gave made Curdie himself start and tremble for a  moment.
  As to the man, he answered Lina's with another horrible howl,  forced from him by the convulsive shudder of every muscle of his body,  then reeled gasping to and fro, and dropped his candle.
 But just as  Curdie expected to see him fall dead he recovered himself, and flew to  the door, through which he darted, leaving it open behind him.
  The  moment he ran, Curdie stepped out, picked up the candle still alight,  sped after him to the door, drew out the key, and then returned to the  stair and waited.
  In a few minutes he heard the sound of many feet and  voices.
  Instantly he turned the tap of the cask from which the man had  been drinking, set the candle beside it on the floor, went down the  steps and out of the little door, followed by Lina, and closed it  behind them.
    Through the hole in it he could see a little, and hear all.
  He could  see how the light of many candles filled the place, and could hear how  some two dozen feet ran hither and thither through the echoing cellar;  he could hear the clash of iron, probably spits and pokers, now and  then; and at last heard how, finding nothing remarkable except the best  wine running to waste, they all turned on the butler and accused him of  having fooled them with a drunken dream.
  He did his best to defend  himself, appealing to the evidence of their own senses that he was as  sober as they were.
 They replied that a fright was no less a fright  that the cause was imaginary, and a dream no less a dream that the  fright had waked him from it.
    When he discovered, and triumphantly adduced as corroboration, that the  key was gone from the door, they said it merely showed how drunk he had  been--either that or how frightened, for he had certainly dropped it.
  In vain he protested that he had never taken it out of the lock--that  he never did when he went in, and certainly had not this time stopped  to do so when he came out; they asked him why he had to go to the  cellar at such a time of the day, and said it was because he had  already drunk all the wine that was left from dinner.
  He said if he  had dropped the key, the key was to be found, and they must help him to  find it.
  They told him they wouldn't move a peg for him.
  He declared,  with much language, he would have them all turned out of the king's  service.
  They said they would swear he was drunk.
    And so positive were they about it, that at last the butler himself  began to think whether it was possible they could be in the right.
 For  he knew that sometimes when he had been drunk he fancied things had  taken place which he found afterward could not have happened.
 Certain  of his fellow servants, however, had all the time a doubt whether the  cellar goblin had not appeared to him, or at least roared at him, to  protect the wine.
  In any case nobody wanted to find the key for him;  nothing could please them better than that the door of the wine cellar  should never more be locked.
  By degrees the hubbub died away, and they  departed, not even pulling to the door, for there was neither handle  nor latch to it.
    As soon as they were gone, Curdie returned, knowing now that they were  in the wine cellar of the palace, as indeed, he had suspected.
 Finding  a pool of wine in a hollow of the floor, Lina lapped it up eagerly: she  had had no breakfast, and was now very thirsty as well as hungry.
  Her  master was in a similar plight, for he had but just begun to eat when  the magistrate arrived with the soldiers.
  If only they were all in  bed, he thought, that he might find his way to the larder!  For he said  to himself that, as he was sent there by the young princess's  great-great-grandmother to serve her or her father in some way, surely  he must have a right to his food in the Palace, without which he could  do nothing.
  He would go at once and reconnoitre.
    So he crept up the stair that led from the cellar.
  At the top was a  door, opening on a long passage dimly lighted by a lamp.
  He told Lina  to lie down upon the stair while he went on.
  At the end of the passage  he found a door ajar, and, peering through, saw right into a great  stone hall, where a huge fire was blazing, and through which men in the  king's livery were constantly coming and going.
 Some also in the same  livery were lounging about the fire.
  He noted that their colours were  the same as those he himself, as king's miner, wore; but from what he  had seen and heard of the habits of the place, he could not hope they  would treat him the better for that.
    The one interesting thing at the moment, however, was the plentiful  supper with which the table was spread.
  It was something at least to  stand in sight of food, and he was unwilling to turn his back on the  prospect so long as a share in it was not absolutely hopeless.
 Peeping  thus, he soon made UP his mind that if at any moment the hall should be  empty, he would at that moment rush in and attempt to carry off a dish.
  That he might lose no time by indecision, he selected a large pie upon  which to pounce instantaneously.
  But after he had watched for some  minutes, it did not seem at all likely the chance would arrive before  suppertime, and he was just about to turn away and rejoin Lina, when he  saw that there was not a person in the place.
  Curdie never made up his  mind and then hesitated.
  He darted in, seized the pie, and bore it  swiftly and noiselessly to the cellar stair.
            The King's Kitchen    Back to the cellar Curdie and Lina sped with their booty, where, seated  on the steps, Curdie lighted his bit of candle for a moment.
 A very  little bit it was now, but they did not waste much of it in examination  of the pie; that they effected by a more summary process.
  Curdie  thought it the nicest food he had ever tasted, and between them they  soon ate it up.
  Then Curdie would have thrown the dish along with the  bones into the water, that there might be no traces of them; but he  thought of his mother, and hid it instead; and the very next minute  they wanted it to draw some wine into.
  He was careful it should be  from the cask of which he had seen the butler drink.
    Then they sat down again upon the steps, and waited until the house  should be quiet.
  For he was there to do something, and if it did not  come to him in the cellar, he must go to meet it in other places.
  Therefore, lest he should fall asleep, he set the end of the helve of  his mattock on the ground, and seated himself on the cross part,  leaning against the wall, so that as long as he kept awake he should  rest, but the moment he began to fall asleep he must fall awake  instead.
  He quite expected some of the servants would visit the cellar  again that night, but whether it was that they were afraid of each  other, or believed more of the butler's story than they had chosen to  allow, not one of them appeared.
    When at length he thought he might venture, he shouldered his mattock  and crept up the stair.
  The lamp was out in the passage, but he could  not miss his way to the servants' hall.
  Trusting to Lina's quickness  in concealing herself, he took her with him.
    When they reached the hall they found it quiet and nearly dark.
 The  last of the great fire was glowing red, but giving little light.
  Curdie stood and warmed himself for a few moments: miner as he was, he  had found the cellar cold to sit in doing nothing; and standing thus he  thought of looking if there were any bits of candle about.
  There were  many candlesticks on the supper table, but to his disappointment and  indignation their candles seemed to have been all left to burn out, and  some of them, indeed, he found still hot in the neck.
    Presently, one after another, he came upon seven men fast asleep, most  of them upon tables, one in a chair, and one on the floor.
 They seemed,  from their shape and colour, to have eaten and drunk so much that they  might be burned alive without wakening.
  He grasped the hand of each in  succession, and found two ox hoofs, three pig hoofs, one concerning  which he could not be sure whether it was the hoof of a donkey or a  pony, and one dog's paw.
  'A nice set of people to be about a king!'  thought Curdie to himself, and turned again to his candle hunt.
  He did  at last find two or three little pieces, and stowed them away in his  pockets.
  They now left the hall by another door, and entered a short  passage, which led them to the huge kitchen, vaulted and black with  smoke.
  There, too, the fire was still burning, so that he was able to  see a little of the state of things in this quarter also.
    The place was dirty and disorderly.
  In a recess, on a heap of  brushwood, lay a kitchen-maid, with a table cover around her, and a  skillet in her hand: evidently she too had been drinking.
  In another  corner lay a page, and Curdie noted how like his dress was to his own.
  In the cinders before the hearth were huddled three dogs and five cats,  all fast asleep, while the rats were running about the floor.
  Curdie's  heart ached to think of the lovely child-princess living over such a  sty.
  The mine was a paradise to a palace with such servants in it.
    Leaving the kitchen, he got into the region of the sculleries.
 There  horrible smells were wandering about, like evil spirits that come forth  with the darkness.
  He lighted a candle--but only to see ugly sights.
  Everywhere was filth and disorder.
  Mangy turnspit dogs were lying  about, and grey rats were gnawing at refuse in the sinks.
  It was like  a hideous dream.
  He felt as if he should never get out of it, and  longed for one glimpse of his mother's poor little kitchen, so clean  and bright and airy.
 Turning from it at last in miserable disgust, he  almost ran back through the kitchen, re-entered the hall, and crossed  it to another door.
    It opened upon a wider passage leading to an arch in a stately  corridor, all its length lighted by lamps in niches.
  At the end of it  was a large and beautiful hall, with great pillars.
  There sat three  men in the royal livery, fast asleep, each in a great armchair, with  his feet on a huge footstool.
  They looked like fools dreaming  themselves kings; and Lina looked as if she longed to throttle them.
  At one side of the hall was the grand staircase, and they went up.
    Everything that now met Curdie's eyes was rich--not glorious like the  splendours of the mountain cavern, but rich and soft--except where, now  and then, some rough old rib of the ancient fortress came through, hard  and discoloured.
  Now some dark bare arch of stone, now some rugged and  blackened pillar, now some huge beam, brown with the smoke and dust of  centuries, looked like a thistle in the midst of daisies, or a rock in  a smooth lawn.
    They wandered about a good while, again and again finding themselves  where they had been before.
  Gradually, however, Curdie was gaining  some idea of the place.
  By and by Lina began to look frightened, and  as they went on Curdie saw that she looked more and more frightened.
  Now, by this time he had come to understand that what made her look  frightened was always the fear of frightening, and he therefore  concluded they must be drawing nigh to somebody.
    At last, in a gorgeously painted gallery, he saw a curtain of crimson,  and on the curtain a royal crown wrought in silks and stones.
  He felt  sure this must be the king's chamber, and it was here he was wanted;  or, if it was not the place he was bound for, something would meet him  and turn him aside; for he had come to think that so long as a man  wants to do right he may go where he can: when he can go no farther,  then it is not the way.
  'Only,' said his father, in assenting to the  theory, 'he must really want to do right, and not merely fancy he does.
  He must want it with his heart and will, and not with his rag of a  tongue.
'    So he gently lifted the corner of the curtain, and there behind it was  a half-open door.
  He entered, and the moment he was in, Lina stretched  herself along the threshold between the curtain and the door.
            The King's Chamber    He found himself in a large room, dimly lighted by a silver lamp that  hung from the ceiling.
  Far at the other end was a great bed,  surrounded with dark heavy curtains.
  He went softly toward it, his  heart beating fast.
  It was a dreadful thing to be alone in the king's  chamber at the dead of night.
  To gain courage he had to remind himself  of the beautiful princess who had sent him.
    But when he was about halfway to the bed, a figure appeared from the  farther side of it, and came towards him, with a hand raised warningly.
  He stood still.
  The light was dim, and he could distinguish little  more than the outline of a young girl.
  But though the form he saw was  much taller than the princess he remembered, he never doubted it was  she.
  For one thing, he knew that most girls would have been frightened  to see him there in the dead of the night, but like a true princess,  and the princess he used to know, she walked straight on to meet him.
  As she came she lowered the hand she had lifted, and laid the  forefinger of it upon her lips.
  Nearer and nearer, quite near, close  up to him she came, then stopped, and stood a moment looking at him.
    'You are Curdie,' she said.
    'And you are the Princess Irene,' he returned.
    'Then we know each other still,' she said, with a sad smile of  pleasure.
  'You will help me.
'    'That I will,' answered Curdie.
  He did not say, 'If I can'; for he  knew that what he was sent to do, that he could do.
  'May I kiss your  hand, little Princess?'    She was only between nine and ten, though indeed she looked several  years older, and her eyes almost those of a grown woman, for she had  had terrible trouble of late.
    She held out her hand.
    'I am not the little princess any more.
  I have grown up since I saw  you last, Mr Miner.
'    The smile which accompanied the words had in it a strange mixture of  playfulness and sadness.
    'So I see, Miss Princess,' returned Curdie; 'and therefore, being more  of a princess, you are the more my princess.
  Here I am, sent by your  great-great-grandmother, to be your servant.
  May I ask why you are up  so late, Princess?'    'Because my father wakes so frightened, and I don't know what he would  do if he didn't find me by his bedside.
  There! he's waking now.
'    She darted off to the side of the bed she had come from.
    Curdie stood where he was.
    A voice altogether unlike what he remembered of the mighty, noble king  on his white horse came from the bed, thin, feeble, hollow, and husky,  and in tone like that of a petulant child:    'I will not, I will not.
  I am a king, and I will be a king.
  I hate  you and despise you, and you shall not torture me!'    'Never mind them, Father dear,' said the princess.
  'I am here, and  they shan't touch you.
  They dare not, you know, so long as you defy  them.
'    'They want my crown, darling; and I can't give them my crown, can I?  For what is a king without his crown?'    'They shall never have your crown, my king,' said Irene.
  'Here it  is--all safe.
  I am watching it for you.
'    Curdie drew near the bed on the other side.
  There lay the grand old  king--he looked grand still, and twenty years older.
  His body was  pillowed high; his beard descended long and white over the crimson  coverlid; and his crown, its diamonds and emeralds gleaming in the  twilight of the curtains, lay in front of him, his long thin old hands  folded round it, and the ends of his beard straying among the lovely  stones.
  His face was like that of a man who had died fighting nobly;  but one thing made it dreadful: his eyes, while they moved about as if  searching in this direction and in that, looked more dead than his  face.
  He saw neither his daughter nor his crown: it was the voice of  the one and the touch of the other that comforted him.
  He kept  murmuring what seemed words, but was unintelligible to Curdie,  although, to judge from the look of Irene's face, she learned and  concluded from it.
    By degrees his voice sank away and the murmuring ceased, although still  his lips moved.
  Thus lay the old king on his bed, slumbering with his  crown between his hands; on one side of him stood a lovely little  maiden, with blue eyes, and brown hair going a little back from her  temples, as if blown by a wind that no one felt but herself; and on the  other a stalwart young miner, with his mattock over his shoulder.
  Stranger sight still was Lina lying along the threshold--only nobody  saw her just then.
    A moment more and the king's lips ceased to move.
  His breathing had  grown regular and quiet.
  The princess gave a sigh of relief, and came  round to Curdie.
    'We can talk a little now,' she said, leading him toward the middle of  the room.
  'My father will sleep now till the doctor wakes him to give  him his medicine.
  It is not really medicine, though, but wine.
  Nothing but that, the doctor says, could have kept him so long alive.
  He always comes in the middle of the night to give it him with his own  hands.
  But it makes me cry to see him wake up when so nicely asleep.
'    'What sort of man is your doctor?' asked Curdie.
    'Oh, such a dear, good, kind gentleman!' replied the princess.
  'He  speaks so softly, and is so sorry for his dear king!  He will be here  presently, and you shall see for yourself.
  You will like him very  much.
'    'Has your king-father been long ill?' asked Curdie.
    'A whole year now,' she replied.
  'Did you not know?  That's how your  mother never got the red petticoat my father promised her.
 The lord  chancellor told me that not only Gwyntystorm but the whole land was  mourning over the illness of the good man.
'    Now Curdie himself had not heard a word of His Majesty's illness, and  had no ground for believing that a single soul in any place he had  visited on his journey had heard of it.
  Moreover, although mention had  been made of His Majesty again and again in his hearing since he came  to Gwyntystorm, never once had he heard an allusion to the state of his  health.
  And now it dawned upon him also that he had never heard the  least expression of love to him.
  But just for the time he thought it  better to say nothing on either point.
    'Does the king wander like this every night?' he asked.
    'Every night,' answered Irene, shaking her head mournfully.
  'That is  why I never go to bed at night.
  He is better during the day--a little,  and then I sleep--in the dressing room there, to be with him in a  moment if he should call me.
  It is so sad he should have only me and  not my mamma!  A princess is nothing to a queen!'    'I wish he would like me,' said Curdie, 'for then I might watch by him  at night, and let you go to bed, Princess.
'    'Don't you know then?' returned Irene, in wonder.
  'How was it you  came?  Ah!  You said my grandmother sent you.
  But I thought you knew  that he wanted you.
'    And again she opened wide her blue stars.
    'Not I,' said Curdie, also bewildered, but very glad.
    'He used to be constantly saying--he was not so ill then as he is  now--that he wished he had you about him.
'    'And I never to know it!' said Curdie, with displeasure.
    'The master of the horse told papa's own secretary that he had written  to the miner-general to find you and send you up; but the miner-general  wrote back to the master of the horse, and he told the secretary, and  the secretary told my father, that they had searched every mine in the  kingdom and could hear nothing of you.
 My father gave a great sigh, and  said he feared the goblins had got you, after all, and your father and  mother were dead of grief.
  And he has never mentioned you since,  except when wandering.
  I cried very much.
  But one of my grandmother's  pigeons with its white wing flashed a message to me through the window  one day, and then I knew that my Curdie wasn't eaten by the goblins,  for my grandmother wouldn't have taken care of him one time to let him  be eaten the next.
  Where were you, Curdie, that they couldn't find  you?'    'We will talk about that another time, when we are not expecting the  doctor,' said Curdie.
    As he spoke, his eyes fell upon something shining on the table under  the lamp.
  His heart gave a great throb, and he went nearer.
 Yes, there  could be no doubt--it was the same flagon that the butler had filled in  the wine cellar.
    'It looks worse and worse!'he said to himself, and went back to Irene,  where she stood half dreaming.
    'When will the doctor be here?' he asked once more--this time hurriedly.
    The question was answered--not by the princess, but by something which  that instant tumbled heavily into the room.
  Curdie flew toward it in  vague terror about Lina.
    On the floor lay a little round man, puffing and blowing, and uttering  incoherent language.
  Curdie thought of his mattock, and ran and laid  it aside.
    'Oh, dear Dr Kelman!' cried the princess, running up and taking hold of  his arm; 'I am so sorry!'  She pulled and pulled, but might almost as  well have tried to set up a cannon ball.
  'I hope you have not hurt  yourself?'    'Not at all, not at all,' said the doctor, trying to smile and to rise  both at once, but finding it impossible to do either.
    'If he slept on the floor he would be late for breakfast,' said Curdie  to himself, and held out his hand to help him.
    But when he took hold of it, Curdie very nearly let him fall again, for  what he held was not even a foot: it was the belly of a creeping thing.
  He managed, however, to hold both his peace and his grasp, and pulled  the doctor roughly on his legs--such as they were.
    'Your Royal Highness has rather a thick mat at the door,' said the  doctor, patting his palms together.
  'I hope my awkwardness may not  have startled His Majesty.
'    While he talked Curdie went to the door: Lina was not there.
    The doctor approached the bed.
    'And how has my beloved king slept tonight?' he asked.
    'No better,' answered Irene, with a mournful shake of her head.
    'Ah, that is very well!' returned the doctor, his fall seeming to have  muddled either his words or his meaning.
  'When we give him his wine,  he will be better still.
'    Curdie darted at the flagon, and lifted it high, as if he had expected  to find it full, but had found it empty.
    'That stupid butler!  I heard them say he was drunk!' he cried in a  loud whisper, and was gliding from the room.
    'Come here with that flagon, you!  Page!' cried the doctor.
 Curdie came  a few steps toward him with the flagon dangling from his hand, heedless  of the gushes that fell noiseless on the thick carpet.
    'Are you aware, young man,' said the doctor, 'that it is not every wine  can do His Majesty the benefit I intend he should derive from my  prescription?'    'Quite aware, sir, answered Curdie.
  'The wine for His Majesty's use is  in the third cask from the corner.
'    'Fly, then,' said the doctor, looking satisfied.
    Curdie stopped outside the curtain and blew an audible breath--no more;  up came Lina noiseless as a shadow.
  He showed her the flagon.
    'The cellar, Lina: go,' he said.
    She galloped away on her soft feet, and Curdie had indeed to fly to  keep up with her.
  Not once did she make even a dubious turn.
  From the  king's gorgeous chamber to the cold cellar they shot.
  Curdie dashed  the wine down the back stair, rinsed the flagon out as he had seen the  butler do, filled it from the cask of which he had seen the butler  drink, and hastened with it up again to the king's room.
    The little doctor took it, poured out a full glass, smelt, but did not  taste it, and set it down.
  Then he leaned over the bed, shouted in the  king's ear, blew upon his eyes, and pinched his arm: Curdie thought he  saw him run something bright into it.
  At last the king half woke.
  The  doctor seized the glass, raised his head, poured the wine down his  throat, and let his head fall back on the pillow again.
  Tenderly  wiping his beard, and bidding the princess good night in paternal  tones, he then took his leave.
  Curdie would gladly have driven his  pick into his head, but that was not in his commission, and he let him  go.
  The little round man looked very carefully to his feet as he  crossed the threshold.
    'That attentive fellow of a page has removed the mat,' he said to  himself, as he walked along the corridor.
  'I must remember him.
'            Counterplotting    Curdie was already sufficiently enlightened as to how things were  going, to see that he must have the princess of one mind with him, and  they must work together.
  It was clear that among those about the king  there was a plot against him: for one thing, they had agreed in a lie  concerning himself; and it was plain also that the doctor was working  out a design against the health and reason of His Majesty, rendering  the question of his life a matter of little moment.
  It was in itself  sufficient to justify the worst fears, that the people outside the  palace were ignorant of His Majesty's condition: he believed those  inside it also--the butler excepted--were ignorant of it as well.
  Doubtless His Majesty's councillors desired to alienate the hearts of  his subjects from their sovereign.
  Curdie's idea was that they  intended to kill the king, marry the princess to one of themselves, and  found a new dynasty; but whatever their purpose, there was treason in  the palace of the worst sort: they were making and keeping the king  incapable, in order to effect that purpose.
  The first thing to be seen  to, therefore, was that His Majesty should neither eat morsel nor drink  drop of anything prepared for him in the palace.
  Could this have been  managed without the princess, Curdie would have preferred leaving her  in ignorance of the horrors from which he sought to deliver her.
  He  feared also the danger of her knowledge betraying itself to the evil  eyes about her; but it must be risked and she had always been a wise  child.
    Another thing was clear to him--that with such traitors no terms of  honour were either binding or possible, and that, short of lying, he  might use any means to foil them.
  And he could not doubt that the old  princess had sent him expressly to frustrate their plans.
    While he stood thinking thus with himself, the princess was earnestly  watching the king, with looks of childish love and womanly tenderness  that went to Curdie's heart.
  Now and then with a great fan of peacock  feathers she would fan him very softly; now and then, seeing a cloud  begin to gather upon the sky of his sleeping face, she would climb upon  the bed, and bending to his ear whisper into it, then draw back and  watch again--generally to see the cloud disperse.
  In his deepest  slumber, the soul of the king lay open to the voice of his child, and  that voice had power either to change the aspect of his visions, or,  which was better still, to breathe hope into his heart, and courage to  endure them.
    Curdie came near, and softly called her.
    'I can't leave Papa just yet,' she returned, in a low voice.
    'I will wait,' said Curdie; 'but I want very much to say something.
'    In a few minutes she came to him where he stood under the lamp.
    'Well, Curdie, what is it?' she said.
    'Princess,' he replied, 'I want to tell you that I have found why your  grandmother sent me.
'    'Come this way, then, she answered, 'where I can see the face of my  king.
'    Curdie placed a chair for her in the spot she chose, where she would be  near enough to mark any slightest change on her father's countenance,  yet where their low-voiced talk would not disturb him.
 There he sat  down beside her and told her all the story--how her grandmother had  sent her good pigeon for him, and how she had instructed him, and sent  him there without telling him what he had to do.
  Then he told her what  he had discovered of the state of things generally in Gwyntystorm, and  especially what he had heard and seen in the palace that night.
    'Things are in a bad state enough,' he said in conclusion--'lying and  selfishness and inhospitality and dishonesty everywhere; and to crown  all, they speak with disrespect of the good king, and not a man knows  he is ill.
'    'You frighten me dreadfully,' said Irene, trembling.
    'You must be brave for your king's sake,' said Curdie.
    'Indeed I will,' she replied, and turned a long loving look upon the  beautiful face of her father.
  'But what is to be done?  And how am I  to believe such horrible things of Dr Kelman?'    'My dear Princess,' replied Curdie, 'you know nothing of him but his  face and his tongue, and they are both false.
  Either you must beware  of him, or you must doubt your grandmother and me; for I tell you, by  the gift she gave me of testing hands, that this man is a snake.
  That  round body he shows is but the case of a serpent.
 Perhaps the creature  lies there, as in its nest, coiled round and round inside.
'    'Horrible!' said Irene.
    'Horrible indeed; but we must not try to get rid of horrible things by  refusing to look at them, and saying they are not there.
  Is not your  beautiful father sleeping better since he had the wine?'    'Yes.
'    'Does he always sleep better after having it?'    She reflected an instant.
    'No; always worse--till tonight,' she answered.
    'Then remember that was the wine I got him--not what the butler drew.
  Nothing that passes through any hand in the house except yours or mine  must henceforth, till he is well, reach His Majesty's lips.
'    'But how, dear Curdie?' said the princess, almost crying.
    'That we must contrive,' answered Curdie.
  'I know how to take care of  the wine; but for his food--now we must think.
'    'He takes hardly any,' said the princess, with a pathetic shake of her  little head which Curdie had almost learned to look for.
    'The more need,' he replied, 'there should be no poison in it.
' Irene  shuddered.
  'As soon as he has honest food he will begin to grow  better.
  And you must be just as careful with yourself, Princess,'  Curdie went on, 'for you don't know when they may begin to poison you,  too.
'    'There's no fear of me; don't talk about me,' said Irene.
  'The good  food!  How are we to get it, Curdie?  That is the whole question.
'    'I am thinking hard,' answered Curdie.
  'The good food?  Let me  see--let me see!  Such servants as I saw below are sure to have the  best of everything for themselves: I will go an see what I can find on  their table.
'    'The chancellor sleeps in the house, and he and the master of the  king's horse always have their supper together in a room off the great  hall, to the right as you go down the stairs,' said Irene.
 'I would go  with you, but I dare not leave my father.
  Alas!  He scarcely ever  takes more than a mouthful.
  I can't think how he lives!  And the very  thing he would like, and often asks for--a bit of bread--I can hardly  ever get for him: Dr Kelman has forbidden it, and says it is nothing  less than poison to him.
'    'Bread at least he shall have,' said Curdie; 'and that, with the honest  wine, will do as well as anything, I do believe.
  I will go at once and  look for some.
  But I want you to see Lina first, and know her, lest,  coming upon her by accident at any time, you should be frightened.
'    'I should like much to see her,' said the princess.
    Warning her not to be startled by her ugliness, he went to the door and  called her.
    She entered, creeping with downcast head, and dragging her tail over  the floor behind her.
  Curdie watched the princess as the frightful  creature came nearer and nearer.
  One shudder went from head to foot,  and next instant she stepped to meet her.
  Lina dropped flat on the  floor, and covered her face with her two big paws.
  It went to the  heart of the princess: in a moment she was on her knees beside her,  stroking her ugly head, and patting her all over.
    'Good dog!  Dear ugly dog!' she said.
    Lina whimpered.
    'I believe,' said Curdie, 'from what your grandmother told me, that  Lina is a woman, and that she was naughty, but is now growing good.
'    Lina had lifted her head while Irene was caressing her; now she dropped  it again between her paws; but the princess took it in her hands, and  kissed the forehead betwixt the gold-green eyes.
    'Shall I take her with me or leave her?' asked Curdie.
    'Leave her, poor dear,' said Irene, and Curdie, knowing the way now,  went without her.
    He took his way first to the room the princess had spoken of, and there  also were the remains of supper; but neither there nor in the kitchen  could he find a scrap of plain wholesome-looking bread.
  So he returned  and told her that as soon as it was light he would go into the city for  some, and asked her for a handkerchief to tie it in.
  If he could not  bring it himself, he would send it by Lina, who could keep out of sight  better than he, and as soon as all was quiet at night he would come to  her again.
  He also asked her to tell the king that he was in the  house.
  His hope lay in the fact that bakers everywhere go to work  early.
  But it was yet much too early.
  So he persuaded the princess to  lie down, promising to call her if the king should stir.
            The Loaf    His Majesty slept very quietly.
  The dawn had grown almost day, and  still Curdie lingered, unwilling to disturb the princess.
    At last, however, he called her, and she was in the room in a moment.
  She had slept, she said, and felt quite fresh.
  Delighted to find her  father still asleep, and so peacefully, she pushed her chair close to  the bed, and sat down with her hands in her lap.
    Curdie got his mattock from where he had hidden it behind a great  mirror, and went to the cellar, followed by Lina.
  They took some  breakfast with them as they passed through the hall, and as soon as  they had eaten it went out the back way.
    At the mouth of the passage Curdie seized the rope, drew himself up,  pushed away the shutter, and entered the dungeon.
  Then he swung the  end of the rope to Lina, and she caught it in her teeth.
 When her  master said, 'Now, Lina!' she gave a great spring, and he ran away with  the end of the rope as fast as ever he could.
  And such a spring had  she made, that by the time he had to bear her weight she was within a  few feet of the hole.
  The instant she got a paw through, she was all  through.
    Apparently their enemies were waiting till hunger should have cowed  them, for there was no sign of any attempt having been made to open the  door.
  A blow or two of Curdie's mattock drove the shattered lock clean  from it, and telling Lina to wait there till he came back, and let no  one in, he walked out into the silent street, and drew the door to  behind them.
  He could hardly believe it was not yet a whole day since  he had been thrown in there with his hands tied at his back.
    Down the town he went, walking in the middle of the street, that, if  any one saw him, he might see he was not afraid, and hesitate to rouse  an attack on him.
  As to the dogs, ever since the death of their two  companions, a shadow that looked like a mattock was enough to make them  scamper.
  As soon as he reached the archway of the city gate he turned  to reconnoitre the baker's shop, and perceiving no sign of movement,  waited there watching for the first.
    After about an hour, the door opened, and the baker's man appeared with  a pail in his hand.
  He went to a pump that stood in the street, and  having filled his pail returned with it into the shop.
 Curdie stole  after him, found the door on the latch, opened it very gently, peeped  in, saw nobody, and entered.
  Remembering perfectly from what shelf the  baker's wife had taken the loaf she said was the best, and seeing just  one upon it, he seized it, laid the price of it on the counter, and  sped softly out, and up the street.
  Once more in the dungeon beside  Lina, his first thought was to fasten up the door again, which would  have been easy, so many iron fragments of all sorts and sizes lay  about; but he bethought himself that if he left it as it was, and they  came to find him, they would conclude at once that they had made their  escape by it, and would look no farther so as to discover the hole.
  He  therefore merely pushed the door close and left it.
  Then once more  carefully arranging the earth behind the shutter, so that it should  again fall with it, he returned to the cellar.
    And now he had to convey the loaf to the princess.
  If he could venture  to take it himself, well; if not, he would send Lina.
  He crept to the  door of the servants' hall, and found the sleepers beginning to stir.
  One said it was time to go to bed; another, that he would go to the  cellar instead, and have a mug of wine to waken him up; while a third  challenged a fourth to give him his revenge at some game or other.
    'Oh, hang your losses!' answered his companion; 'you'll soon pick up  twice as much about the house, if you but keep your eyes open.
'    Perceiving there would be risk in attempting to pass through, and  reflecting that the porters in the great hall would probably be awake  also, Curdie went back to the cellar, took Irene's handkerchief with  the loaf in it, tied it round Lina's neck, and told her to take it to  the princess.
    Using every shadow and every shelter, Lina slid through the servants  like a shapeless terror through a guilty mind, and so, by corridor and  great hall, up the stair to the king's chamber.
    Irene trembled a little when she saw her glide soundless in across the  silent dusk of the morning, that filtered through the heavy drapery of  the windows, but she recovered herself at once when she saw the bundle  about her neck, for it both assured her of Curdie's safety, and gave  her hope of her father's.
  She untied it with joy, and Lina stole away,  silent as she had come.
  Her joy was the greater that the king had  waked up a little before, and expressed a desire for food--not that he  felt exactly hungry, he said, and yet he wanted something.
  If only he  might have a piece of nice fresh bread!  Irene had no knife, but with  eager hands she broke a great piece from the loaf, and poured out a  full glass of wine.
 The king ate and drank, enjoyed the bread and the  wine much, and instantly fell asleep again.
    It was hours before the lazy people brought their breakfast.
  When it  came, Irene crumbled a little about, threw some into the fireplace, and  managed to make the tray look just as usual.
    In the meantime, down below in the cellar, Curdie was lying in the  hollow between the upper sides of two of the great casks, the warmest  place he could find.
  Lina was watching.
  She lay at his feet, across  the two casks, and did her best so to arrange her huge tail that it  should be a warm coverlid for her master.
    By and by Dr Kelman called to see his patient; and now that Irene's  eyes were opened, she saw clearly enough that he was both annoyed and  puzzled at finding His Majesty rather better.
  He pretended however to  congratulate him, saying he believed he was quite fit to see the lord  chamberlain: he wanted his signature to something important; only he  must not strain his mind to understand it, whatever it might be: if His  Majesty did, he would not be answerable for the consequences.
  The king  said he would see the lord chamberlain, and the doctor went.
    Then Irene gave him more bread and wine, and the king ate and drank,  and smiled a feeble smile, the first real one she had seen for many a  day.
  He said he felt much better, and would soon be able to take  matters into his own hands again.
  He had a strange miserable feeling,  he said, that things were going terribly wrong, although he could not  tell how.
  Then the princess told him that Curdie had come, and that at  night, when all was quiet for nobody in the palace must know, he would  pay His Majesty a visit.
  Her great-great-grandmother had sent him, she  said.
  The king looked strangely upon her, but the strange look passed  into a smile clearer than the first, and irene's heart throbbed with  delight.
            The Lord Chamberlain    At noon the lord chamberlain appeared.
  With a long, low bow, and paper  in hand, he stepped softly into the room.
  Greeting His Majesty with  every appearance of the profoundest respect, and congratulating him on  the evident progress he had made, he declared himself sorry to trouble  him, but there were certain papers, he said, which required his  signature--and therewith drew nearer to the king, who lay looking at  him doubtfully.
  He was a lean, long, yellow man, with a small head,  bald over the top, and tufted at the back and about the ears.
  He had a  very thin, prominent, hooked nose, and a quantity of loose skin under  his chin and about the throat, which came craning up out of his  neckcloth.
  His eyes were very small, sharp, and glittering, and looked  black as jet.
  He had hardly enough of a mouth to make a smile with.
  His left hand held the paper, and the long, skinny fingers of his right  a pen just dipped in ink.
    But the king, who for weeks had scarcely known what he did, was today  so much himself as to be aware that he was not quite himself; and the  moment he saw the paper, he resolved that he would not sign without  understanding and approving of it.
  He requested the lord chamberlain  therefore to read it.
  His Lordship commenced at once but the  difficulties he seemed to encounter, and the fits of stammering that  seized him, roused the king's suspicion tenfold.
 He called the princess.
    'I trouble His Lordship too much,' he said to her: 'you can read print  well, my child--let me hear how you can read writing.
  Take that paper  from His Lordship's hand, and read it to me from beginning to end,  while my lord drinks a glass of my favourite wine, and watches for your  blunders.
'    'Pardon me, Your Majesty,' said the lord chamberlain, with as much of a  smile as he was able to extemporize, 'but it were a thousand pities to  put the attainments of Her Royal Highness to a test altogether too  severe.
  Your Majesty can scarcely with justice expect the very organs  of her speech to prove capable of compassing words so long, and to her  so unintelligible.
'    'I think much of my little princess and her capabilities,' returned the  king, more and more aroused.
  'Pray, my lord, permit her to try.
'    'Consider, Your Majesty: the thing would be altogether without  precedent.
  It would be to make sport of statecraft,' said the lord  chamberlain.
    'Perhaps you are right, my lord,' answered the king, with more meaning  than he intended should be manifest, while to his growing joy he felt  new life and power throbbing in heart and brain.
  'So this morning we  shall read no further.
  I am indeed ill able for business of such  weight.
'    'Will Your Majesty please sign your royal name here?' said the lord  chamberlain, preferring the request as a matter of course, and  approaching with the feather end of the pen pointed to a spot where  there was a great red seal.
    'Not today, my lord,' replied the king.
    'It is of the greatest importance, Your Majesty,' softly insisted the  other.
    'I descried no such importance in it,' said the king.
    'Your Majesty heard but a part.
'    'And I can hear no more today.
'    'I trust Your Majesty has ground enough, in a case of necessity like  the present, to sign upon the representation of his loyal subject and  chamberlain?  Or shall I call the lord chancellor?' he added, rising.
    'There is no need.
  I have the very highest opinion of your judgement,  my lord,' answered the king; 'that is, with respect to means: we might  differ as to ends.
'    The lord chamberlain made yet further attempts at persuasion; but they  grew feebler and feebler, and he was at last compelled to retire  without having gained his object.
  And well might his annoyance be  keen!  For that paper was the king's will, drawn up by the  attorney-general; nor until they had the king's signature to it was  there much use in venturing farther.
  But his worst sense of  discomfiture arose from finding the king with so much capacity left,  for the doctor had pledged himself so to weaken his brain that he  should be as a child in their hands, incapable of refusing anything  requested of him: His Lordship began to doubt the doctor's fidelity to  the conspiracy.
    The princess was in high delight.
  She had not for weeks heard so many  words, not to say words of such strength and reason, from her father's  lips: day by day he had been growing weaker and more lethargic.
  He was  so much exhausted, however, after this effort, that he asked for  another piece of bread and more wine, and fell fast asleep the moment  he had taken them.
    The lord chamberlain sent in a rage for Dr Kelman.
  He came, and while  professing himself unable to understand the symptoms described by His  Lordship, yet pledged himself again that on the morrow the king should  do whatever was required of him.
    The day went on.
  When His Majesty was awake, the princess read to  him--one storybook after another; and whatever she read, the king  listened as if he had never heard anything so good before, making out  in it the wisest meanings.
  Every now and then he asked for a piece of  bread and a little wine, and every time he ate and drank he slept, and  every time he woke he seemed better than the last time.
  The princess  bearing her part, the loaf was eaten up and the flagon emptied before  night.
  The butler took the flagon away, and brought it back filled to  the brim, but both were thirsty and hungry when Curdie came again.
    Meantime he and Lina, watching and waking alternately, had plenty of  sleep.
  In the afternoon, peeping from the recess, they saw several of  the servants enter hurriedly, one after the other, draw wine, drink it,  and steal out; but their business was to take care of the king, not of  his cellar, and they let them drink.
  Also, when the butler came to  fill the flagon, they restrained themselves, for the villain's fate was  not yet ready for him.
  He looked terribly frightened, and had brought  with him a large candle and a small terrier--which latter indeed  threatened to be troublesome, for he went roving and sniffing about  until he came to the recess where they were.
  But as soon as he showed  himself, Lina opened her jaws so wide, and glared at him so horribly,  that, without even uttering a whimper, he tucked his tail between his  legs and ran to his master.
  He was drawing the wicked wine at the  moment, and did not see him, else he would doubtless have run too.
    When suppertime approached, Curdie took his place at the door into the  servants' hall; but after a long hour's vain watch, he began to fear he  should get nothing: there was so much idling about, as well as coming  and going.
  It was hard to bear--chiefly from the attractions of a  splendid loaf, just fresh out of the oven, which he longed to secure  for the king and princess.
  At length his chance did arrive: he pounced  upon the loaf and carried it away, and soon after got hold of a pie.
    This time, however, both loaf and pie were missed.
  The cook was  called.
  He declared he had provided both.
  One of themselves, he said,  must have carried them away for some friend outside the palace.
  Then a  housemaid, who had not long been one of them, said she had seen someone  like a page running in the direction of the cellar with something in  his hands.
  Instantly all turned upon the pages, accusing them, one  after another.
  All denied, but nobody believed one of them: Where  there is no truth there can be no faith.
    To the cellar they all set out to look for the missing pie and loaf.
  Lina heard them coming, as well she might, for they were talking and  quarrelling loud, and gave her master warning.
  They snatched up  everything, and got all signs of their presence out at the back door  before the servants entered.
  When they found nothing, they all turned  on the chambermaid, and accused her, not only of lying against the  pages, but of having taken the things herself.
  Their language and  behaviour so disgusted Curdie, who could hear a great part of what  passed, and he saw the danger of discovery now so much increased, that  he began to devise how best at once to rid the palace of the whole pack  of them.
  That, however, would be small gain so long as the treacherous  officers of state continued in it.
  They must be first dealt with.
  A  thought came to him, and the longer he looked at it the better he liked  it.
    As soon as the servants were gone, quarrelling and accusing all the  way, they returned and finished their supper.
  Then Curdie, who had  long been satisfied that Lina understood almost every word he said,  communicated his plan to her, and knew by the wagging of her tail and  the flashing of her eyes that she comprehended it.
  Until they had the  king safe through the worst part of the night, however, nothing could  be done.
    They had now merely to go on waiting where they were till the household  should be asleep.
  This waiting and waiting was much the hardest thing  Curdie had to do in the whole affair.
  He took his mattock and, going  again into the long passage, lighted a candle end and proceeded to  examine the rock on all sides.
  But this was not merely to pass the  time: he had a reason for it.
  When he broke the stone in the street,  over which the baker fell, its appearance led him to pocket a fragment  for further examination; and since then he had satisfied himself that  it was the kind of stone in which gold is found, and that the yellow  particles in it were pure metal.
  If such stone existed here in any  plenty, he could soon make the king rich and independent of his  ill-conditioned subjects.
 He was therefore now bent on an examination  of the rock; nor had he been at it long before he was persuaded that  there were large quantities of gold in the half-crystalline white  stone, with its veins of opaque white and of green, of which the rock,  so far as he had been able to inspect it, seemed almost entirely to  consist.
 Every piece he broke was spotted with particles and little  lumps of a lovely greenish yellow--and that was gold.
  Hitherto he had  worked only in silver, but he had read, and heard talk, and knew,  therefore, about gold.
  As soon as he had got the king free of rogues  and villains, he would have all the best and most honest miners, with  his father at the head of them, to work this rock for the king.
    It was a great delight to him to use his mattock once more.
  The time  went quickly, and when he left the passage to go to the king's chamber,  he had already a good heap of fragments behind the broken door.
            Dr Kelman    As soon as he had reason to hope the way was clear, Curdie ventured  softly into the hall, with Lina behind him.
  There was no one asleep on  the bench or floor, but by the fading fire sat a girl weeping.
  It was  the same who had seen him carrying off the food, and had been so hardly  used for saying so.
  She opened her eyes when he appeared, but did not  seem frightened at him.
    'I know why you weep,' said Curdie, 'and I am sorry for you.
'    'It is hard not to be believed just because one speaks the truth,' said  the girl, 'but that seems reason enough with some people.
  My mother  taught me to speak the truth, and took such pains with me that I should  find it hard to tell a lie, though I could invent many a story these  servants would believe at once; for the truth is a strange thing here,  and they don't know it when they see it.
 Show it them, and they all  stare as if it were a wicked lie, and that with the lie yet warm that  has just left their own mouths! You are a stranger,' she said, and  burst out weeping afresh, 'but the stranger you are to such a place and  such people the better!'    'I am the person,' said Curdie, whom you saw carrying the things from  the supper table.
'  He showed her the loaf.
  'If you can trust, as well  as speak the truth, I will trust you.
  Can you trust me?'    She looked at him steadily for a moment.
    'I can,' she answered.
    'One thing more,' said Curdie: 'have you courage as well as truth?'    'I think so.
'    'Look my dog in the face and don't cry out.
  Come here, Lina.
'    Lina obeyed.
  The girl looked at her, and laid her hand on Lina's head.
    'Now I know you are a true woman,' said curdie.
  'I am come to set  things right in this house.
  Not one of the servants knows I am here.
  Will you tell them tomorrow morning that, if they do not alter their  ways, and give over drinking, and lying, and stealing, and unkindness,  they shall every one of them be driven from the palace?'    'They will not believe me.
'    'Most likely; but will you give them the chance?'    'I will.
'    'Then I will be your friend.
  Wait here till I come again.
'    She looked him once more in the face, and sat down.
    When he reached the royal chamber, he found His Majesty awake, and very  anxiously expecting him.
  He received him with the utmost kindness, and  at once, as it were, put himself in his hands by telling him all he  knew concerning the state he was in.
  His voice was feeble, but his eye  was clear, although now and then his words and thoughts seemed to  wander.
  Curdie could not be certain that the cause of their not being  intelligible to him did not lie in himself.
  The king told him that for  some years, ever since his queen's death, he had been losing heart over  the wickedness of his people.
  He had tried hard to make them good, but  they got worse and worse.
  Evil teachers, unknown to him, had crept  into the schools; there was a general decay of truth and right  principle at least in the city; and as that set the example to the  nation, it must spread.
    The main cause of his illness was the despondency with which the  degeneration of his people affected him.
  He could not sleep, and had  terrible dreams; while, to his unspeakable shame and distress, he  doubted almost everybody.
  He had striven against his suspicion, but in  vain, and his heart was sore, for his courtiers and councillors were  really kind; only he could not think why none of their ladies came near  his princess.
  The whole country was discontented, he heard, and there  were signs of gathering storm outside as well as inside his borders.
  The master of the horse gave him sad news of the insubordination of the  army; and his great white horse was dead, they told him; and his sword  had lost its temper: it bent double the last time he tried it!--only  perhaps that was in a dream; and they could not find his shield; and  one of his spurs had lost the rowel.
    Thus the poor king went wandering in a maze of sorrows, some of which  were purely imaginary, while others were truer than he understood.
  He  told how thieves came at night and tried to take his crown, so that he  never dared let it out of his hands even when he slept; and how, every  night, an evil demon in the shape of his physician came and poured  poison down his throat.
  He knew it to be poison, he said, somehow,  although it tasted like wine.
    Here he stopped, faint with the unusual exertion of talking.
    Curdie seized the flagon, and ran to the wine cellar.
    In the servants' hall the girl still sat by the fire, waiting for him.
  As he returned he told her to follow him, and left her at the chamber  door until he should rejoin her.
  When the king had had a little wine,  he informed him that he had already discovered certain of His Majesty's  enemies, and one of the worst of them was the doctor, for it was no  other demon than the doctor himself who had been coming every night,  and giving him a slow poison.
    'So!' said the king.
  'Then I have not been suspicious enough, for I  thought it was but a dream!  Is it possible Kelman can be such a  wretch?  Who then am I to trust?'    'Not one in the house, except the princess and myself,' said Curdie.
    'I will not go to sleep,' said the king.
    'That would be as bad as taking the poison,' said Curdie.
  'No, no,  sire; you must show your confidence by leaving all the watching to me,  and doing all the sleeping Your Majesty can.
'    The king smiled a contented smile, turned on his side, and was  presently fast asleep.
  Then Curdie persuaded the princess also to go  to sleep, and telling Lina to watch, went to the housemaid.
  He asked  her if she could inform him which of the council slept in the palace,  and show him their rooms.
  She knew every one of them, she said, and  took him the round of all their doors, telling him which slept in each  room.
  He then dismissed her, and returning to the king's chamber,  seated himself behind a curtain at the head of the bed, on the side  farthest from the king.
  He told Lina to get under the bed, and make no  noise.
    About one o'clock the doctor came stealing in.
  He looked round for the  princess, and seeing no one, smiled with satisfaction as he approached  the wine where it stood under the lamp.
  Having partly filled a glass,  he took from his pocket a small phial, and filled up the glass from it.
  The light fell upon his face from above, and Curdie saw the snake in it  plainly visible.
  He had never beheld such an evil countenance: the man  hated the king, and delighted in doing him wrong.
    With the glass in his hand, he drew near the bed, set it down, and  began his usual rude rousing of His Majesty.
  Not at once succeeding,  he took a lancet from his pocket, and was parting its cover with an  involuntary hiss of hate between his closed teeth, when Curdie stooped  and whispered to Lina.
    'Take him by the leg, Lina.
'  She darted noiselessly upon him.
 With a  face of horrible consternation, he gave his leg one tug to free it; the  next instant Curdie heard the one scrunch with which she crushed the  bone like a stick of celery.
  He tumbled on the floor with a yell.
    'Drag him out, Lina,' said Curdie.
 Lina took him by the collar, and  dragged him out.
  Her master followed her to direct her, and they left  the doctor lying across the lord chamberlain's door, where he gave  another horrible yell, and fainted.
    The king had waked at his first cry, and by the time Curdie re-entered  he had got at his sword where it hung from the centre of the tester,  had drawn it, and was trying to get out of bed.
  But when Curdie told  him all was well, he lay down again as quietly as a child comforted by  his mother from a troubled dream.
  Curdie went to the door to watch.
    The doctor's yells had aroused many, but not one had yet ventured to  appear.
  Bells were rung violently, but none were answered; and in a  minute or two Curdie had what he was watching for.
  The door of the  lord chamberlain's room opened, and, pale with hideous terror, His  Lordship peeped out.
  Seeing no one, he advanced to step into the  corridor, and tumbled over the doctor.
  Curdie ran up, and held out his  hand.
  He received in it the claw of a bird of prey--vulture or eagle,  he could not tell which.
    His Lordship, as soon as he was on his legs, taking him for one of the  pages abused him heartily for not coming sooner, and threatened him  with dismissal from the king's service for cowardice and neglect.
  He  began indeed what bade fair to be a sermon on the duties of a page, but  catching sight of the man who lay at his door, and seeing it was the  doctor, he fell upon Curdie afresh for standing there doing nothing,  and ordered him to fetch immediate assistance.
  Curdie left him, but  slipped into the King's chamber, closed and locked the door, and left  the rascals to look after each other.
  Ere long he heard hurrying  footsteps, and for a few minutes there was a great muffled tumult of  scuffling feet, low voices and deep groanings; then all was still again.
    Irene slept through the whole--so confidently did she rest, knowing  Curdie was in her father's room watching over him.
            The Prophecy    Curdie sat and watched every motion of the sleeping king.
  All the  night, to his ear, the palace lay as quiet as a nursery of healthful  children.
  At sunrise he called the princess.
    'How has His Majesty slept?' were her first words as she entered the  room.
    'Quite quietly,' answered Curdie; 'that is, since the doctor was got  rid of.
'    'How did you manage that?' inquired Irene; and Curdie had to tell all  about it.
    'How terrible!' she said.
  'Did it not startle the king dreadfully?'    'It did rather.
  I found him getting out of bed, sword in hand.
'    'The brave old man!' cried the princess.
    'Not so old!' said Curdie, 'as you will soon see.
  He went off again in  a minute or so; but for a little while he was restless, and once when  he lifted his hand it came down on the spikes of his crown, and he half  waked.
'    'But where is the crown?' cried Irene, in sudden terror.
    'I stroked his hands,' answered Curdie, 'and took the crown from them;  and ever since he has slept quietly, and again and again smiled in his  sleep.
'    'I have never seen him do that,' said the princess.
  'But what have you  done with the crown, Curdie?'    'Look,' said Curdie, moving away from the bedside.
    Irene followed him--and there, in the middle of the floor, she saw a  strange sight.
  Lina lay at full length, fast asleep, her tail  stretched out straight behind her and her forelegs before her: between  the two paws meeting in front of it, her nose just touching it behind,  glowed and flashed the crown, like a nest of the humming birds of  heaven.
    Irene gazed, and looked up with a smile.
    'But what if the thief were to come, and she not to wake?' she said.
  'Shall I try her?'  And as she spoke she stooped toward the crown.
    'No, no, no!' cried Curdie, terrified.
  'She would frighten you out of  your wits.
  I would do it to show you, but she would wake your father.
  You have no conception with what a roar she would spring at my throat.
  But you shall see how lightly she wakes the moment I speak to her.
  Lina!'    She was on her feet the same instant, with her great tail sticking out  straight behind her, just as it had been lying.
    'Good dog!' said the princess, and patted her head.
  Lina wagged her  tail solemnly, like the boom of an anchored sloop.
  Irene took the  crown, and laid it where the king would see it when he woke.
    'Now, Princess,' said Curdie, 'I must leave you for a few minutes.
 You  must bolt the door, please, and not open it to any one.
'    Away to the cellar he went with Lina, taking care, as they passed  through the servants' hall, to get her a good breakfast.
  In about one  minute she had eaten what he gave her, and looked up in his face: it  was not more she wanted, but work.
  So out of the cellar they went  through the passage, and Curdie into the dungeon, where he pulled up  Lina, opened the door, let her out, and shut it again behind her.
  As  he reached the door of the king's chamber, Lina was flying out of the  gate of Gwyntystorm as fast as her mighty legs could carry her.
    'What's come to the wench?' growled the menservants one to another,  when the chambermaid appeared among them the next morning.
  There was  something in her face which they could not understand, and did not like.
    'Are we all dirt?' they said.
  'What are you thinking about?  Have you  seen yourself in the glass this morning, miss?'    She made no answer.
    'Do you want to be treated as you deserve, or will you speak, you  hussy?' said the first woman-cook.
  'I would fain know what right you  have to put on a face like that!'    'You won't believe me,' said the girl.
    'Of course not.
  What is it?'    'I must tell you, whether you believe me or not,' she said.
    'Of course you must.
'    'It is this, then: if you do not repent of your bad ways, you are all  going to be punished--all turned out of the palace together.
'    'A mighty punishment!' said the butler.
  'A good riddance, say I, of  the trouble of keeping minxes like you in order!  And why, pray, should  we be turned out?  What have I to repent of now, your holiness?'    'That you know best yourself,' said the girl.
    'A pretty piece of insolence!  How should I know, forsooth, what a  menial like you has got against me!  There are people in this  house--oh! I'm not blind to their ways!--but every one for himself, say  I!  Pray, Miss judgement, who gave you such an impertinent message to  His Majesty's household?'    'One who is come to set things right in the king's house.
'    'Right, indeed!' cried the butler; but that moment the thought came  back to him of the roar he had heard in the cellar, and he turned pale  and was silent.
    The steward took it up next.
    'And pray, pretty prophetess,' he said, attempting to chuck her under  the chin, 'what have I got to repent of?'    'That you know best yourself,' said the girl.
  'You have but to look  into your books or your heart.
'    'Can you tell me, then, what I have to repent of?' said the groom of  the chambers.
  'That you know best yourself,' said the girl once more.
  'The person who told me to tell you said the servants of this house had  to repent of thieving, and lying, and unkindness, and drinking; and  they will be made to repent of them one way, if they don't do it of  themselves another.
'    Then arose a great hubbub; for by this time all the servants in the  house were gathered about her, and all talked together, in towering  indignation.
    'Thieving, indeed!' cried one.
  'A pretty word in a house where  everything is left lying about in a shameless way, tempting poor  innocent girls!  A house where nobody cares for anything, or has the  least respect to the value of property!'    'I suppose you envy me this brooch of mine,' said another.
  'There was  just a half sheet of note paper about it, not a scrap more, in a drawer  that's always open in the writing table in the study! What sort of a  place is that for a jewel?  Can you call it stealing to take a thing  from such a place as that?  Nobody cared a straw about it.
  It might as  well have been in the dust hole!  If it had been locked up--then, to be  sure!'    'Drinking!' said the chief porter, with a husky laugh.
  'And who  wouldn't drink when he had a chance?  Or who would repent it, except  that the drink was gone?  Tell me that, Miss Innocence.
'    'Lying!' said a great, coarse footman.
  'I suppose you mean when I told  you yesterday you were a pretty girl when you didn't pout? Lying,  indeed!  Tell us something worth repenting of!  Lying is the way of  Gwyntystorm.
  You should have heard Jabez lying to the cook last night!  He wanted a sweetbread for his pup, and pretended it was for the  princess!  Ha! ha! ha!'    'Unkindness!  I wonder who's unkind!  Going and listening to any  stranger against her fellow servants, and then bringing back his wicked  words to trouble them!' said the oldest and worst of the housemaids.
  'One of ourselves, too!  Come, you hypocrite!  This is all an invention  of yours and your young man's, to take your revenge of us because we  found you out in a lie last night.
  Tell true now: wasn't it the same  that stole the loaf and the pie that sent you with the impudent  message?'    As she said this, she stepped up to the housemaid and gave her, instead  of time to answer, a box on the ear that almost threw her down; and  whoever could get at her began to push and bustle and pinch and punch  her.
    'You invite your fate,' she said quietly.
    They fell furiously upon her, drove her from the hall with kicks and  blows, hustled her along the passage, and threw her down the stair to  the wine cellar, then locked the door at the top of it, and went back  to their breakfast.
    In the meantime the king and the princess had had their bread and wine,  and the princess, with Curdie's help, had made the room as tidy as she  could--they were terribly neglected by the servants.
 And now Curdie set  himself to interest and amuse the king, and prevent him from thinking  too much, in order that he might the sooner think the better.
  Presently, at His Majesty's request, he began from the beginning, and  told everything he could recall of his life, about his father and  mother and their cottage on the mountain, of the inside of the mountain  and the work there, about the goblins and his adventures with them.
    When he came to finding the princess and her nurse overtaken by the  twilight on the mountain, Irene took up her share of the tale, and told  all about herself to that point, and then Curdie took it up again; and  so they went on, each fitting in the part that the other did not know,  thus keeping the hoop of the story running straight; and the king  listened with wondering and delighted ears, astonished to find what he  could so ill comprehend, yet fitting so well together from the lips of  two narrators.
    At last, with the mission given him by the wonderful princess and his  consequent adventures, Curdie brought up the whole tale to the present  moment.
  Then a silence fell, and Irene and Curdie thought the king was  asleep.
  But he was far from it; he was thinking about many things.
  After a long pause he said:    'Now at last, MY children, I am compelled to believe many things I  could not and do not yet understand--things I used to hear, and  sometimes see, as often as I visited my mother's home.
  Once, for  instance, I heard my mother say to her father--speaking of me--"He is a  good, honest boy, but he will be an old man before he understands"; and  my grandfather answered, "Keep up your heart, child: my mother will  look after him.
"  I thought often of their words, and the many strange  things besides I both heard and saw in that house; but by degrees,  because I could not understand them, I gave up thinking of them.
  And  indeed I had almost forgotten them, when you, my child, talking that  day about the Queen Irene and her pigeons, and what you had seen in her  garret, brought them all back to my mind in a vague mass.
  But now they  keep coming back to me, one by one, every one for itself; and I shall  just hold my peace, and lie here quite still, and think about them all  till I get well again.
'    What he meant they could not quite understand, but they saw plainly  that already he was better.
    'Put away my crown,' he said.
  'I am tired of seeing it, and have no  more any fear of its safety.
'  They put it away together, withdrew from  the bedside, and left him in peace.
            The Avengers    There was nothing now to be dreaded from Dr Kelman, but it made Curdie  anxious, as the evening drew near, to think that not a soul belonging  to the court had been to visit the king, or ask how he did, that day.
  He feared, in some shape or other, a more determined assault.
  He had  provided himself a place in the room, to which he might retreat upon  approach, and whence he could watch; but not once had he had to betake  himself to it.
    Towards night the king fell asleep.
  Curdie thought more and more  uneasily of the moment when he must again leave them for a little  while.
  Deeper and deeper fell the shadows.
  No one came to light the  lamp.
  The princess drew her chair close to Curdie: she would rather it  were not so dark, she said.
  She was afraid of something--she could not  tell what; nor could she give any reason for her fear but that all was  so dreadfully still.
    When it had been dark about an hour, Curdie thought Lina might have  returned; and reflected that the sooner he went the less danger was  there of any assault while he was away.
  There was more risk of his own  presence being discovered, no doubt, but things were now drawing to a  crisis, and it must be run.
  So, telling the princess to lock all the  doors of the bedchamber, and let no one in, he took his mattock, and  with here a run, and there a halt under cover, gained the door at the  head of the cellar stair in safety.
  To his surprise he found it  locked, and the key was gone.
  There was no time for deliberation.
  He  felt where the lock was, and dealt it a tremendous blow with his  mattock.
  It needed but a second to dash the door open.
  Someone laid a  hand on his arm.
    'Who is it?' said Curdie.
    'I told you they wouldn't believe me, sir,' said the housemaid.
  'I  have been here all day.
'    He took her hand, and said, 'You are a good, brave girl.
  Now come with  me, lest your enemies imprison you again.
'    He took her to the cellar, locked the door, lighted a bit of candle,  gave her a little wine, told her to wait there till he came, and went  out the back way.
    Swiftly he swung himself up into the dungeon.
  Lina had done her part.
  The place was swarming with creatures--animal forms wilder and more  grotesque than ever ramped in nightmare dream.
  Close by the hole,  waiting his coming, her green eyes piercing the gulf below, Lina had  but just laid herself down when he appeared.
  All about the vault and  up the slope of the rubbish heap lay and stood and squatted the  forty-nine whose friendship Lina had conquered in the wood.
  They all  came crowding about Curdie.
    He must get them into the cellar as quickly as ever he could.
  But when  he looked at the size of some of them, he feared it would be a long  business to enlarge the hole sufficiently to let them through.
  At it  he rushed, hitting vigorously at the edge with his mattock.
  At the  very first blow came a splash from the water beneath, but ere he could  heave a third, a creature like a tapir, only that the grasping point of  its proboscis was hard as the steel of Curdie's hammer, pushed him  gently aside, making room for another creature, with a head like a  great club, which it began banging upon the floor with terrible force  and noise.
  After about a minute of this battery, the tapir came up  again, shoved Clubhead aside, and putting its own head into the hole  began gnawing at the sides of it with the finger of its nose, in such a  fashion that the fragments fell in a continuous gravelly shower into  the water.
  In a few minutes the opening was large enough for the  biggest creature among them to get through it.
    Next came the difficulty of letting them down: some were quite light,  but the half of them were too heavy for the rope, not to say for his  arms.
  The creatures themselves seemed to be puzzling where or how they  were to go.
  One after another of them came up, looked down through the  hole, and drew back.
  Curdie thought if he let Lina down, perhaps that  would suggest something; possibly they did not see the opening on the  other side.
  He did so, and Lina stood lighting up the entrance of the  passage with her gleaming eyes.
    One by one the creatures looked down again, and one by one they drew  back, each standing aside to glance at the next, as if to say, Now you  have a look.
  At last it came to the turn of the serpent with the long  body, the four short legs behind, and the little wings before.
  No  sooner had he poked his head through than he poked it farther  through--and farther, and farther yet, until there was little more than  his legs left in the dungeon.
  By that time he had got his head and  neck well into the passage beside Lina.
  Then his legs gave a great  waddle and spring, and he tumbled himself, far as there was betwixt  them, heels over head into the passage.
    'That is all very well for you, Mr Legserpent!' thought Curdie to  himself; 'but what is to be done with the rest?'  He had hardly time to  think it, however, before the creature's head appeared again through  the floor.
  He caught hold of the bar of iron to which Curdie's rope  was tied, and settling it securely across the narrowest part of the  irregular opening, held fast to it with his teeth.
  It was plain to  Curdie, from the universal hardness among them, that they must all, at  one time or another, have been creatures of the mines.
    He saw at once what this one was after.
  The beast had planted his feet  firmly upon the floor of the passage, and stretched his long body up  and across the chasm to serve as a bridge for the rest.
 Curdie mounted  instantly upon his neck, threw his arms round him as far as they would  go, and slid down in ease and safety, the bridge just bending a little  as his weight glided over it.
  But he thought some of the creatures  would try the legserpent's teeth.
    One by one the oddities followed, and slid down in safety.
  When they  seemed to be all landed, he counted them: there were but forty-eight.
  Up the rope again he went, and found one which had been afraid to trust  himself to the bridge, and no wonder! for he had neither legs nor head  nor arms nor tail: he was just a round thing, about a foot in diameter,  with a nose and mouth and eyes on one side of the ball.
  He had made  his journey by rolling as swiftly as the fleetest of them could run.
  The back of the legserpent not being flat, he could not quite trust  himself to roll straight and not drop into the gulf.
  Curdie took him  in his arms, and the moment he looked down through the hole, the bridge  made itself again, and he slid into the passage in safety, with  Ballbody in his bosom.
    He ran first to the cellar to warn the girl not to be frightened at the  avengers of wickedness.
  Then he called to Lina to bring in her friends.
    One after another they came trooping in, till the cellar seemed full of  them.
  The housemaid regarded them without fear.
    'Sir,' she said, 'there is one of the pages I don't take to be a bad  fellow.
'    'Then keep him near you,' said Curdie.
  'And now can you show me a way  to the king's chamber not through the servants' hall?'    'There is a way through the chamber of the colonel of the guard,' she  answered, 'but he is ill, and in bed.
'    'Take me that way,' said Curdie.
    By many ups and downs and windings and turnings she brought him to a  dimly lighted room, where lay an elderly man asleep.
  His arm was  outside the coverlid, and Curdie gave his hand a hurried grasp as he  went by.
  His heart beat for joy, for he had found a good, honest,  human hand.
    'I suppose that is why he is ill,' he said to himself.
    It was now close upon suppertime, and when the girl stopped at the door  of the king's chamber, he told her to go and give the servants one  warning more.
    'Say the messenger sent you,' he said.
  'I will be with you very soon.
'    The king was still asleep.
  Curdie talked to the princess for a few  minutes, told her not to be frightened whatever noises she heard, only  to keep her door locked till he came, and left her.
            The Vengeance    By the time the girl reached the servants' hall they were seated at  supper.
  A loud, confused exclamation arose when she entered.
  No one  made room for her; all stared with unfriendly eyes.
  A page, who  entered the next minute by another door, came to her side.
    'Where do you come from, hussy?' shouted the butler, and knocked his  fist on the table with a loud clang.
    He had gone to fetch wine, had found the stair door broken open and the  cellar door locked, and had turned and fled.
  Among his fellows,  however, he had now regained what courage could be called his.
    'From the cellar,' she replied.
  'The messenger broke open the door,  and sent me to you again.
'    'The messenger!  Pooh!  What messenger?'    'The same who sent me before to tell you to repent.
'    'What!  Will you go fooling it still?  Haven't you had enough of it?'  cried the butler in a rage, and starting to his feet, drew near  threateningly.
    'I must do as I am told,' said the girl.
    'Then why don't you do as I tell you, and hold your tongue?' said the  butler.
  'Who wants your preachments?  If anybody here has anything to  repent Of, isn't that enough--and more than enough for him--but you  must come bothering about, and stirring up, till not a drop of quiet  will settle inside him?  You come along with me, young woman; we'll see  if we can't find a lock somewhere in the house that'll hold you in!'    'Hands off, Mr Butler!' said the page, and stepped between.
    'Oh, ho!' cried the butler, and pointed his fat finger at him.
 'That's  you, is it, my fine fellow?  So it's you that's up to her tricks, is  it?'    The youth did not answer, only stood with flashing eyes fixed on him,  until, growing angrier and angrier, but not daring a step nearer, he  burst out with a rude but quavering authority:    'Leave the house, both of you!  Be off, or I'll have Mr Steward to talk  to you.
  Threaten your masters, indeed!  Out of the house with you, and  show us the way you tell us of!'    Two or three of the footmen got up and ranged themselves behind the  butler.
    'Don't say I threaten you, Mr Butler,' expostulated the girl from  behind the page.
  'The messenger said I was to tell you again, and give  you one chance more.
'    'Did the messenger mention me in particular?' asked the butler, looking  the page unsteadily in the face.
    'No, sir,' answered the girl.
    'I thought not!  I should like to hear him!'    'Then hear him now,' said Curdie, who that moment entered at the  opposite corner of the hall.
  'I speak of the butler in particular when  I say that I know more evil of him than of any of the rest.
 He will not  let either his own conscience or my messenger speak to him: I therefore  now speak myself.
  I proclaim him a villain, and a traitor to His  Majesty the king.
  But what better is any one of you who cares only for  himself, eats, drinks, takes good money, and gives vile service in  return, stealing and wasting the king's property, and making of the  palace, which ought to be an example of order and sobriety, a disgrace  to the country?'    For a moment all stood astonished into silence by this bold speech from  a stranger.
  True, they saw by his mattock over his shoulder that he  was nothing but a miner boy, yet for a moment the truth told  notwithstanding.
  Then a great roaring laugh burst from the biggest of  the footmen as he came shouldering his way through the crowd toward  Curdie.
    'Yes, I'm right,' he cried; 'I thought as much!  This messenger,  forsooth, is nothing but a gallows bird--a fellow the city marshal was  going to hang, but unfortunately put it off till he should be starved  enough to save rope and be throttled with a pack thread.
 He broke  prison, and here he is preaching!'  As he spoke, he stretched out his  great hand to lay hold of him.
  Curdie caught it in his left hand, and  heaved his mattock with the other.
  Finding, however, nothing worse  than an ox hoof, he restrained himself, stepped back a pace or two,  shifted his mattock to his left hand, and struck him a little smart  blow on the shoulder.
  His arm dropped by his side, he gave a roar, and  drew back.
    His fellows came crowding upon Curdie.
  Some called to the dogs; others  swore; the women screamed; the footmen and pages got round him in a  half circle, which he kept from closing by swinging his mattock, and  here and there threatening a blow.
    'Whoever confesses to having done anything wrong in this house, however  small, however great, and means to do better, let him come to this  corner of the room,' he cried.
    None moved but the page, who went toward him skirting the wall.
 When  they caught sight of him, the crowd broke into a hiss of derision.
    'There!  See!  Look at the sinner!  He confesses!  Actually confesses!  Come, what is it you stole?  The barefaced hypocrite! There's your sort  to set up for reproving other people!  Where's the other now?'    But the maid had left the room, and they let the page pass, for he  looked dangerous to stop.
  Curdie had just put him betwixt him and the  wall, behind the door, when in rushed the butler with the huge kitchen  poker, the point of which he had blown red-hot in the fire, followed by  the cook with his longest spit.
  Through the crowd, which scattered  right and left before them, they came down upon Curdie.
  Uttering a  shrill whistle, he caught the poker a blow with his mattock, knocking  the point to the ground, while the page behind him started forward, and  seizing the point of the spit, held on to it with both hands, the cook  kicking him furiously.
    Ere the butler could raise the poker again, or the cook recover the  spit, with a roar to terrify the dead, Lina dashed into the room, her  eyes flaming like candles.
  She went straight at the butler.
 He was  down in a moment, and she on the top of him, wagging her tail over him  like a lioness.
    'Don't kill him, Lina,' said Curdie.
    'Oh, Mr Miner!' cried the butler.
    'Put your foot on his mouth, Lina,' said Curdie.
  'The truth Fear tells  is not much better than her lies.
'    The rest of the creatures now came stalking, rolling, leaping, gliding,  hobbling into the room, and each as he came took the next place along  the wall, until, solemn and grotesque, all stood ranged, awaiting  orders.
    And now some of the culprits were stealing to the doors nearest them.
  Curdie whispered to the two creatures next him.
  Off went Ballbody,  rolling and bounding through the crowd like a spent cannon shot, and  when the foremost reached the door to the corridor, there he lay at the  foot of it grinning; to the other door scuttled a scorpion, as big as a  huge crab.
  The rest stood so still that some began to think they were  only boys dressed up to look awful; they persuaded themselves they were  only another part of the housemaid's and page's vengeful contrivance,  and their evil spirits began to rise again.
  Meantime Curdie had, with  a second sharp blow from the hammer of his mattock, disabled the cook,  so that he yielded the spit with a groan.
  He now turned to the  avengers.
    'Go at them,' he said.
    The whole nine-and-forty obeyed at once, each for himself, and after  his own fashion.
  A scene of confusion and terror followed.
 The crowd  scattered like a dance of flies.
  The creatures had been instructed not  to hurt much, but to hunt incessantly, until everyone had rushed from  the house.
  The women shrieked, and ran hither and thither through the  hall, pursued each by her own horror, and snapped at by every other in  passing.
  If one threw herself down in hysterical despair, she was  instantly poked or clawed or nibbled up again.
    Though they were quite as frightened at first, the men did not run so  fast; and by and by some of them finding they were only glared at, and  followed, and pushed, began to summon up courage once more, and with  courage came impudence.
  The tapir had the big footman in charge: the  fellow stood stock-still, and let the beast come up to him, then put  out his finger and playfully patted his nose.
  The tapir gave the nose  a little twist, and the finger lay on the floor.
    Then indeed did the footman run.
    Gradually the avengers grew more severe, and the terrors of the  imagination were fast yielding to those of sensuous experience, when a  page, perceiving one of the doors no longer guarded, sprang at it, and  ran out.
  Another and another followed.
  Not a beast went after, until,  one by one, they were every one gone from the hall, and the whole crew  in the kitchen.
    There they were beginning to congratulate themselves that all was over,  when in came the creatures trooping after them, and the second act of  their terror and pain began.
  They were flung about in all directions;  their clothes were torn from them; they were pinched and scratched any-  and everywhere; Ballbody kept rolling up them and over them, confining  his attentions to no one in particular; the scorpion kept grabbing at  their legs with his huge pincers; a three-foot centipede kept screwing  up their bodies, nipping as he went; varied as numerous were their  woes.
  Nor was it long before the last of them had fled from the  kitchen to the sculleries.
    But thither also they were followed, and there again they were hunted  about.
  They were bespattered with the dirt of their own neglect; they  were soused in the stinking water that had boiled greens; they were  smeared with rancid dripping; their faces were rubbed in maggots: I  dare not tell all that was done to them.
  At last they got the door  into a back yard open, and rushed out.
  Then first they knew that the  wind was howling and the rain falling in sheets.
  But there was no rest  for them even there.
  Thither also were they followed by the inexorable  avengers, and the only door here was a door out of the palace: out  every soul of them was driven, and left, some standing, some lying,  some crawling, to the farther buffeting of the waterspouts and  whirlwinds ranging every street of the city.
  The door was flung to  behind them, and they heard it locked and bolted and barred against  them.
            More Vengeance    As soon as they were gone, Curdie brought the creatures back to the  servants' hall, and told them to eat up everything on the table.
 It was  a sight to see them all standing round it--except such as had to get  upon it--eating and drinking, each after its fashion, without a smile,  or a word, or a glance of fellowship in the act.
 A very few moments  served to make everything eatable vanish, and then Curdie requested  them to clean house, and the page who stood by to assist them.
    Every one set about it except Ballbody: he could do nothing at  cleaning, for the more he rolled, the more he spread the dirt.
 Curdie  was curious to know what he had been, and how he had come to be such as  he was: but he could only conjecture that he was a gluttonous alderman  whom nature had treated homeopathically.
 And now there was such a  cleaning and clearing out of neglected places, such a burying and  burning of refuse, such a rinsing of jugs, such a swilling of sinks,  and such a flushing of drains as would have delighted the eyes of all  true housekeepers and lovers of cleanliness generally.
    Curdie meantime was with the king, telling him all he had done.
 They  had heard a little noise, but not much, for he had told the avengers to  repress outcry as much as possible; and they had seen to it that the  more anyone cried out the more he had to cry out upon, while the  patient ones they scarcely hurt at all.
    Having promised His Majesty and Her Royal Highness a good breakfast,  Curdie now went to finish the business.
  The courtiers must be dealt  with.
  A few who were the worst, and the leaders of the rest, must be  made examples of; the others should be driven to the street.
    He found the chiefs of the conspiracy holding a final consultation in  the smaller room off the hall.
  These were the lord chamberlain, the  attorney-general, the master of the horse, and the king's private  secretary: the lord chancellor and the rest, as foolish as faithless,  were but the tools of these.
    The housemaid had shown him a little closet, opening from a passage  behind, where he could overhear all that passed in that room; and now  Curdie heard enough to understand that they had determined, in the dead  of that night, rather in the deepest dark before the morning, to bring  a certain company of soldiers into the palace, make away with the king,  secure the princess, announce the sudden death of His Majesty, read as  his the will they had drawn up, and proceed to govern the country at  their ease, and with results: they would at once levy severer taxes,  and pick a quarrel with the most powerful of their neighbours.
  Everything settled, they agreed to retire, and have a few hours' quiet  sleep first--all but the secretary, who was to sit up and call them at  the proper moment.
 Curdie allowed them half an hour to get to bed, and  then set about completing his purgation of the palace.
    First he called Lina, and opened the door of the room where the  secretary sat.
  She crept in, and laid herself down against it.
 When  the secretary, rising to stretch his legs, caught sight of her eyes, he  stood frozen with terror.
  She made neither motion nor sound.
  Gathering courage, and taking the thing for a spectral illusion, he  made a step forward.
  She showed her other teeth, with a growl neither  more than audible nor less than horrible.
  The secretary sank fainting  into a chair.
  He was not a brave man, and besides, his conscience had  gone over to the enemy, and was sitting against the door by Lina.
    To the lord chamberlain's door next, Curdie conducted the legserpent,  and let him in.
    Now His Lordship had had a bedstead made for himself, sweetly fashioned  of rods of silver gilt: upon it the legserpent found him asleep, and  under it he crept.
  But out he came on the other side, and crept over  it next, and again under it, and so over it, under it, over it, five or  six times, every time leaving a coil of himself behind him, until he  had softly folded all his length about the lord chamberlain and his  bed.
  This done, he set up his head, looking down with curved neck  right over His Lordship's, and began to hiss in his face.
    He woke in terror unspeakable, and would have started up but the moment  he moved, the legserpent drew his coils closer, and closer still, and  drew and drew until the quaking traitor heard the joints of his  bedstead grinding and gnarring.
  Presently he persuaded himself that it  was only a horrid nightmare, and began to struggle with all his  strength to throw it off.
  Thereupon the legserpent gave his hooked  nose such a bite that his teeth met through it--but it was hardly  thicker than the bowl of a spoon; and then the vulture knew that he was  in the grasp of his enemy the snake, and yielded.
    As soon as he was quiet the legserpent began to untwist and retwist, to  uncoil and recoil himself, swinging and swaying, knotting and relaxing  himself with strangest curves and convolutions, always, however,  leaving at least one coil around his victim.
  At last he undid himself  entirely, and crept from the bed.
 Then first the lord chamberlain  discovered that his tormentor had bent and twisted the bedstead, legs  and canopy and all, so about him that he was shut in a silver cage out  of which it was impossible for him to find a way.
  Once more, thinking  his enemy was gone, he began to shout for help.
  But the instant he  opened his mouth his keeper darted at him and bit him, and after three  or four such essays, he lay still.
    The master of the horse Curdie gave in charge to the tapir.
  When the  soldier saw him enter--for he was not yet asleep--he sprang from his  bed, and flew at him with his sword.
  But the creature's hide was  invulnerable to his blows, and he pecked at his legs with his proboscis  until he jumped into bed again, groaning, and covered himself up; after  which the tapir contented himself with now and then paying a visit to  his toes.
    As for the attorney-general, Curdie led to his door a huge spider,  about two feet long in the body, which, having made an excellent  supper, was full of webbing.
  The attorney-general had not gone to bed,  but sat in a chair asleep before a great mirror.
  He had been trying  the effect of a diamond star which he had that morning taken from the  jewel room.
  When he woke he fancied himself paralysed; every limb,  every finger even, was motionless: coils and coils of broad spider  ribbon bandaged his members to his body, and all to the chair.
  In the  glass he saw himself wound about with slavery infinite.
  On a footstool  a yard off sat the spider glaring at him.
    Clubhead had mounted guard over the butler, where he lay tied hand and  foot under the third cask.
  From that cask he had seen the wine run  into a great bath, and therein he expected to be drowned.
  The doctor,  with his crushed leg, needed no one to guard him.
    And now Curdie proceeded to the expulsion of the rest.
  Great men or  underlings, he treated them all alike.
  From room to room over the  house he went, and sleeping or waking took the man by the hand.
 Such  was the state to which a year of wicked rule had reduced the moral  condition of the court, that in it all he found but three with human  hands.
  The possessors of these he allowed to dress themselves and  depart in peace.
  When they perceived his mission, and how he was  backed, they yielded.
    Then commenced a general hunt, to clear the house of the vermin.
 Out of  their beds in their night clothing, out of their rooms, gorgeous  chambers or garret nooks, the creatures hunted them.
  Not one was  allowed to escape.
  Tumult and noise there was little, for fear was too  deadly for outcry.
  Ferreting them out everywhere, following them  upstairs and downstairs, yielding no instant of repose except upon the  way out, the avengers persecuted the miscreants, until the last of them  was shivering outside the palace gates, with hardly sense enough left  to know where to turn.
    When they set out to look for shelter, they found every inn full of the  servants expelled before them, and not one would yield his place to a  superior suddenly levelled with himself.
  Most houses refused to admit  them on the ground of the wickedness that must have drawn on them such  a punishment; and not a few would have been left in the streets all  night, had not Derba, roused by the vain entreaties at the doors on  each side of her cottage, opened hers, and given up everything to them.
  The lord chancellor was only too glad to share a mattress with a  stableboy, and steal his bare feet under his jacket.
    In the morning Curdie appeared, and the outcasts were in terror,  thinking he had come after them again.
  But he took no notice of them:  his object was to request Derba to go to the palace: the king required  her services.
  She need take no trouble about her cottage, he said; the  palace was henceforward her home: she was the king's chatelaine over  men and maidens of his household.
  And this very morning she must cook  His Majesty a nice breakfast.
            The Preacher    Various reports went undulating through the city as to the nature of  what had taken place in the palace.
  The people gathered, and stared at  the house, eyeing it as if it had sprung up in the night.
 But it looked  sedate enough, remaining closed and silent, like a house that was dead.
  They saw no one come out or go in.
  Smoke arose from a chimney or two;  there was hardly another sign of life.
 It was not for some little time  generally understood that the highest officers of the crown as well as  the lowest menials of the palace had been dismissed in disgrace: for  who was to recognize a lord chancellor in his nightshirt?  And what  lord chancellor would, so attired in the street, proclaim his rank and  office aloud? Before it was day most of the courtiers crept down to the  river, hired boats, and betook themselves to their homes or their  friends in the country.
  It was assumed in the city that the domestics  had been discharged upon a sudden discovery of general and unpardonable  peculation; for, almost everybody being guilty of it himself, petty  dishonesty was the crime most easily credited and least easily passed  over in Gwyntystorm.
    Now that same day was Religion day, and not a few of the clergy, always  glad to seize on any passing event to give interest to the dull and  monotonic grind of their intellectual machines, made this remarkable  one the ground of discourse to their congregations.
 More especially  than the rest, the first priest of the great temple where was the royal  pew, judged himself, from his relation to the palace, called upon to  'improve the occasion', for they talked ever about improvement at  Gwyntystorm, all the time they were going down hill with a rush.
    The book which had, of late years, come to be considered the most  sacred, was called The Book of Nations, and consisted of proverbs, and  history traced through custom: from it the first priest chose his text;  and his text was, 'Honesty Is the Best Policy.
'  He was considered a  very eloquent man, but I can offer only a few of the larger bones of  his sermon.
    The main proof of the verity of their religion, he said, was that  things always went well with those who profess it; and its first  fundamental principle, grounded in inborn invariable instinct, was,  that every One should take care of that One.
  This was the first duty  of Man.
  If every one would but obey this law, number one, then would  every one be perfectly cared for--one being always equal to one.
  But  the faculty of care was in excess of need, and all that overflowed, and  would otherwise run to waste, ought to be gently turned in the  direction of one's neighbour, seeing that this also wrought for the  fulfilling of the law, inasmuch as the reaction of excess so directed  was upon the director of the same, to the comfort, that is, and  well-being of the original self.
  To be just and friendly was to build  the warmest and safest of all nests, and to be kind and loving was to  line it with the softest of all furs and feathers, for the one  precious, comfort-loving self there to lie, revelling in downiest  bliss.
  One of the laws therefore most binding upon men because of its  relation to the first and greatest of all duties, was embodied in the  Proverb he had just read; and what stronger proof of its wisdom and  truth could they desire than the sudden and complete vengeance which  had fallen upon those worse than ordinary sinners who had offended  against the king's majesty by forgetting that 'Honesty Is the Best  Policy'?    At this point of the discourse the head of the legserpent rose from the  floor of the temple, towering above the pulpit, above the priest, then  curving downward, with open mouth slowly descended upon him.
  Horror  froze the sermon-pump.
  He stared upward aghast.
 The great teeth of the  animal closed upon a mouthful of the sacred vestments, and slowly he  lifted the preacher from the pulpit, like a handful of linen from a  washtub, and, on his four solemn stumps, bore him out of the temple,  dangling aloft from his jaws.
  At the back of it he dropped him into  the dust hole among the remnants of a library whose age had destroyed  its value in the eyes of the chapter.
  They found him burrowing in it,  a lunatic henceforth--whose madness presented the peculiar feature,  that in its paroxysms he jabbered sense.
    Bone-freezing horror pervaded Gwyntystorm.
  If their best and wisest  were treated with such contempt, what might not the rest of them look  for?  Alas for their city!  Their grandly respectable city!  Their  loftily reasonable city!  Where it was all to end, who could tell!    But something must be done.
  Hastily assembling, the priests chose a  new first priest, and in full conclave unanimously declared and  accepted that the king in his retirement had, through the practice of  the blackest magic, turned the palace into a nest of demons in the  midst of them.
  A grand exorcism was therefore indispensable.
    In the meantime the fact came out that the greater part of the  courtiers had been dismissed as well as the servants, and this fact  swelled the hope of the Party of Decency, as they called themselves.
  Upon it they proceeded to act, and strengthened themselves on all sides.
    The action of the king's bodyguard remained for a time uncertain.
 But  when at length its officers were satisfied that both the master of the  horse and their colonel were missing, they placed themselves under the  orders of the first priest.
    Every one dated the culmination of the evil from the visit of the miner  and his mongrel; and the butchers vowed, if they could but get hold of  them again, they would roast both of them alive.
  At once they formed  themselves into a regiment, and put their dogs in training for attack.
    Incessant was the talk, innumerable were the suggestions, and great was  the deliberation.
  The general consent, however, was that as soon as  the priests should have expelled the demons, they would depose the  king, and attired in all his regal insignia, shut him in a cage for  public show; then choose governors, with the lord chancellor at their  head, whose first duty should be to remit every possible tax; and the  magistrates, by the mouth of the city marshal, required all able-bodied  citizens, in order to do their part toward the carrying out of these  and a multitude of other reforms, to be ready to take arms at the first  summons.
    Things needful were prepared as speedily as possible, and a mighty  ceremony, in the temple, in the market place, and in front of the  palace, was performed for the expulsion of the demons.
  This over, the  leaders retired to arrange an attack upon the palace.
    But that night events occurred which, proving the failure of their  first, induced the abandonment of their second, intent.
  Certain of the  prowling order of the community, whose numbers had of late been  steadily on the increase, reported frightful things.
  Demons of  indescribable ugliness had been espied careering through the midnight  streets and courts.
  A citizen--some said in the very act of  housebreaking, but no one cared to look into trifles at such a  crisis--had been seized from behind, he could not see by what, and  soused in the river.
  A well-known receiver of stolen goods had had his  shop broken open, and when he came down in the morning had found  everything in ruin on the pavement.
  The wooden image of justice over  the door of the city marshal had had the arm that held the sword bitten  off.
  The gluttonous magistrate had been pulled from his bed in the  dark, by beings of which he could see nothing but the flaming eyes, and  treated to a bath of the turtle soup that had been left simmering by  the side of the kitchen fire.
  Having poured it over him, they put him  again into his bed, where he soon learned how a mummy must feel in its  cerements.
    Worst of all, in the market place was fixed up a paper, with the king's  own signature, to the effect that whoever henceforth should show  inhospitality to strangers, and should be convicted of the same, should  be instantly expelled the city; while a second, in the butchers'  quarter, ordained that any dog which henceforth should attack a  stranger should be immediately destroyed.
  It was plain, said the  butchers, that the clergy were of no use; they could not exorcise  demons!  That afternoon, catching sight of a poor old fellow in rags  and tatters, quietly walking up the street, they hounded their dogs  upon him, and had it not been that the door of Derba's cottage was  standing open, and was near enough for him to dart in and shut it ere  they reached him, he would have been torn in pieces.
    And thus things went on for some days.
            Barbara    In the meantime, with Derba to minister to his wants, with Curdie to  protect him, and Irene to nurse him, the king was getting rapidly  stronger.
  Good food was what he most wanted and of that, at least of  certain kinds of it, there was plentiful store in the palace.
  Everywhere since the cleansing of the lower regions of it, the air was  clean and sweet, and under the honest hands of the one housemaid the  king's chamber became a pleasure to his eyes.
  With such changes it was  no wonder if his heart grew lighter as well as his brain clearer.
    But still evil dreams came and troubled him, the lingering result of  the wicked medicines the doctor had given him.
  Every night, sometimes  twice or thrice, he would wake up in terror, and it would be minutes  ere he could come to himself.
  The consequence was that he was always  worse in the morning, and had loss to make up during the day.
  While he  slept, Irene or Curdie, one or the other, must still be always by his  side.
    One night, when it was Curdie's turn with the king, he heard a cry  somewhere in the house, and as there was no other child, concluded,  notwithstanding the distance of her grandmother's room, that it must be  Barbara.
  Fearing something might be wrong, and noting the king's sleep  more quiet than usual, he ran to see.
  He found the child in the middle  of the floor, weeping bitterly, and Derba slumbering peacefully in bed.
  The instant she saw him the night-lost thing ceased her crying, smiled,  and stretched out her arms to him.
  Unwilling to wake the old woman,  who had been working hard all day, he took the child, and carried her  with him.
  She clung to him so, pressing her tear-wet radiant face  against his, that her little arms threatened to choke him.
    When he re-entered the chamber, he found the king sitting up in bed,  fighting the phantoms of some hideous dream.
  Generally upon such  occasions, although he saw his watcher, he could not dissociate him  from the dream, and went raving on.
  But the moment his eyes fell upon  little Barbara, whom he had never seen before, his soul came into them  with a rush, and a smile like the dawn of an eternal day overspread his  countenance; the dream was nowhere, and the child was in his heart.
  He  stretched out his arms to her, the child stretched out hers to him, and  in five minutes they were both asleep, each in the other's embrace.
    From that night Barbara had a crib in the king's chamber, and as often  as he woke, Irene or Curdie, whichever was watching, took the sleeping  child and laid her in his arms, upon which, invariably and instantly,  the dream would vanish.
  A great part of the day too she would be  playing on or about the king's bed; and it was a delight to the heart  of the princess to see her amusing herself with the crown, now sitting  upon it, now rolling it hither and thither about the room like a hoop.
  Her grandmother entering once while she was pretending to make porridge  in it, held up her hands in horror-struck amazement; but the king would  not allow her to interfere, for the king was now Barbara's playmate,  and his crown their plaything.
    The colonel of the guard also was growing better.
  Curdie went often to  see him.
  They were soon friends, for the best people understand each  other the easiest, and the grim old warrior loved the miner boy as if  he were at once his son and his angel.
  He was very anxious about his  regiment.
  He said the officers were mostly honest men, he believed,  but how they might be doing without him, or what they might resolve, in  ignorance of the real state of affairs, and exposed to every  misrepresentation, who could tell? Curdie proposed that he should send  for the major, offering to be the messenger.
  The colonel agreed, and  Curdie went--not without his mattock, because of the dogs.
    But the officers had been told by the master of the horse that their  colonel was dead, and although they were amazed he should be buried  without the attendance of his regiment, they never doubted the  information.
  The handwriting itself of their colonel was insufficient,  counteracted by the fresh reports daily current, to destroy the lie.
  The major regarded the letter as a trap for the next officer in  command, and sent his orderly to arrest the messenger.
  But Curdie had  had the wisdom not to wait for an answer.
    The king's enemies said that he had first poisoned the good colonel of  the guard, and then murdered the master of the horse, and other  faithful councillors; and that his oldest and most attached domestics  had but escaped from the palace with their lives--not all of them, for  the butler was missing.
  Mad or wicked, he was not only unfit to rule  any longer, but worse than unfit to have in his power and under his  influence the young princess, only hope of Gwyntystorm and the kingdom.
    The moment the lord chancellor reached his house in the country and had  got himself clothed, he began to devise how yet to destroy his master;  and the very next morning set out for the neighbouring kingdom of  Borsagrass to invite invasion, and offer a compact with its monarch.
            Peter    At the cottage in the mountain everything for a time went on just as  before.
  It was indeed dull without Curdie, but as often as they looked  at the emerald it was gloriously green, and with nothing to fear or  regret, and everything to hope, they required little comforting.
  One  morning, however, at last, Peter, who had been consulting the gem,  rather now from habit than anxiety, as a farmer his barometer in  undoubtful weather, turned suddenly to his wife, the stone in his hand,  and held it up with a look of ghastly dismay.
    'Why, that's never the emerald!' said Joan.
    'It is,' answered Peter; 'but it were small blame to any one that took  it for a bit of bottle glass!'    For, all save one spot right in the centre, of intensest and most  brilliant green, it looked as if the colour had been burnt out of it.
    'Run, run, Peter!' cried his wife.
  'Run and tell the old princess.
  It  may not be too late.
  The boy must be lying at death's door.
'    Without a word Peter caught up his mattock, darted from the cottage,  and was at the bottom of the hill in less time than he usually took to  get halfway.
    The door of the king's house stood open; he rushed in and up the stair.
  But after wandering about in vain for an hour, opening door after door,  and finding no way farther up, the heart of the old man had well-nigh  failed him.
  Empty rooms, empty rooms!--desertion and desolation  everywhere.
    At last he did come upon the door to the tower stair.
  Up he darted.
  Arrived at the top, he found three doors, and, one after the other,  knocked at them all.
  But there was neither voice nor hearing.
  Urged  by his faith and his dread, slowly, hesitatingly, he opened one.
  It  revealed a bare garret room, nothing in it but one chair and one  spinning wheel.
  He closed it, and opened the next--to start back in  terror, for he saw nothing but a great gulf, a moonless night, full of  stars, and, for all the stars, dark, dark!--a fathomless abyss.
  He  opened the third door, and a rush like the tide of a living sea invaded  his ears.
  Multitudinous wings flapped and flashed in the sun, and,  like the ascending column from a volcano, white birds innumerable shot  into the air, darkening the day with the shadow of their cloud, and  then, with a sharp sweep, as if bent sideways by a sudden wind, flew  northward, swiftly away, and vanished.
  The place felt like a tomb.
  There seemed no breath of life left in it.
    Despair laid hold upon him; he rushed down thundering with heavy feet.
  Out upon him darted the housekeeper like an ogress-spider, and after  her came her men; but Peter rushed past them, heedless and  careless--for had not the princess mocked him?--and sped along the road  to Gwyntystorm.
  What help lay in a miner's mattock, a man's arm, a  father's heart, he would bear to his boy.
    Joan sat up all night waiting his return, hoping and hoping.
  The  mountain was very still, and the sky was clear; but all night long the  miner sped northward, and the heart of his wife was troubled.
            The Sacrifice    Things in the palace were in a strange condition: the king playing with  a child and dreaming wise dreams, waited upon by a little princess with  the heart of a queen, and a youth from the mines, who went nowhere, not  even into the king's chamber, without his mattock on his shoulder and a  horrible animal at his heels; in a room nearby the colonel of his  guard, also in bed, without a soldier to obey him; in six other rooms,  far apart, six miscreants, each watched by a beast-jailer; ministers to  them all, an old woman and a page; and in the wine cellar, forty-three  animals, creatures more grotesque than ever brain of man invented.
  None dared approach its gates, and seldom one issued from them.
    All the dwellers in the city were united in enmity to the palace.
 It  swarmed with evil spirits, they said, whereas the evil spirits were in  the city, unsuspected.
  One consequence of their presence was that,  when the rumour came that a great army was on the march against  Gwyntystorm, instead of rushing to their defences, to make new gates,  free portcullises and drawbridges, and bar the river, each band flew  first to their treasures, burying them in their cellars and gardens,  and hiding them behind stones in their chimneys; and, next to  rebellion, signing an invitation to His Majesty of Borsagrass to enter  at their open gates, destroy their king, and annex their country to his  own.
    The straits of isolation were soon found in the palace: its invalids  were requiring stronger food, and what was to be done? For if the  butchers sent meat to the palace, was it not likely enough to be  poisoned?  Curdie said to Derba he would think of some plan before  morning.
    But that same night, as soon as it was dark, Lina came to her master,  and let him understand she wanted to go out.
  He unlocked a little  private postern for her, left it so that she could push it open when  she returned, and told the crocodile to stretch himself across it  inside.
  Before midnight she came back with a young deer.
    Early the next morning the legserpent crept out of the wine cellar,  through the broken door behind, shot into the river, and soon appeared  in the kitchen with a splendid sturgeon.
  Every night Lina went out  hunting, and every morning Legserpent went out fishing, and both  invalids and household had plenty to eat.
  As to news, the page, in  plain clothes, would now and then venture out into the market place,  and gather some.
    One night he came back with the report that the army of the king of  Borsagrass had crossed the border.
  Two days after, he brought the news  that the enemy was now but twenty miles from Gwyntystorm.
    The colonel of the guard rose, and began furbishing his armour--but  gave it over to the page, and staggered across to the barracks, which  were in the next street.
  The sentry took him for a ghost or worse, ran  into the guardroom, bolted the door, and stopped his ears.
  The poor  colonel, who was yet hardly able to stand, crawled back despairing.
    For Curdie, he had already, as soon as the first rumour reached him,  resolved, if no other instructions came, and the king continued unable  to give orders, to call Lina and the creatures, and march to meet the  enemy.
  If he died, he died for the right, and there was a right end of  it.
  He had no preparations to make, except a good sleep.
    He asked the king to let the housemaid take his place by His Majesty  that night, and went and lay down on the floor of the corridor, no  farther off than a whisper would reach from the door of the chamber.
  There, with an old mantle of the king's thrown over him, he was soon  fast asleep.
    Somewhere about the middle of the night, he woke suddenly, started to  his feet, and rubbed his eyes.
  He could not tell what had waked him.
  But could he be awake, or was he not dreaming?  The curtain of the  king's door, a dull red ever before, was glowing a gorgeous, a radiant  purple; and the crown wrought upon it in silks and gems was flashing as  if it burned!  What could it mean?  Was the king's chamber on fire?  He  darted to the door and lifted the curtain.
 Glorious terrible sight!    A long and broad marble table, that stood at one end of the room, had  been drawn into the middle of it, and thereon burned a great fire, of a  sort that Curdie knew--a fire of glowing, flaming roses, red and white.
  In the midst of the roses lay the king, moaning, but motionless.
  Every  rose that fell from the table to the floor, someone, whom Curdie could  not plainly see for the brightness, lifted and laid burning upon the  king's face, until at length his face too was covered with the live  roses, and he lay all within the fire, moaning still, with now and then  a shuddering sob.
    And the shape that Curdie saw and could not see, wept over the king as  he lay in the fire, and often she hid her face in handfuls of her  shadowy hair, and from her hair the water of her weeping dropped like  sunset rain in the light of the roses.
  At last she lifted a great  armful of her hair, and shook it over the fire, and the drops fell from  it in showers, and they did not hiss in the flames, but there arose  instead as it were the sound of running brooks.
    And the glow of the red fire died away, and the glow of the white fire  grew grey, and the light was gone, and on the table all was  black--except the face of the king, which shone from under the burnt  roses like a diamond in the ashes of a furnace.
    Then Curdie, no longer dazzled, saw and knew the old princess.
  The  room was lighted with the splendour of her face, of her blue eyes, of  her sapphire crown.
  Her golden hair went streaming out from her  through the air till it went off in mist and light.
  She was large and  strong as a Titaness.
  She stooped over the table-altar, put her mighty  arms under the living sacrifice, lifted the king, as if he were but a  little child, to her bosom, walked with him up the floor, and laid him  in his bed.
  Then darkness fell.
    The miner boy turned silent away, and laid himself down again in the  corridor.
  An absolute joy filled his heart, his bosom, his head, his  whole body.
  All was safe; all was well.
  With the helve of his mattock  tight in his grasp, he sank into a dreamless sleep.
            The King's Army    He woke like a giant refreshed with wine.
    When he went into the king's chamber, the housemaid sat where he had  left her, and everything in the room was as it had been the night  before, save that a heavenly odour of roses filled the air of it.
  He  went up to the bed.
  The king opened his eyes, and the soul of perfect  health shone out of them.
  Nor was Curdie amazed in his delight.
    'Is it not time to rise, Curdie?' said the king.
    'It is, Your Majesty.
  Today we must be doing,' answered Curdie.
    'What must we be doing today, Curdie?'    'Fighting, sire.
'    'Then fetch me my armour--that of plated steel, in the chest there.
  You will find the underclothing with it.
'    As he spoke, he reached out his hand for his sword, which hung in the  bed before him, drew it, and examined the blade.
    'A little rusty!' he said, 'but the edge is there.
  We shall polish it  ourselves today--not on the wheel.
  Curdie, my son, I wake from a  troubled dream.
  A glorious torture has ended it, and I live.
  I know  now well how things are, but you shall explain them to me as I get on  my armour.
  No, I need no bath.
  I am clean.
  Call the colonel of the  guard.
'    In complete steel the old man stepped into the chamber.
  He knew it  not, but the old princess had passed through his room in the night.
    'Why, Sir Bronzebeard!' said the king, 'you are dressed before me! You  need no valet, old man, when there is battle in the wind!'    'Battle, sire!' returned the colonel.
  'Where then are our soldiers?'    'Why, there and here,' answered the king, pointing to the colonel  first, and then to himself.
  'Where else, man?  The enemy will be upon  us ere sunset, if we be not upon him ere noon.
  What other thing was in  your brave brain when you donned your armour, friend?'    'Your Majesty's orders, sire,' answered Sir Bronzebeard.
    The king smiled and turned to Curdie.
    'And what was in yours, Curdie, for your first word was of battle?'    'See, Your Majesty,' answered Curdie; 'I have polished my mattock.
 If  Your Majesty had not taken the command, I would have met the enemy at  the head of my beasts, and died in comfort, or done better.
'    'Brave boy!' said the king.
  'He who takes his life in his hand is the  only soldier.
  You shall head your beasts today.
  Sir Bronzebeard, will  you die with me if need be?'    'Seven times, my king,' said the colonel.
    'Then shall we win this battle!' said the king.
  'Curdie, go and bind  securely the six, that we lose not their guards.
  Can you find me a  horse, think you, Sir Bronzebeard?  Alas! they told me my white charger  was dead.
'    'I will go and fright the varletry with my presence, and secure, I  trust, a horse for Your Majesty, and one for myself.
'    'And look you, brother!' said the king; 'bring one for my miner boy  too, and a sober old charger for the princess, for she too must go to  the battle, and conquer with us.
'    'Pardon me, sire,' said Curdie; 'a miner can fight best on foot.
 I  might smite my horse dead under me with a missed blow.
  And besides  that, I must be near to my beasts.
'    'As you will,' said the king.
  'Three horses then, Sir Bronzebeard.
'    The colonel departed, doubting sorely in his heart how to accoutre and  lead from the barrack stables three horses, in the teeth of his  revolted regiment.
    In the hall he met the housemaid.
    'Can you lead a horse?' he asked.
    'Yes, sir.
'    'Are you willing to die for the king?'    'Yes, sir.
'    'Can you do as you are bid?'    'I can keep on trying, sir.
'    'Come then.
  Were I not a man I would be a woman such as you.
'    When they entered the barrack yard, the soldiers scattered like autumn  leaves before a blast of winter.
  They went into the stable  unchallenged--and lo! in a stall, before the colonel's eyes, stood the  king's white charger, with the royal saddle and bridle hung high beside  him!    'Traitorous thieves!' muttered the old man in his beard, and went along  the stalls, looking for his own black charger.
  Having found him, he  returned to saddle first the king's.
  But the maid had already the  saddle upon him, and so girt that the colonel could thrust no finger  tip between girth and skin.
  He left her to finish what she had so well  begun, and went and made ready his own.
  He then chose for the princess  a great red horse, twenty years old, which he knew to possess every  equine virtue.
  This and his own he led to the palace, and the maid led  the king's.
    The king and Curdie stood in the court, the king in full armour of  silvered steel, with a circlet of rubies and diamonds round his helmet.
  He almost leaped for joy when he saw his great white charger come in,  gentle as a child to the hand of the housemaid.
 But when the horse saw  his master in his armour, he reared and bounded in jubilation, yet did  not break from the hand that held him.
  Then out came the princess  attired and ready, with a hunting knife her father had given her by her  side.
  They brought her mother's saddle, splendent with gems and gold,  set it on the great red horse, and lifted her to it.
  But the saddle  was so big, and the horse so tall, that the child found no comfort in  them.
    'Please, King Papa,' she said, 'can I not have my white pony?'    'I did not think of him, little one,' said the king.
  'Where is he?'    'In the stable,' answered the maid.
  'I found him half starved, the  only horse within the gates, the day after the servants were driven  out.
  He has been well fed since.
'    'Go and fetch him,' said the king.
    As the maid appeared with the pony, from a side door came Lina and the  forty-nine, following Curdie.
    'I will go with Curdie and the Uglies,' cried the princess; and as soon  as she was mounted she got into the middle of the pack.
    So out they set, the strangest force that ever went against an enemy.
  The king in silver armour sat stately on his white steed, with the  stones flashing on his helmet; beside him the grim old colonel, armed  in steel, rode his black charger; behind the king, a little to the  right, Curdie walked afoot, his mattock shining in the sun; Lina  followed at his heel; behind her came the wonderful company of Uglies;  in the midst of them rode the gracious little Irene, dressed in blue,  and mounted on the prettiest of white ponies; behind the colonel, a  little to the left, walked the page, armed in a breastplate, headpiece,  and trooper's sword he had found in the palace, all much too big for  him, and carrying a huge brass trumpet which he did his best to blow;  and the king smiled and seemed pleased with his music, although it was  but the grunt of a brazen unrest.
  Alongside the beasts walked Derba  carrying Barbara--their refuge the mountains, should the cause of the  king be lost; as soon as they were over the river they turned aside to  ascend the Cliff, and there awaited the forging of the day's history.
  Then first Curdie saw that the housemaid, whom they had all forgotten,  was following, mounted on the great red horse, and seated in the royal  saddle.
    Many were the eyes unfriendly of women that had stared at them from  door and window as they passed through the city; and low laughter and  mockery and evil words from the lips of children had rippled about  their ears; but the men were all gone to welcome the enemy, the  butchers the first, the king's guard the last.
  And now on the heels of  the king's army rushed out the women and children also, to gather  flowers and branches, wherewith to welcome their conquerors.
    About a mile down the river, Curdie, happening to look behind him, saw  the maid, whom he had supposed gone with Derba, still following on the  great red horse.
  The same moment the king, a few paces in front of  him, caught sight of the enemy's tents, pitched where, the cliffs  receding, the bank of the river widened to a little plain.
            The Battle    He commanded the page to blow his trumpet; and, in the strength of the  moment, the youth uttered a right warlike defiance.
    But the butchers and the guard, who had gone over armed to the enemy,  thinking that the king had come to make his peace also, and that it  might thereafter go hard with them, rushed at once to make short work  with him, and both secure and commend themselves.
  The butchers came on  first--for the guards had slackened their saddle girths--brandishing  their knives, and talking to their dogs.
 Curdie and the page, with Lina  and her pack, bounded to meet them.
 Curdie struck down the foremost  with his mattock.
  The page, finding his sword too much for him, threw  it away and seized the butcher's knife, which as he rose he plunged  into the foremost dog.
 Lina rushed raging and gnashing among them.
  She  would not look at a dog so long as there was a butcher on his legs, and  she never stopped to kill a butcher, only with one grind of her jaws  crushed a leg of him.
  When they were all down, then indeed she flashed  among the dogs.
    Meantime the king and the colonel had spurred toward the advancing  guard.
  The king clove the major through skull and collar bone, and the  colonel stabbed the captain in the throat.
  Then a fierce combat  commenced--two against many.
  But the butchers and their dogs quickly  disposed of, up came Curdie and his beasts.
  The horses of the guard,  struck with terror, turned in spite of the spur, and fled in confusion.
    Thereupon the forces of Borsagrass, which could see little of the  affair, but correctly imagined a small determined body in front of  them, hastened to the attack.
  No sooner did their first advancing wave  appear through the foam of the retreating one, than the king and the  colonel and the page, Curdie and the beasts, went charging upon them.
  Their attack, especially the rush of the Uglies, threw the first line  into great confusion, but the second came up quickly; the beasts could  not be everywhere, there were thousands to one against them, and the  king and his three companions were in the greatest possible danger.
    A dense cloud came over the sun, and sank rapidly toward the earth.
 The  cloud moved all together, and yet the thousands of white flakes of  which it was made up moved each for itself in ceaseless and rapid  motion: those flakes were the wings of pigeons.
  Down swooped the birds  upon the invaders; right in the face of man and horse they flew with  swift-beating wings, blinding eyes and confounding brain.
  Horses  reared and plunged and wheeled.
  All was at once in confusion.
  The men  made frantic efforts to seize their tormentors, but not one could they  touch; and they outdoubled them in numbers.
 Between every wild clutch  came a peck of beak and a buffet of pinion in the face.
  Generally the  bird would, with sharp-clapping wings, dart its whole body, with the  swiftness of an arrow, against its singled mark, yet so as to glance  aloft the same instant, and descend skimming; much as the thin stone,  shot with horizontal cast of arm, having touched and torn the surface  of the lake, ascends to skim, touch, and tear again.
  So mingled the  feathered multitude in the grim game of war.
  It was a storm in which  the wind was birds, and the sea men.
  And ever as each bird arrived at  the rear of the enemy, it turned, ascended, and sped to the front to  charge again.
    The moment the battle began, the princess's pony took fright, and  turned and fled.
  But the maid wheeled her horse across the road and  stopped him; and they waited together the result of the battle.
    And as they waited, it seemed to the princess right strange that the  pigeons, every one as it came to the rear, and fetched a compass to  gather force for the reattack, should make the head of her attendant on  the red horse the goal around which it turned; so that about them was  an unintermittent flapping and flashing of wings, and a curving,  sweeping torrent of the side-poised wheeling bodies of birds.
  Strange  also it seemed that the maid should be constantly waving her arm toward  the battle.
  And the time of the motion of her arm so fitted with the  rushes of birds, that it looked as if the birds obeyed her gesture, and  she was casting living javelins by the thousand against the enemy.
  The  moment a pigeon had rounded her head, it went off straight as bolt from  bow, and with trebled velocity.
    But of these strange things, others besides the princess had taken  note.
  From a rising ground whence they watched the battle in growing  dismay, the leaders of the enemy saw the maid and her motions, and,  concluding her an enchantress, whose were the airy legions humiliating  them, set spurs to their horses, made a circuit, outflanked the king,  and came down upon her.
  But suddenly by her side stood a stalwart old  man in the garb of a miner, who, as the general rode at her, sword in  hand, heaved his swift mattock, and brought it down with such force on  the forehead of his charger, that he fell to the ground like a log.
  His rider shot over his head and lay stunned.
  Had not the great red  horse reared and wheeled, he would have fallen beneath that of the  general.
    With lifted sabre, one of his attendant officers rode at the miner.
 But  a mass of pigeons darted in the faces of him and his horse, and the  next moment he lay beside his commander.
    The rest of them turned and fled, pursued by the birds.
    'Ah, friend Peter!' said the maid; 'thou hast come as I told thee!  Welcome and thanks!'    By this time the battle was over.
  The rout was general.
  The enemy  stormed back upon their own camp, with the beasts roaring in the midst  of them, and the king and his army, now reinforced by one, pursuing.
  But presently the king drew rein.
    'Call off your hounds, Curdie, and let the pigeons do the rest,' he  shouted, and turned to see what had become of the princess.
    In full panic fled the invaders, sweeping down their tents, stumbling  over their baggage, trampling on their dead and wounded, ceaselessly  pursued and buffeted by the white-winged army of heaven.
  Homeward they  rushed the road they had come, straight for the borders, many dropping  from pure fatigue, and lying where they fell.
  And still the pigeons  were in their necks as they ran.
  At length to the eyes of the king and  his army nothing was visible save a dust cloud below, and a bird cloud  above.
  Before night the bird cloud came back, flying high over  Gwyntystorm.
  Sinking swiftly, it disappeared among the ancient roofs  of the palace.
            Judgement    The king and his army returned, bringing with them one prisoner only,  the lord chancellor.
  Curdie had dragged him from under a fallen tent,  not by the hand of a man, but by the foot of a mule.
    When they entered the city, it was still as the grave.
  The citizens  had fled home.
  'We must submit,' they cried, 'or the king and his  demons will destroy us.
'  The king rode through the streets in silence,  ill-pleased with his people.
  But he stopped his horse in the midst of  the market place, and called, in a voice loud and clear as the cry of a  silver trumpet, 'Go and find your own.
  Bury your dead, and bring home  your wounded.
'  Then he turned him gloomily to the palace.
    Just as they reached the gates, Peter, who, as they went, had been  telling his tale to Curdie, ended it with the words:    'And so there I was, in the nick of time to save the two princesses!'    'The two princesses, Father!  The one on the great red horse was the  housemaid,' said Curdie, and ran to open the gates for the king.
    They found Derba returned before them, and already busy preparing them  food.
  The king put up his charger with his own hands, rubbed him down,  and fed him.
    When they had washed, and eaten and drunk, he called the colonel, and  told Curdie and the page to bring out the traitors and the beasts, and  attend him to the market place.
    By this time the people were crowding back into the city, bearing their  dead and wounded.
  And there was lamentation in Gwyntystorm, for no one  could comfort himself, and no one had any to comfort him.
  The nation  was victorious, but the people were conquered.
    The king stood in the centre of the market place, upon the steps of the  ancient cross.
  He had laid aside his helmet and put on his crown, but  he stood all armed beside, with his sword in his hand.
 He called the  people to him, and, for all the terror of the beasts, they dared not  disobey him.
  Those, even, who were carrying their wounded laid them  down, and drew near trembling.
    Then the king said to Curdie and the page:    'Set the evil men before me.
'    He looked upon them for a moment in mingled anger and pity, then turned  to the people and said:    'Behold your trust!  Ye slaves, behold your leaders!  I would have  freed you, but ye would not be free.
  Now shall ye be ruled with a rod  of iron, that ye may learn what freedom is, and love it and seek it.
  These wretches I will send where they shall mislead you no longer.
'    He made a sign to Curdie, who immediately brought up the legserpent.
  To the body of the animal they bound the lord chamberlain, speechless  with horror.
  The butler began to shriek and pray, but they bound him  on the back of Clubhead.
  One after another, upon the largest of the  creatures they bound the whole seven, each through the unveiling terror  looking the villain he was.
  Then said the king:    'I thank you, my good beasts; and I hope to visit you ere long.
 Take  these evil men with you, and go to your place.
'    Like a whirlwind they were in the crowd, scattering it like dust.
 Like  hounds they rushed from the city, their burdens howling and raving.
    What became of them I have never heard.
    Then the king turned once more to the people and said, 'Go to your  houses'; nor vouchsafed them another word.
  They crept home like  chidden hounds.
    The king returned to the palace.
  He made the colonel a duke, and the  page a knight, and Peter he appointed general of all his mines.
 But to  Curdie he said:    'You are my own boy, Curdie.
  My child cannot choose but love you, and  when you are grown up--if you both will--you shall marry each other,  and be king and queen when I am gone.
  Till then be the king's Curdie.
'    Irene held out her arms to Curdie.
  He raised her in his, and she  kissed him.
    'And my Curdie too!' she said.
    Thereafter the people called him Prince Conrad; but the king always  called him either just Curdie, or my miner boy.
    They sat down to supper, and Derba and the knight and the housemaid  waited, and Barbara sat at the king's left hand.
  The housemaid poured  out the wine; and as she poured for Curdie red wine that foamed in the  cup, as if glad to see the light whence it had been banished so long,  she looked him in the eyes.
  And Curdie started, and sprang from his  seat, and dropped on his knees, and burst into tears.
  And the maid  said with a smile, such as none but one could smile:    'Did I not tell you, Curdie, that it might be you would not know me  when next you saw me?'    Then she went from the room, and in a moment returned in royal purple,  with a crown of diamonds and rubies, from under which her hair went  flowing to the floor, all about her ruby-slippered feet.
 Her face was  radiant with joy, the joy overshadowed by a faint mist as of  unfulfilment.
  The king rose and kneeled on one knee before her.
  All  kneeled in like homage.
  Then the king would have yielded her his royal  chair.
  But she made them all sit down, and with her own hands placed  at the table seats for Derba and the page.
  Then in ruby crown and  royal purple she served them all.
            The End    The king sent Curdie out into his dominions to search for men and women  that had human hands.
  And many such he found, honest and true, and  brought them to his master.
  So a new and upright court was formed, and  strength returned to the nation.
    But the exchequer was almost empty, for the evil men had squandered  everything, and the king hated taxes unwillingly paid.
  Then came  Curdie and said to the king that the city stood upon gold.
  And the  king sent for men wise in the ways of the earth, and they built  smelting furnaces, and Peter brought miners, and they mined the gold,  and smelted it, and the king coined it into money, and therewith  established things well in the land.
    The same day on which he found his boy, Peter set out to go home.
 When  he told the good news to Joan, his wife, she rose from her chair and  said, 'Let us go.
'  And they left the cottage, and repaired to  Gwyntystorm.
  And on a mountain above the city they built themselves a  warm house for their old age, high in the clear air.
    As Peter mined one day, at the back of the king's wine Cellar, he broke  into a cavern crusted with gems, and much wealth flowed therefrom, and  the king used it wisely.
    Queen Irene--that was the right name of the old princess--was  thereafter seldom long absent from the palace.
  Once or twice when she  was missing, Barbara, who seemed to know of her sometimes when nobody  else had a notion whither she had gone, said she was with the dear old  Uglies in the wood.
  Curdie thought that perhaps her business might be  with others there as well.
  All the uppermost rooms in the palace were  left to her use, and when any one was in need of her help, up thither  he must go.
  But even when she was there, he did not always succeed in  finding her.
  She, however, always knew that such a one had been  looking for her.
    Curdie went to find her one day.
  As he ascended the last stair, to  meet him came the well-known scent of her roses; and when he opened the  door, lo! there was the same gorgeous room in which his touch had been  glorified by her fire!  And there burned the fire--a huge heap of red  and white roses.
  Before the hearth stood the princess, an old  grey-haired woman, with Lina a little behind her, slowly wagging her  tail, and looking like a beast of prey that can hardly so long restrain  itself from springing as to be sure of its victim.
 The queen was  casting roses, more and more roses, upon the fire.
 At last she turned  and said, 'Now Lina!'--and Lina dashed burrowing into the fire.
  There  went up a black smoke and a dust, and Lina was never more seen in the  palace.
    Irene and Curdie were married.
  The old king died, and they were king  and queen.
  As long as they lived Gwyntystorm was a better city, and  good people grew in it.
  But they had no children, and when they died  the people chose a king.
  And the new king went mining and mining in  the rock under the city, and grew more and more eager after the gold,  and paid less and less heed to his people.
  Rapidly they sank toward  their old wickedness.
  But still the king went on mining, and coining  gold by the pailful, until the people were worse even than in the old  time.
  And so greedy was the king after gold, that when at last the ore  began to fail, he caused the miners to reduce the pillars which Peter  and they that followed him had left standing to bear the city.
  And  from the girth of an oak of a thousand years, they chipped them down to  that of a fir tree of fifty.
    One day at noon, when life was at its highest, the whole city fell with  a roaring crash.
  The cries of men and the shrieks of women went up  with its dust, and then there was a great silence.
    Where the mighty rock once towered, crowded with homes and crowned with  a palace, now rushes and raves a stone-obstructed rapid of the river.
  All around spreads a wilderness of wild deer, and the very name of  Gwyntystorm had ceased from the lips of men.

  The Last Chapter              Why the Princess Has a Story About Her    There was once a little princess whose father was king over a great  country full of mountains and valleys.
  His palace was built upon one  of the mountains, and was very grand and beautiful.
  The princess,  whose name was Irene, was born there, but she was sent soon after her  birth, because her mother was not very strong, to be brought up by  country people in a large house, half castle, half farmhouse, on the  side of another mountain, about half-way between its base and its peak.
    The princess was a sweet little creature, and at the time my story  begins was about eight years old, I think, but she got older very fast.
  Her face was fair and pretty, with eyes like two bits of night sky,  each with a star dissolved in the blue.
  Those eyes you would have  thought must have known they came from there, so often were they turned  up in that direction.
  The ceiling of her nursery was blue, with stars  in it, as like the sky as they could make it.
 But I doubt if ever she  saw the real sky with the stars in it, for a reason which I had better  mention at once.
    These mountains were full of hollow places underneath; huge caverns,  and winding ways, some with water running through them, and some  shining with all colours of the rainbow when a light was taken in.
  There would not have been much known about them, had there not been  mines there, great deep pits, with long galleries and passages running  off from them, which had been dug to get at the ore of which the  mountains were full.
  In the course of digging, the miners came upon  many of these natural caverns.
  A few of them had far-off openings out  on the side of a mountain, or into a ravine.
    Now in these subterranean caverns lived a strange race of beings,  called by some gnomes, by some kobolds, by some goblins.
  There was a  legend current in the country that at one time they lived above ground,  and were very like other people.
  But for some reason or other,  concerning which there were different legendary theories, the king had  laid what they thought too severe taxes upon them, or had required  observances of them they did not like, or had begun to treat them with  more severity, in some way or other, and impose stricter laws; and the  consequence was that they had all disappeared from the face of the  country.
  According to the legend, however, instead of going to some  other country, they had all taken refuge in the subterranean caverns,  whence they never came out but at night, and then seldom showed  themselves in any numbers, and never to many people at once.
  It was  only in the least frequented and most difficult parts of the mountains  that they were said to gather even at night in the open air.
  Those who  had caught sight of any of them said that they had greatly altered in  the course of generations; and no wonder, seeing they lived away from  the sun, in cold and wet and dark places.
  They were now, not  ordinarily ugly, but either absolutely hideous, or ludicrously  grotesque both in face and form.
  There was no invention, they said, of  the most lawless imagination expressed by pen or pencil, that could  surpass the extravagance of their appearance.
  But I suspect those who  said so had mistaken some of their animal companions for the goblins  themselves--of which more by and by.
  The goblins themselves were not  so far removed from the human as such a description would imply.
  And  as they grew misshapen in body they had grown in knowledge and  cleverness, and now were able to do things no mortal could see the  possibility of.
  But as they grew in cunning, they grew in mischief,  and their great delight was in every way they could think of to annoy  the people who lived in the open-air storey above them.
  They had  enough of affection left for each other to preserve them from being  absolutely cruel for cruelty's sake to those that came in their way;  but still they so heartily cherished the ancestral grudge against those  who occupied their former possessions and especially against the  descendants of the king who had caused their expulsion, that they  sought every opportunity of tormenting them in ways that were as odd as  their inventors; and although dwarfed and misshapen, they had strength  equal to their cunning.
  In the process of time they had got a king and  a government of their own, whose chief business, beyond their own  simple affairs, was to devise trouble for their neighbours.
  It will  now be pretty evident why the little princess had never seen the sky at  night.
  They were much too afraid of the goblins to let her out of the  house then, even in company with ever so many attendants; and they had  good reason, as we shall see by and by.
            The Princess Loses Herself    I have said the Princess Irene was about eight years old when my story  begins.
  And this is how it begins.
    One very wet day, when the mountain was covered with mist which was  constantly gathering itself together into raindrops, and pouring down  on the roofs of the great old house, whence it fell in a fringe of  water from the eaves all round about it, the princess could not of  course go out.
  She got very tired, so tired that even her toys could  no longer amuse her.
  You would wonder at that if I had time to  describe to you one half of the toys she had.
  But then, you wouldn't  have the toys themselves, and that makes all the difference: you can't  get tired of a thing before you have it.
  It was a picture, though,  worth seeing--the princess sitting in the nursery with the sky ceiling  over her head, at a great table covered with her toys.
  If the artist  would like to draw this, I should advise him not to meddle with the  toys.
  I am afraid of attempting to describe them, and I think he had  better not try to draw them.
  He had better not.
  He can do a thousand  things I can't, but I don't think he could draw those toys.
  No man  could better make the princess herself than he could, though--leaning  with her back bowed into the back of the chair, her head hanging down,  and her hands in her lap, very miserable as she would say herself, not  even knowing what she would like, except it were to go out and get  thoroughly wet, and catch a particularly nice cold, and have to go to  bed and take gruel.
  The next moment after you see her sitting there,  her nurse goes out of the room.
    Even that is a change, and the princess wakes up a little, and looks  about her.
  Then she tumbles off her chair and runs out of the door,  not the same door the nurse went out of, but one which opened at the  foot of a curious old stair of worm-eaten oak, which looked as if never  anyone had set foot upon it.
  She had once before been up six steps,  and that was sufficient reason, in such a day, for trying to find out  what was at the top of it.
    Up and up she ran--such a long way it seemed to her!--until she came to  the top of the third flight.
  There she found the landing was the end  of a long passage.
  Into this she ran.
  It was full of doors on each  side.
  There were so many that she did not care to open any, but ran on  to the end, where she turned into another passage, also full of doors.
  When she had turned twice more, and still saw doors and only doors  about her, she began to get frightened.
  It was so silent!  And all  those doors must hide rooms with nobody in them!  That was dreadful.
  Also the rain made a great trampling noise on the roof.
  She turned and  started at full speed, her little footsteps echoing through the sounds  of the rain--back for the stairs and her safe nursery.
  So she thought,  but she had lost herself long ago.
  It doesn't follow that she was  lost, because she had lost herself, though.
    She ran for some distance, turned several times, and then began to be  afraid.
  Very soon she was sure that she had lost the way back.
 Rooms  everywhere, and no stair!  Her little heart beat as fast as her little  feet ran, and a lump of tears was growing in her throat.
 But she was  too eager and perhaps too frightened to cry for some time.
  At last her  hope failed her.
  Nothing but passages and doors everywhere!  She threw  herself on the floor, and burst into a wailing cry broken by sobs.
    She did not cry long, however, for she was as brave as could be  expected of a princess of her age.
  After a good cry, she got up, and  brushed the dust from her frock.
  Oh, what old dust it was! Then she  wiped her eyes with her hands, for princesses don't always have their  handkerchiefs in their pockets, any more than some other little girls I  know of.
  Next, like a true princess, she resolved on going wisely to  work to find her way back: she would walk through the passages, and  look in every direction for the stair.
 This she did, but without  success.
  She went over the same ground again an again without knowing  it, for the passages and doors were all alike.
  At last, in a corner,  through a half-open door, she did see a stair.
  But alas! it went the  wrong way: instead of going down, it went up.
  Frightened as she was,  however, she could not help wishing to see where yet further the stair  could lead.
  It was very narrow, and so steep that she went on like a  four-legged creature on her hands and feet.
            The Princess and--We Shall See Who    When she came to the top, she found herself in a little square place,  with three doors, two opposite each other, and one opposite the top of  the stair.
  She stood for a moment, without an idea in her little head  what to do next.
  But as she stood, she began to hear a curious humming  sound.
  Could it be the rain?  No.
  It was much more gentle, and even  monotonous than the sound of the rain, which now she scarcely heard.
  The low sweet humming sound went on, sometimes stopping for a little  while and then beginning again.
  It was more like the hum of a very  happy bee that had found a rich well of honey in some globular flower,  than anything else I can think of at this moment.
  Where could it come  from?  She laid her ear first to one of the doors to hearken if it was  there--then to another.
  When she laid her ear against the third door,  there could be no doubt where it came from: it must be from something  in that room.
  What could it be?  She was rather afraid, but her  curiosity was stronger than her fear, and she opened the door very  gently and peeped in.
  What do you think she saw?  A very old lady who  sat spinning.
    Perhaps you will wonder how the princess could tell that the old lady  was an old lady, when I inform you that not only was she beautiful, but  her skin was smooth and white.
  I will tell you more.
  Her hair was  combed back from her forehead and face, and hung loose far down and all  over her back.
  That is not much like an old lady--is it?  Ah! but it  was white almost as snow.
  And although her face was so smooth, her  eyes looked so wise that you could not have helped seeing she must be  old.
  The princess, though she could not have told you why, did think  her very old indeed--quite fifty, she said to herself.
  But she was  rather older than that, as you shall hear.
    While the princess stared bewildered, with her head just inside the  door, the old lady lifted hers, and said, in a sweet, but old and  rather shaky voice, which mingled very pleasantly with the continued  hum of her wheel:    'Come in, my dear; come in.
  I am glad to see you.
'    That the princess was a real princess you might see now quite plainly;  for she didn't hang on to the handle of the door, and stare without  moving, as I have known some do who ought to have been princesses but  were only rather vulgar little girls.
  She did as she was told, stepped  inside the door at once, and shut it gently behind her.
    'Come to me, my dear,' said the old lady.
    And again the princess did as she was told.
  She approached the old  lady--rather slowly, I confess--but did not stop until she stood by her  side, and looked up in her face with her blue eyes and the two melted  stars in them.
    'Why, what have you been doing with your eyes, child?' asked the old  lady.
    'Crying,' answered the princess.
    'Why, child?'    'Because I couldn't find my way down again.
'    'But you could find your way up.
'    'Not at first--not for a long time.
'    'But your face is streaked like the back of a zebra.
  Hadn't you a  handkerchief to wipe your eyes with?'    'No.
'    'Then why didn't you come to me to wipe them for you?'    'Please, I didn't know you were here.
  I will next time.
'    'There's a good child!' said the old lady.
    Then she stopped her wheel, and rose, and, going out of the room,  returned with a little silver basin and a soft white towel, with which  she washed and wiped the bright little face.
  And the princess thought  her hands were so smooth and nice!    When she carried away the basin and towel, the little princess wondered  to see how straight and tall she was, for, although she was so old, she  didn't stoop a bit.
  She was dressed in black velvet with thick white  heavy-looking lace about it; and on the black dress her hair shone like  silver.
  There was hardly any more furniture in the room than there  might have been in that of the poorest old woman who made her bread by  her spinning.
  There was no carpet on the floor--no table  anywhere--nothing but the spinning-wheel and the chair beside it.
  When  she came back, she sat down and without a word began her spinning once  more, while Irene, who had never seen a spinning-wheel, stood by her  side and looked on.
  When the old lady had got her thread fairly going  again, she said to the princess, but without looking at her:    'Do you know my name, child?'    'No, I don't know it,' answered the princess.
    'My name is Irene.
'    'That's my name!' cried the princess.
    'I know that.
  I let you have mine.
  I haven't got your name.
 You've  got mine.
'    'How can that be?' asked the princess, bewildered.
  'I've always had my  name.
'    'Your papa, the king, asked me if I had any objection to your having  it; and, of course, I hadn't.
  I let you have it with pleasure.
'    'It was very kind of you to give me your name--and such a pretty one,'  said the princess.
    'Oh, not so very kind!' said the old lady.
  'A name is one of those  things one can give away and keep all the same.
  I have a good many  such things.
  Wouldn't you like to know who I am, child?'    'Yes, that I should--very much.
'    'I'm your great-great-grandmother,' said the lady.
    'What's that?' asked the princess.
    'I'm your father's mother's father's mother.
'    'Oh, dear! I can't understand that,' said the princess.
    'I dare say not.
  I didn't expect you would.
  But that's no reason why  I shouldn't say it.
'    'Oh, no!' answered the princess.
    'I will explain it all to you when you are older,' the lady went on.
  'But you will be able to understand this much now: I came here to take  care of you.
'    'Is it long since you came?  Was it yesterday?  Or was it today,  because it was so wet that I couldn't get out?'    'I've been here ever since you came yourself.
'    'What a long time!' said the princess.
  'I don't remember it at all.
'    'No.
  I suppose not.
'    'But I never saw you before.
'    'No.
  But you shall see me again.
'    'Do you live in this room always?'    'I don't sleep in it.
  I sleep on the opposite side of the landing.
 I  sit here most of the day.
'    'I shouldn't like it.
  My nursery is much prettier.
  You must be a  queen too, if you are my great big grand-mother.
'    'Yes, I am a queen.
'    'Where is your crown, then?' 'In my bedroom.
'    'I should like to see it.
'    'You shall some day--not today.
'    'I wonder why nursie never told me.
'    'Nursie doesn't know.
  She never saw me.
'    'But somebody knows that you are in the house?'    'No; nobody.
'    'How do you get your dinner, then?'    'I keep poultry--of a sort.
'    'Where do you keep them?'    'I will show you.
'    'And who makes the chicken broth for you?'    'I never kill any of MY chickens.
'    'Then I can't understand.
'    'What did you have for breakfast this morning?' asked the lady.
    'Oh! I had bread and milk, and an egg--I dare say you eat their eggs.
'    'Yes, that's it.
  I eat their eggs.
'    'Is that what makes your hair so white?'    'No, my dear.
  It's old age.
  I am very old.
'    'I thought so.
  Are you fifty?'    'Yes--more than that.
'    'Are you a hundred?'    'Yes--more than that.
  I am too old for you to guess.
  Come and see my  chickens.
'    Again she stopped her spinning.
  She rose, took the princess by the  hand, led her out of the room, and opened the door opposite the stair.
  The princess expected to see a lot of hens and chickens, but instead of  that, she saw the blue sky first, and then the roofs of the house, with  a multitude of the loveliest pigeons, mostly white, but of all colours,  walking about, making bows to each other, and talking a language she  could not understand.
  She clapped her hands with delight, and up rose  such a flapping of wings that she in her turn was startled.
    'You've frightened my poultry,' said the old lady, smiling.
    'And they've frightened me,' said the princess, smiling too.
  'But what  very nice poultry!  Are the eggs nice?'    'Yes, very nice.
' 'What a small egg-spoon you must have!  Wouldn't it  be better to keep hens, and get bigger eggs?'    'How should I feed them, though?'    'I see,' said the princess.
  'The pigeons feed themselves.
  They've got  wings.
'    'Just so.
  If they couldn't fly, I couldn't eat their eggs.
'    'But how do you get at the eggs?  Where are their nests?'    The lady took hold of a little loop of string in the wall at the side  of the door and, lifting a shutter, showed a great many pigeon-holes  with nests, some with young ones and some with eggs in them.
  The birds  came in at the other side, and she took out the eggs on this side.
  She  closed it again quickly, lest the young ones should be frightened.
    'Oh, what a nice way!' cried the princess.
  'Will you give me an egg to  eat?  I'm rather hungry.
'    'I will some day, but now you must go back, or nursie will be miserable  about you.
  I dare say she's looking for you everywhere.
'    'Except here,' answered the princess.
  'Oh, how surprised she will be  when I tell her about my great big grand-grand-mother!'    'Yes, that she will!' said the old lady with a curious smile.
 'Mind you  tell her all about it exactly.
'    'That I will.
  Please will you take me back to her?'    'I can't go all the way, but I will take you to the top of the stair,  and then you must run down quite fast into your own room.
'    The little princess put her hand in the old lady's, who, looking this  way and that, brought her to the top of the first stair, and thence to  the bottom of the second, and did not leave her till she saw her  half-way down the third.
  When she heard the cry of her nurse's  pleasure at finding her, she turned and walked up the stairs again,  very fast indeed for such a very great grandmother, and sat down to her  spinning with another strange smile on her sweet old face.
    About this spinning of hers I will tell you more another time.
    Guess what she was spinning.
            What the Nurse Thought of It    'Why, where can you have been, princess?' asked the nurse, taking her  in her arms.
  'It's very unkind of you to hide away so long.
 I began to  be afraid--'  Here she checked herself.
    'What were you afraid of, nursie?' asked the princess.
    'Never mind,' she answered.
  'Perhaps I will tell you another day.
 Now  tell me where you have been.
'    'I've been up a long way to see my very great, huge, old grandmother,'  said the princess.
    'What do you mean by that?' asked the nurse, who thought she was making  fun.
    'I mean that I've been a long way up and up to see My GREAT  grandmother.
  Ah, nursie, you don't know what a beautiful mother of  grandmothers I've got upstairs.
  She is such an old lady, with such  lovely white hair--as white as my silver cup.
  Now, when I think of it,  I think her hair must be silver.
'    'What nonsense you are talking, princess!' said the nurse.
    'I'm not talking nonsense,' returned Irene, rather offended.
  'I will  tell you all about her.
  She's much taller than you, and much prettier.
'    'Oh, I dare say!' remarked the nurse.
    'And she lives upon pigeons' eggs.
'    'Most likely,' said the nurse.
    'And she sits in an empty room, spin-spinning all day long.
'    'Not a doubt of it,' said the nurse.
    'And she keeps her crown in her bedroom.
'    'Of course--quite the proper place to keep her crown in.
  She wears it  in bed, I'll be bound.
'    'She didn't say that.
  And I don't think she does.
  That wouldn't be  comfortable--would it?  I don't think my papa wears his crown for a  night-cap.
  Does he, nursie?'    'I never asked him.
  I dare say he does.
'    'And she's been there ever since I came here--ever so many years.
'    'Anybody could have told you that,' said the nurse, who did not believe  a word Irene was saying.
    'Why didn't you tell me, then?'    'There was no necessity.
  You could make it all up for yourself.
'    'You don't believe me, then!' exclaimed the princess, astonished and  angry, as she well might be.
    'Did you expect me to believe you, princess?' asked the nurse coldly.
  'I know princesses are in the habit of telling make-believes, but you  are the first I ever heard of who expected to have them believed,' she  added, seeing that the child was strangely in earnest.
    The princess burst into tears.
    'Well, I must say,' remarked the nurse, now thoroughly vexed with her  for crying, 'it is not at all becoming in a princess to tell stories  and expect to be believed just because she is a princess.
'    'But it's quite true, I tell you.
'    'You've dreamt it, then, child.
'    'No, I didn't dream it.
  I went upstairs, and I lost myself, and if I  hadn't found the beautiful lady, I should never have found myself.
'    'Oh, I dare say!'    'Well, you just come up with me, and see if I'm not telling the truth.
'    'Indeed I have other work to do.
  It's your dinnertime, and I won't  have any more such nonsense.
'    The princess wiped her eyes, and her face grew so hot that they were  soon quite dry.
  She sat down to her dinner, but ate next to nothing.
  Not to be believed does not at all agree with princesses: for a real  princess cannot tell a lie.
  So all the afternoon she did not speak a  word.
  Only when the nurse spoke to her, she answered her, for a real  princess is never rude--even when she does well to be offended.
    Of course the nurse was not comfortable in her mind--not that she  suspected the least truth in Irene's story, but that she loved her  dearly, and was vexed with herself for having been cross to her.
 She  thought her crossness was the cause of the princess's unhappiness, and  had no idea that she was really and deeply hurt at not being believed.
  But, as it became more and more plain during the evening in her every  motion and look, that, although she tried to amuse herself with her  toys, her heart was too vexed and troubled to enjoy them, her nurse's  discomfort grew and grew.
  When bedtime came, she undressed and laid  her down, but the child, instead of holding up her little mouth to be  kissed, turned away from her and lay still.
  Then nursie's heart gave  way altogether, and she began to cry.
  At the sound of her first sob  the princess turned again, and held her face to kiss her as usual.
  But  the nurse had her handkerchief to her eyes, and did not see the  movement.
    'Nursie,' said the princess, 'why won't you believe me?'    'Because I can't believe you,' said the nurse, getting angry again.
    'Ah! then, you can't help it,' said Irene, 'and I will not be vexed  with you any more.
  I will give you a kiss and go to sleep.
'    'You little angel!' cried the nurse, and caught her out of bed, and  walked about the room with her in her arms, kissing and hugging her.
    'You will let me take you to see my dear old great big grandmother,  won't you?' said the princess, as she laid her down again.
    'And you won't say I'm ugly, any more--will you, princess?' 'Nursie, I  never said you were ugly.
  What can you mean?'    'Well, if you didn't say it, you meant it.
'    'Indeed, I never did.
'    'You said I wasn't so pretty as that--'    'As my beautiful grandmother--yes, I did say that; and I say it again,  for it's quite true.
'    'Then I do think you are unkind!' said the nurse, and put her  handkerchief to her eyes again.
    'Nursie, dear, everybody can't be as beautiful as every other body, you  know.
  You are very nice-looking, but if you had been as beautiful as  my grandmother--'    'Bother your grandmother!' said the nurse.
    'Nurse, that's very rude.
  You are not fit to be spoken to till you can  behave better.
'    The princess turned away once more, and again the nurse was ashamed of  herself.
    'I'm sure I beg your pardon, princess,' she said, though still in an  offended tone.
  But the princess let the tone pass, and heeded only the  words.
    'You won't say it again, I am sure,' she answered, once more turning  towards her nurse.
  'I was only going to say that if you had been twice  as nice-looking as you are, some king or other would have married you,  and then what would have become of me?'    'You are an angel!' repeated the nurse, again embracing her.
 'Now,'  insisted Irene, 'you will come and see my grandmother--won't you?'    'I will go with you anywhere you like, my cherub,' she answered; and in  two minutes the weary little princess was fast asleep.
            The Princess Lets Well Alone    When she woke the next morning, the first thing she heard was the rain  still falling.
  Indeed, this day was so like the last that it would  have been difficult to tell where was the use of It.
  The first thing  she thought of, however, was not the rain, but the lady in the tower;  and the first question that occupied her thoughts was whether she  should not ask the nurse to fulfil her promise this very morning, and  go with her to find her grandmother as soon as she had had her  breakfast.
  But she came to the conclusion that perhaps the lady would  not be pleased if she took anyone to see her without first asking  leave; especially as it was pretty evident, seeing she lived on  pigeons' eggs, and cooked them herself, that she did not want the  household to know she was there.
  So the princess resolved to take the  first opportunity of running up alone and asking whether she might  bring her nurse.
  She believed the fact that she could not otherwise  convince her she was telling the truth would have much weight with her  grandmother.
    The princess and her nurse were the best of friends all dressing-time,  and the princess in consequence ate an enormous little breakfast.
    'I wonder, Lootie'--that was her pet name for her nurse--'what pigeons'  eggs taste like?' she said, as she was eating her egg--not quite a  common one, for they always picked out the pinky ones for her.
    'We'll get you a pigeon's egg, and you shall judge for yourself,' said  the nurse.
    'Oh, no, no!' returned Irene, suddenly reflecting they might disturb  the old lady in getting it, and that even if they did not, she would  have one less in consequence.
    'What a strange creature you are,' said the nurse--'first to want a  thing and then to refuse it!'    But she did not say it crossly, and the princess never minded any  remarks that were not unfriendly.
    'Well, you see, Lootie, there are reasons,' she returned, and said no  more, for she did not want to bring up the subject of their former  strife, lest her nurse should offer to go before she had had her  grandmother's permission to bring her.
  Of course she could refuse to  take her, but then she would believe her less than ever.
    Now the nurse, as she said herself afterwards, could not be every  moment in the room; and as never before yesterday had the princess  given her the smallest reason for anxiety, it had not yet come into her  head to watch her more closely.
  So she soon gave her a chance, and,  the very first that offered, Irene was off and up the stairs again.
    This day's adventure, however, did not turn out like yesterday's,  although it began like it; and indeed to-day is very seldom like  yesterday, if people would note the differences--even when it rains.
  The princess ran through passage after passage, and could not find the  stair of the tower.
  My own suspicion is that she had not gone up high  enough, and was searching on the second instead of the third floor.
  When she turned to go back, she failed equally in her search after the  stair.
  She was lost once more.
    Something made it even worse to bear this time, and it was no wonder  that she cried again.
  Suddenly it occurred to her that it was after  having cried before that she had found her grandmother's stair.
  She  got up at once, wiped her eyes, and started upon a fresh quest.
    This time, although she did not find what she hoped, she found what was  next best: she did not come on a stair that went up, but she came upon  one that went down.
  It was evidently not the stair she had come up,  yet it was a good deal better than none; so down she went, and was  singing merrily before she reached the bottom.
 There, to her surprise,  she found herself in the kitchen.
  Although she was not allowed to go  there alone, her nurse had often taken her, and she was a great  favourite with the servants.
  So there was a general rush at her the  moment she appeared, for every one wanted to have her; and the report  of where she was soon reached the nurse's ears.
  She came at once to  fetch her; but she never suspected how she had got there, and the  princess kept her own counsel.
    Her failure to find the old lady not only disappointed her, but made  her very thoughtful.
  Sometimes she came almost to the nurse's opinion  that she had dreamed all about her; but that fancy never lasted very  long.
  She wondered much whether she should ever see her again, and  thought it very sad not to have been able to find her when she  particularly wanted her.
  She resolved to say nothing more to her nurse  on the subject, seeing it was so little in her power to prove her words.
            The Little Miner    The next day the great cloud still hung over the mountain, and the rain  poured like water from a full sponge.
  The princess was very fond of  being out of doors, and she nearly cried when she saw that the weather  was no better.
  But the mist was not of such a dark dingy grey; there  was light in it; and as the hours went on it grew brighter and  brighter, until it was almost too brilliant to look at; and late in the  afternoon the sun broke out so gloriously that Irene clapped her hands,  crying:    'See, see, Lootie!  The sun has had his face washed.
  Look how bright  he is!  Do get my hat, and let us go out for a walk.
  Oh, dear! oh,  dear! how happy I am!'    Lootie was very glad to please the princess.
  She got her hat and  cloak, and they set out together for a walk up the mountain; for the  road was so hard and steep that the water could not rest upon it, and  it was always dry enough for walking a few minutes after the rain  ceased.
  The clouds were rolling away in broken pieces, like great,  overwoolly sheep, whose wool the sun had bleached till it was almost  too white for the eyes to bear.
  Between them the sky shone with a  deeper and purer blue, because of the rain.
  The trees on the roadside  were hung all over with drops, which sparkled in the sun like jewels.
  The only things that were no brighter for the rain were the brooks that  ran down the mountain; they had changed from the clearness of crystal  to a muddy brown; but what they lost in colour they gained in sound--or  at least in noise, for a brook when it is swollen is not so musical as  before.
  But Irene was in raptures with the great brown streams  tumbling down everywhere; and Lootie shared in her delight, for she too  had been confined to the house for three days.
    At length she observed that the sun was getting low, and said it was  time to be going back.
  She made the remark again and again, but, every  time, the princess begged her to go on just a little farther and a  little farther; reminding her that it was much easier to go downhill,  and saying that when they did turn they would be at home in a moment.
  So on and on they did go, now to look at a group of ferns over whose  tops a stream was pouring in a watery arch, now to pick a shining stone  from a rock by the wayside, now to watch the flight of some bird.
  Suddenly the shadow of a great mountain peak came up from behind, and  shot in front of them.
  When the nurse saw it, she started and shook,  and catching hold of the princess's hand turned and began to run down  the hill.
    'What's all the haste, nursie?' asked Irene, running alongside of her.
    'We must not be out a moment longer.
'    'But we can't help being out a good many moments longer.
'    It was too true.
  The nurse almost cried.
  They were much too far from  home.
  It was against express orders to be out with the princess one  moment after the sun was down; and they were nearly a mile up the  mountain!  If His Majesty, Irene's papa, were to hear of it, Lootie  would certainly be dismissed; and to leave the princess would break her  heart.
  It was no wonder she ran.
  But Irene was not in the least  frightened, not knowing anything to be frightened at.
  She kept on  chattering as well as she could, but it was not easy.
    'Lootie! Lootie! why do you run so fast?  It shakes my teeth when I  talk.
'    'Then don't talk,' said Lootie.
    'But the princess went on talking.
  She was always saying: 'Look, look,  Lootie!' but Lootie paid no more heed to anything she said, only ran on.
    'Look, look, Lootie!  Don't you see that funny man peeping over the  rock?'    Lootie only ran the faster.
  They had to pass the rock, and when they  came nearer, the princess saw it was only a lump of the rock itself  that she had taken for a man.
    'Look, look, Lootie!  There's such a curious creature at the foot of  that old tree.
  Look at it, Lootie!  It's making faces at us, I do  think.
'    Lootie gave a stifled cry, and ran faster still--so fast that Irene's  little legs could not keep up with her, and she fell with a crash.
  It  was a hard downhill road, and she had been running very fast--so it was  no wonder she began to cry.
  This put the nurse nearly beside herself;  but all she could do was to run on, the moment she got the princess on  her feet again.
    'Who's that laughing at me?' said the princess, trying to keep in her  sobs, and running too fast for her grazed knees.
    'Nobody, child,' said the nurse, almost angrily.
    But that instant there came a burst of coarse tittering from somewhere  near, and a hoarse indistinct voice that seemed to say: 'Lies! lies!  lies!'    'Oh!' cried the nurse with a sigh that was almost a scream, and ran on  faster than ever.
    'Nursie! Lootie! I can't run any more.
  Do let us walk a bit.
'    'What am I to do?' said the nurse.
  'Here, I will carry you.
'    She caught her up; but found her much too heavy to run with, and had to  set her down again.
  Then she looked wildly about her, gave a great  cry, and said:    'We've taken the wrong turning somewhere, and I don't know where we  are.
  We are lost, lost!'    The terror she was in had quite bewildered her.
  It was true enough  they had lost the way.
  They had been running down into a little valley  in which there was no house to be seen.
    Now Irene did not know what good reason there was for her nurse's  terror, for the servants had all strict orders never to mention the  goblins to her, but it was very discomposing to see her nurse in such a  fright.
  Before, however, she had time to grow thoroughly alarmed like  her, she heard the sound of whistling, and that revived her.
  Presently  she saw a boy coming up the road from the valley to meet them.
  He was  the whistler; but before they met his whistling changed to singing.
  And this is something like what he sang:      'Ring! dod! bang!    Go the hammers' clang!    Hit and turn and bore!    Whizz and puff and roar!    Thus we rive the rocks,    Force the goblin locks.
--    See the shining ore!    One, two, three--    Bright as gold can be!    Four, five, six--    Shovels, mattocks, picks!    Seven, eight, nine--    Light your lamp at mine.
    Ten, eleven, twelve--    Loosely hold the helve.
    We're the merry miner-boys,    Make the goblins hold their noise.
'      'I wish YOU would hold your noise,' said the nurse rudely, for the very  word GOBLIN at such a time and in such a place made her tremble.
  It  would bring the goblins upon them to a certainty, she thought, to defy  them in that way.
  But whether the boy heard her or not, he did not  stop his singing.
        'Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen--    This is worth the siftin';    Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen--    There's the match, and lay't in.
    Nineteen, twenty--    Goblins in a plenty.
'      'Do be quiet,' cried the nurse, in a whispered shriek.
  But the boy,  who was now close at hand, still went on.
      'Hush! scush! scurry!    There you go in a hurry!    Gobble! gobble! goblin!    There you go a wobblin';    Hobble, hobble, hobblin'--    Cobble! cobble! cobblin'!    Hob-bob-goblin!--    Huuuuuh!'      'There!' said the boy, as he stood still opposite them.
  'There!  that'll do for them.
  They can't bear singing, and they can't stand  that song.
  They can't sing themselves, for they have no more voice  than a crow; and they don't like other people to sing.
'    The boy was dressed in a miner's dress, with a curious cap on his head.
  He was a very nice-looking boy, with eyes as dark as the mines in which  he worked and as sparkling as the crystals in their rocks.
  He was  about twelve years old.
  His face was almost too pale for beauty, which  came of his being so little in the open air and the sunlight--for even  vegetables grown in the dark are white; but he looked happy, merry  indeed--perhaps at the thought of having routed the goblins; and his  bearing as he stood before them had nothing clownish or rude about it.
    'I saw them,' he went on, 'as I came up; and I'm very glad I did.
 I  knew they were after somebody, but I couldn't see who it was.
 They  won't touch you so long as I'm with you.
'    'Why, who are you?' asked the nurse, offended at the freedom with which  he spoke to them.
    'I'm Peter's son.
'    'Who's Peter?'    'Peter the miner.
'    'I don't know him.
' 'I'm his son, though.
'    'And why should the goblins mind you, pray?'    'Because I don't mind them.
  I'm used to them.
'    'What difference does that make?'    'If you're not afraid of them, they're afraid of you.
  I'm not afraid  of them.
  That's all.
  But it's all that's wanted--up here, that is.
  It's a different thing down there.
  They won't always mind that song  even, down there.
  And if anyone sings it, they stand grinning at him  awfully; and if he gets frightened, and misses a word, or says a wrong  one, they--oh! don't they give it him!'    'What do they do to him?' asked Irene, with a trembling voice.
    'Don't go frightening the princess,' said the nurse.
    'The princess!' repeated the little miner, taking off his curious cap.
  'I beg your pardon; but you oughtn't to be out so late.
 Everybody knows  that's against the law.
'    'Yes, indeed it is!' said the nurse, beginning to cry again.
  'And I  shall have to suffer for it.
'    'What does that matter?' said the boy.
  'It must be your fault.
  It is  the princess who will suffer for it.
  I hope they didn't hear you call  her the princess.
  If they did, they're sure to know her again: they're  awfully sharp.
'    'Lootie! Lootie!' cried the princess.
  'Take me home.
'    'Don't go on like that,' said the nurse to the boy, almost fiercely.
  'How could I help it?  I lost my way.
'    'You shouldn't have been out so late.
  You wouldn't have lost your way  if you hadn't been frightened,' said the boy.
  'Come along.
 I'll soon  set you right again.
  Shall I carry your little Highness?'    'Impertinence!' murmured the nurse, but she did not say it aloud, for  she thought if she made him angry he might take his revenge by telling  someone belonging to the house, and then it would be sure to come to  the king's ears.
  'No, thank you,' said Irene.
  'I can walk very well,  though I can't run so fast as nursie.
  If you will give me one hand,  Lootie will give me another, and then I shall get on famously.
'    They soon had her between them, holding a hand of each.
    'Now let's run,' said the nurse.
    'No, no!' said the little miner.
  'That's the worst thing you can do.
  If you hadn't run before, you would not have lost your way.
 And if you  run now, they will be after you in a moment.
'    'I don't want to run,' said Irene.
    'You don't think of me,' said the nurse.
    'Yes, I do, Lootie.
  The boy says they won't touch us if we don't run.
'    'Yes, but if they know at the house that I've kept you out so late I  shall be turned away, and that would break my heart.
'    'Turned away, Lootie!  Who would turn you away?'    'Your papa, child.
'    'But I'll tell him it was all my fault.
  And you know it was, Lootie.
'    'He won't mind that.
  I'm sure he won't.
'    'Then I'll cry, and go down on my knees to him, and beg him not to take  away my own dear Lootie.
'    The nurse was comforted at hearing this, and said no more.
  They went  on, walking pretty fast, but taking care not to run a step.
    'I want to talk to you,' said Irene to the little miner; 'but it's so  awkward!  I don't know your name.
'    'My name's Curdie, little princess.
'    'What a funny name! Curdie!  What more?'    'Curdie Peterson.
  What's your name, please?'    'Irene.
'    'What more?'    'I don't know what more.
  What more is my name, Lootie?'    'Princesses haven't got more than one name.
  They don't want it.
'    'Oh, then, Curdie, you must call me just Irene and no more.
'    'No, indeed,' said the nurse indignantly.
  'He shall do no such thing.
'    'What shall he call me, then, Lootie?'    'Your Royal Highness.
' 'My Royal Highness!  What's that?  No, no,  Lootie.
  I won't be called names.
  I don't like them.
  You told me once  yourself it's only rude children that call names; and I'm sure Curdie  wouldn't be rude.
  Curdie, my name's Irene.
'    'Well, Irene,' said Curdie, with a glance at the nurse which showed he  enjoyed teasing her; 'it is very kind of you to let me call you  anything.
  I like your name very much.
'    He expected the nurse to interfere again; but he soon saw that she was  too frightened to speak.
  She was staring at something a few yards  before them in the middle of the path, where it narrowed between rocks  so that only one could pass at a time.
    'It is very much kinder of you to go out of your way to take us home,'  said Irene.
    'I'm not going out of my way yet,' said Curdie.
  'It's on the other  side of those rocks the path turns off to my father's.
'    'You wouldn't think of leaving us till we're safe home, I'm sure,'  gasped the nurse.
    'Of course not,' said Curdie.
    'You dear, good, kind Curdie!  I'll give you a kiss when we get home,'  said the princess.
    The nurse gave her a great pull by the hand she held.
  But at that  instant the something in the middle of the way, which had looked like a  great lump of earth brought down by the rain, began to move.
 One after  another it shot out four long things, like two arms and two legs, but  it was now too dark to tell what they were.
  The nurse began to tremble  from head to foot.
  Irene clasped Curdie's hand yet faster, and Curdie  began to sing again:      'One, two--    Hit and hew!    Three, four--    Blast and bore!    Five, six--    There's a fix!    Seven, eight--    Hold it straight!    Nine, ten--    Hit again!    Hurry! scurry!    Bother! smother!    There's a toad    In the road!    Smash it!    Squash it!    Fry it!    Dry it!    You're another!    Up and off!    There's enough!--    Huuuuuh!'      As he uttered the last words, Curdie let go his hold of his companion,  and rushed at the thing in the road as if he would trample it under his  feet.
  It gave a great spring, and ran straight up one of the rocks  like a huge spider.
  Curdie turned back laughing, and took Irene's hand  again.
  She grasped his very tight, but said nothing till they had  passed the rocks.
  A few yards more and she found herself on a part of  the road she knew, and was able to speak again.
    'Do you know, Curdie, I don't quite like your song: it sounds to me  rather rude,' she said.
    'Well, perhaps it is,' answered Curdie.
  'I never thought of that; it's  a way we have.
  We do it because they don't like it.
'    'Who don't like it?'    'The cobs, as we call them.
'    'Don't!' said the nurse.
    'Why not?' said Curdie.
    'I beg you won't.
  Please don't.
'    'Oh! if you ask me that way, of course, I won't; though I don't a bit  know why.
  Look! there are the lights of your great house down below.
  You'll be at home in five minutes now.
'    Nothing more happened.
  They reached home in safety.
  Nobody had missed  them, or even known they had gone out; and they arrived at the door  belonging to their part of the house without anyone seeing them.
  The  nurse was rushing in with a hurried and not over-gracious good night to  Curdie; but the princess pulled her hand from hers, and was just  throwing her arms round Curdie's neck, when she caught her again and  dragged her away.
    'Lootie! Lootie! I promised a kiss,' cried Irene.
    'A princess mustn't give kisses.
  It's not at all proper,' said Lootie.
    'But I promised,' said the princess.
    'There's no occasion; he's only a miner-boy.
'    'He's a good boy, and a brave boy, and he has been very kind to us.
  Lootie! Lootie! I promised.
'    'Then you shouldn't have promised.
'    'Lootie, I promised him a kiss.
'    'Your Royal Highness,' said Lootie, suddenly grown very respectful,  'must come in directly.
'    'Nurse, a princess must not break her word,' said Irene, drawing  herself up and standing stock-still.
    Lootie did not know which the king might count the worst--to let the  princess be out after sunset, or to let her kiss a miner-boy.
 She did  not know that, being a gentleman, as many kings have been, he would  have counted neither of them the worse.
  However much he might have  disliked his daughter to kiss the miner-boy, he would not have had her  break her word for all the goblins in creation.
 But, as I say, the  nurse was not lady enough to understand this, and so she was in a great  difficulty, for, if she insisted, someone might hear the princess cry  and run to see, and then all would come out.
  But here Curdie came  again to the rescue.
    'Never mind, Princess Irene,' he said.
  'You mustn't kiss me tonight.
  But you shan't break your word.
  I will come another time.
  You may be  sure I will.
'    'Oh, thank you, Curdie!' said the princess, and stopped crying.
    'Good night, Irene; good night, Lootie,' said Curdie, and turned and  was out of sight in a moment.
    'I should like to see him!' muttered the nurse, as she carried the  princess to the nursery.
    'You will see him,' said Irene.
  'You may be sure Curdie will keep his  word.
  He's sure to come again.
'    'I should like to see him!' repeated the nurse, and said no more.
 She  did not want to open a new cause of strife with the princess by saying  more plainly what she meant.
  Glad enough that she had succeeded both  in getting home unseen, and in keeping the princess from kissing the  miner's boy, she resolved to watch her far better in future.
  Her  carelessness had already doubled the danger she was in.
  Formerly the  goblins were her only fear; now she had to protect her charge from  Curdie as well.
            The Mines    Curdie went home whistling.
  He resolved to say nothing about the  princess for fear of getting the nurse into trouble, for while he  enjoyed teasing her because of her absurdity, he was careful not to do  her any harm.
  He saw no more of the goblins, and was soon fast asleep  in his bed.
    He woke in the middle of the night, and thought he heard curious noises  outside.
  He sat up and listened; then got up, and, opening the door  very quietly, went out.
  When he peeped round the corner, he saw, under  his own window, a group of stumpy creatures, whom he at once recognized  by their shape.
  Hardly, however, had he begun his 'One, two, three!'  when they broke asunder, scurried away, and were out of sight.
  He  returned laughing, got into bed again, and was fast asleep in a moment.
    Reflecting a little over the matter in the morning, he came to the  conclusion that, as nothing of the kind had ever happened before, they  must be annoyed with him for interfering to protect the princess.
  By  the time he was dressed, however, he was thinking of something quite  different, for he did not value the enmity of the goblins in the least.
  As soon as they had had breakfast, he set off with his father for the  mine.
    They entered the hill by a natural opening under a huge rock, where a  little stream rushed out.
  They followed its course for a few yards,  when the passage took a turn, and sloped steeply into the heart of the  hill.
  With many angles and windings and branchings-off, and sometimes  with steps where it came upon a natural gulf, it led them deep into the  hill before they arrived at the place where they were at present  digging out the precious ore.
 This was of various kinds, for the  mountain was very rich in the better sorts of metals.
  With flint and  steel, and tinder-box, they lighted their lamps, then fixed them on  their heads, and were soon hard at work with their pickaxes and shovels  and hammers.
  Father and son were at work near each other, but not in  the same gang--the passages out of which the ore was dug, they called  gangs--for when the lode, or vein of ore, was small, one miner would  have to dig away alone in a passage no bigger than gave him just room  to work--sometimes in uncomfortable cramped positions.
  If they stopped  for a moment they could hear everywhere around them, some nearer, some  farther off, the sounds of their companions burrowing away in all  directions in the inside of the great mountain--some boring holes in  the rock in order to blow it up with gunpowder, others shovelling the  broken ore into baskets to be carried to the mouth of the mine, others  hitting away with their pickaxes.
 Sometimes, if the miner was in a very  lonely part, he would hear only a tap-tapping, no louder than that of a  woodpecker, for the sound would come from a great distance off through  the solid mountain rock.
    The work was hard at best, for it is very warm underground; but it was  not particularly unpleasant, and some of the miners, when they wanted  to earn a little more money for a particular purpose, would stop behind  the rest and work all night.
  But you could not tell night from day  down there, except from feeling tired and sleepy; for no light of the  sun ever came into those gloomy regions.
  Some who had thus remained  behind during the night, although certain there were none of their  companions at work, would declare the next morning that they heard,  every time they halted for a moment to take breath, a tap-tapping all  about them, as if the mountain were then more full of miners than ever  it was during the day; and some in consequence would never stay  overnight, for all knew those were the sounds of the goblins.
  They  worked only at night, for the miners' night was the goblins' day.
  Indeed, the greater number of the miners were afraid of the goblins;  for there were strange stories well known amongst them of the treatment  some had received whom the goblins had surprised at their work during  the night.
  The more courageous of them, however, amongst them Peter  Peterson and Curdie, who in this took after his father, had stayed in  the mine all night again and again, and although they had several times  encountered a few stray goblins, had never yet failed in driving them  away.
  As I have indicated already, the chief defence against them was  verse, for they hated verse of every kind, and some kinds they could  not endure at all.
  I suspect they could not make any themselves, and  that was why they disliked it so much.
  At all events, those who were  most afraid of them were those who could neither make verses themselves  nor remember the verses that other people made for them; while those  who were never afraid were those who could make verses for themselves;  for although there were certain old rhymes which were very effectual,  yet it was well known that a new rhyme, if of the right sort, was even  more distasteful to them, and therefore more effectual in putting them  to flight.
    Perhaps my readers may be wondering what the goblins could be about,  working all night long, seeing they never carried up the ore and sold  it; but when I have informed them concerning what Curdie learned the  very next night, they will be able to understand.
    For Curdie had determined, if his father would permit him, to remain  there alone this night--and that for two reasons: first, he wanted to  get extra wages that he might buy a very warm red petticoat for his  mother, who had begun to complain of the cold of the mountain air  sooner than usual this autumn; and second, he had just a faint hope of  finding out what the goblins were about under his window the night  before.
    When he told his father, he made no objection, for he had great  confidence in his boy's courage and resources.
    'I'm sorry I can't stay with you,' said Peter; 'but I want to go and  pay the parson a visit this evening, and besides I've had a bit of a  headache all day.
'    'I'm sorry for that, father,' said Curdie.
    'Oh, it's not much.
  You'll be sure to take care of yourself, won't  you?'    'Yes, father; I will.
  I'll keep a sharp look-out, I promise you.
'  Curdie was the only one who remained in the mine.
  About six o'clock  the rest went away, everyone bidding him good night, and telling him to  take care of himself; for he was a great favourite with them all.
    'Don't forget your rhymes,' said one.
    'No, no,'answered Curdie.
    'It's no matter if he does,' said another, 'for he'll only have to make  a new one.
'    'Yes: but he mightn't be able to make it fast enough,' said another;  'and while it was cooking in his head, they might take a mean advantage  and set upon him.
'    'I'll do my best,' said Curdie.
  'I'm not afraid.
' 'We all know that,'  they returned, and left him.
            The Goblins    For some time Curdie worked away briskly, throwing all the ore he had  disengaged on one side behind him, to be ready for carrying out in the  morning.
  He heard a good deal of goblin-tapping, but it all sounded  far away in the hill, and he paid it little heed.
  Towards midnight he  began to feel rather hungry; so he dropped his pickaxe, got out a lump  of bread which in the morning he had laid in a damp hole in the rock,  sat down on a heap of ore, and ate his supper.
 Then he leaned back for  five minutes' rest before beginning his work again, and laid his head  against the rock.
  He had not kept the position for one minute before  he heard something which made him sharpen his ears.
  It sounded like a  voice inside the rock.
 After a while he heard it again.
  It was a  goblin voice--there could be no doubt about that--and this time he  could make out the words.
    'Hadn't we better be moving?'it said.
    A rougher and deeper voice replied:    'There's no hurry.
  That wretched little mole won't be through tonight,  if he work ever so hard.
  He's not by any means at the thinnest place.
'    'But you still think the lode does come through into our house?' said  the first voice.
    'Yes, but a good bit farther on than he has got to yet.
  If he had  struck a stroke more to the side just here,' said the goblin, tapping  the very stone, as it seemed to Curdie, against which his head lay, 'he  would have been through; but he's a couple of yards past it now, and if  he follow the lode it will be a week before it leads him in.
  You see  it back there--a long way.
  Still, perhaps, in case of accident it  would be as well to be getting out of this.
 Helfer, you'll take the  great chest.
  That's your business, you know.
'    'Yes, dad,' said a third voice.
  'But you must help me to get it on my  back.
  It's awfully heavy, you know.
'    'Well, it isn't just a bag of smoke, I admit.
  But you're as strong as  a mountain, Helfer.
'    'You say so, dad.
  I think myself I'm all right.
  But I could carry ten  times as much if it wasn't for my feet.
'    'That is your weak point, I confess, my boy.
' 'Ain't it yours too,  father?'    'Well, to be honest, it's a goblin weakness.
  Why they come so soft, I  declare I haven't an idea.
'    'Specially when your head's so hard, you know, father.
'    'Yes my boy.
  The goblin's glory is his head.
  To think how the fellows  up above there have to put on helmets and things when they go fighting!  Ha! ha!'    'But why don't we wear shoes like them, father?  I should like  it--especially when I've got a chest like that on my head.
'    'Well, you see, it's not the fashion.
  The king never wears shoes.
'    'The queen does.
'    'Yes; but that's for distinction.
  The first queen, you see--I mean the  king's first wife--wore shoes, of course, because she came from  upstairs; and so, when she died, the next queen would not be inferior  to her as she called it, and would wear shoes too.
  It was all pride.
  She is the hardest in forbidding them to the rest of the women.
'    'I'm sure I wouldn't wear them--no, not for--that I wouldn't!' said the  first voice, which was evidently that of the mother of the family.
  'I  can't think why either of them should.
'    'Didn't I tell you the first was from upstairs?' said the other.
 'That  was the only silly thing I ever knew His Majesty guilty of.
 Why should  he marry an outlandish woman like that-one of our natural enemies too?'    'I suppose he fell in love with her.
' 'Pooh! pooh!  He's just as happy  now with one of his own people.
'    'Did she die very soon?  They didn't tease her to death, did they?'    'Oh, dear, no!  The king worshipped her very footmarks.
'    'What made her die, then?  Didn't the air agree with her?'    'She died when the young prince was born.
'    'How silly of her!  We never do that.
  It must have been because she  wore shoes.
'    'I don't know that.
'    'Why do they wear shoes up there?'    'Ah, now that's a sensible question, and I will answer it.
  But in  order to do so, I must first tell you a secret.
  I once saw the queen's  feet.
'    'Without her shoes?'    'Yes--without her shoes.
'    'No!  Did you?  How was it?'    'Never you mind how it was.
  She didn't know I saw them.
  And what do  you think!--they had toes!'    'Toes!  What's that?'    'You may well ask!  I should never have known if I had not seen the  queen's feet.
  Just imagine! the ends of her feet were split up into  five or six thin pieces!'    'Oh, horrid!  How could the king have fallen in love with her?'    'You forget that she wore shoes.
  That is just why she wore them.
 That  is why all the men, and women too, upstairs wear shoes.
  They can't  bear the sight of their own feet without them.
'    'Ah! now I understand.
  If ever you wish for shoes again, Helfer, I'll  hit your feet--I will.
'    'No, no, mother; pray don't.
'    'Then don't you.
'    'But with such a big box on my head--'    A horrid scream followed, which Curdie interpreted as in reply to a  blow from his mother upon the feet of her eldest goblin.
    'Well, I never knew so much before!' remarked a fourth voice.
    'Your knowledge is not universal quite yet,' said the father.
  'You  were only fifty last month.
  Mind you see to the bed and bedding.
 As  soon as we've finished our supper, we'll be up and going.
  Ha! ha! ha!'    'What are you laughing at, husband?'    'I'm laughing to think what a mess the miners will find themselves  in--somewhere before this day ten years.
'    'Why, what do you mean?'    'Oh, nothing.
'    'Oh, yes, you do mean something.
  You always do mean something.
'    'It's more than you do, then, wife.
' 'That may be; but it's not more  than I find out, you know.
'    'Ha! ha!  You're a sharp one.
  What a mother you've got, Helfer!'    'Yes, father.
'    'Well, I suppose I must tell you.
  They're all at the palace consulting  about it tonight; and as soon as we've got away from this thin place  I'm going there to hear what night they fix upon.
 I should like to see  that young ruffian there on the other side, struggling in the agonies  of--'    He dropped his voice so low that Curdie could hear only a growl.
 The  growl went on in the low bass for a good while, as inarticulate as if  the goblin's tongue had been a sausage; and it was not until his wife  spoke again that it rose to its former pitch.
    'But what shall we do when you are at the palace?' she asked.
    'I will see you safe in the new house I've been digging for you for the  last two months.
  Podge, you mind the table and chairs.
  I commit them  to your care.
  The table has seven legs--each chair three.
  I shall  require them all at your hands.
'    After this arose a confused conversation about the various household  goods and their transport; and Curdie heard nothing more that was of  any importance.
    He now knew at least one of the reasons for the constant sound of the  goblin hammers and pickaxes at night.
  They were making new houses for  themselves, to which they might retreat when the miners should threaten  to break into their dwellings.
  But he had learned two things of far  greater importance.
  The first was, that some grievous calamity was  preparing, and almost ready to fall upon the heads of the miners; the  second was--the one weak point of a goblin's body; he had not known  that their feet were so tender as he had now reason to suspect.
  He had  heard it said that they had no toes: he had never had opportunity of  inspecting them closely enough, in the dusk in which they always  appeared, to satisfy himself whether it was a correct report.
  Indeed,  he had not been able even to satisfy himself as to whether they had no  fingers, although that also was commonly said to be the fact.
  One of  the miners, indeed, who had had more schooling than the rest, was wont  to argue that such must have been the primordial condition of humanity,  and that education and handicraft had developed both toes and  fingers--with which proposition Curdie had once heard his father  sarcastically agree, alleging in support of it the probability that  babies' gloves were a traditional remnant of the old state of things;  while the stockings of all ages, no regard being paid in them to the  toes, pointed in the same direction.
  But what was of importance was  the fact concerning the softness of the goblin feet, which he foresaw  might be useful to all miners.
  What he had to do in the meantime,  however, was to discover, if possible, the special evil design the  goblins had now in their heads.
    Although he knew all the gangs and all the natural galleries with which  they communicated in the mined part of the mountain, he had not the  least idea where the palace of the king of the gnomes was; otherwise he  would have set out at once on the enterprise of discovering what the  said design was.
  He judged, and rightly, that it must lie in a farther  part of the mountain, between which and the mine there was as yet no  communication.
  There must be one nearly completed, however; for it  could be but a thin partition which now separated them.
  If only he  could get through in time to follow the goblins as they retreated!  A  few blows would doubtless be sufficient--just where his ear now lay;  but if he attempted to strike there with his pickaxe, he would only  hasten the departure of the family, put them on their guard, and  perhaps lose their involuntary guidance.
  He therefore began to feel  the wall With his hands, and soon found that some of the stones were  loose enough to be drawn out with little noise.
    Laying hold of a large one with both his hands, he drew it gently out,  and let it down softly.
    'What was that noise?' said the goblin father.
    Curdie blew out his light, lest it should shine through.
    'It must be that one miner that stayed behind the rest,' said the  mother.
    'No; he's been gone a good while.
  I haven't heard a blow for an hour.
  Besides, it wasn't like that.
'    'Then I suppose it must have been a stone carried down the brook  inside.
'    'Perhaps.
  It will have more room by and by.
'    Curdie kept quite still.
  After a little while, hearing nothing but the  sounds of their preparations for departure, mingled with an occasional  word of direction, and anxious to know whether the removal of the stone  had made an opening into the goblins' house, he put in his hand to  feel.
  It went in a good way, and then came in contact with something  soft.
  He had but a moment to feel it over, it was so quickly  withdrawn: it was one of the toeless goblin feet.
  The owner of it gave  a cry of fright.
    'What's the matter, Helfer?' asked his mother.
    'A beast came out of the wall and licked my foot.
'    'Nonsense!  There are no wild beasts in our country,' said his father.
    'But it was, father.
  I felt it.
'    'Nonsense, I say.
  Will you malign your native realms and reduce them  to a level with the country upstairs?  That is swarming with wild  beasts of every description.
'    'But I did feel it, father.
'    'I tell you to hold your tongue.
  You are no patriot.
'    Curdie suppressed his laughter, and lay still as a mouse--but no  stiller, for every moment he kept nibbling away with his fingers at the  edges of the hole.
  He was slowly making it bigger, for here the rock  had been very much shattered with the blasting.
    There seemed to be a good many in the family, to judge from the mass of  confused talk which now and then came through the hole; but when all  were speaking together, and just as if they had bottle-brushes--each at  least one--in their throats, it was not easy to make out much that was  said.
  At length he heard once more what the father goblin was saying.
    'Now, then,' he said, 'get your bundles on your backs.
  Here, Helfer,  I'll help you up with your chest.
'    'I wish it was my chest, father.
'    'Your turn will come in good time enough!  Make haste.
  I must go to  the meeting at the palace tonight.
  When that's over, we can come back  and clear out the last of the things before our enemies return in the  morning.
  Now light your torches, and come along.
 What a distinction it  is, to provide our own light, instead of being dependent on a thing  hung up in the air--a most disagreeable contrivance--intended no doubt  to blind us when we venture out under its baleful influence!  Quite  glaring and vulgar, I call it, though no doubt useful to poor creatures  who haven't the wit to make light for themselves.
'    Curdie could hardly keep himself from calling through to know whether  they made the fire to light their torches by.
  But a moment's  reflection showed him that they would have said they did, inasmuch as  they struck two stones together, and the fire came.
            The Hall of the Goblin Palace    A sound of many soft feet followed, but soon ceased.
  Then Curdie flew  at the hole like a tiger, and tore and pulled.
  The sides gave way, and  it was soon large enough for him to crawl through.
  He would not betray  himself by rekindling his lamp, but the torches of the retreating  company, which he found departing in a straight line up a long avenue  from the door of their cave, threw back light enough to afford him a  glance round the deserted home of the goblins.
  To his surprise, he  could discover nothing to distinguish it from an ordinary natural cave  in the rock, upon many of which he had come with the rest of the miners  in the progress of their excavations.
  The goblins had talked of coming  back for the rest of their household gear: he saw nothing that would  have made him suspect a family had taken shelter there for a single  night.
  The floor was rough and stony; the walls full of projecting  corners; the roof in one place twenty feet high, in another endangering  his forehead; while on one side a stream, no thicker than a needle, it  is true, but still sufficient to spread a wide dampness over the wall,  flowed down the face of the rock.
  But the troop in front of him was  toiling under heavy burdens.
  He could distinguish Helfer now and then,  in the flickering light and shade, with his heavy chest on his bending  shoulders; while the second brother was almost buried in what looked  like a great feather bed.
  'Where do they get the feathers?' thought  Curdie; but in a moment the troop disappeared at a turn of the way, and  it was now both safe and necessary for Curdie to follow them, lest they  should be round the next turning before he saw them again, for so he  might lose them altogether.
  He darted after them like a greyhound.
  When he reached the corner and looked cautiously round, he saw them  again at some distance down another long passage.
  None of the  galleries he saw that night bore signs of the work of man--or of goblin  either.
  Stalactites, far older than the mines, hung from their roofs;  and their floors were rough with boulders and large round stones,  showing that there water must have once run.
  He waited again at this  corner till they had disappeared round the next, and so followed them a  long way through one passage after another.
  The passages grew more and  more lofty, and were more and more covered in the roof with shining  stalactites.
    It was a strange enough procession which he followed.
  But the  strangest part of it was the household animals which crowded amongst  the feet of the goblins.
  It was true they had no wild animals down  there--at least they did not know of any; but they had a wonderful  number of tame ones.
  I must, however, reserve any contributions  towards the natural history of these for a later position in my story.
    At length, turning a corner too abruptly, he had almost rushed into the  middle of the goblin family; for there they had already set down all  their burdens on the floor of a cave considerably larger than that  which they had left.
  They were as yet too breathless to speak, else he  would have had warning of their arrest.
  He started back, however,  before anyone saw him, and retreating a good way, stood watching till  the father should come out to go to the palace.
    Before very long, both he and his son Helfer appeared and kept on in  the same direction as before, while Curdie followed them again with  renewed precaution.
  For a long time he heard no sound except something  like the rush of a river inside the rock; but at length what seemed the  far-off noise of a great shouting reached his ears, which, however,  presently ceased.
  After advancing a good way farther, he thought he  heard a single voice.
  It sounded clearer and clearer as he went on,  until at last he could almost distinguish the words.
  In a moment or  two, keeping after the goblins round another corner, he once more  started back--this time in amazement.
    He was at the entrance of a magnificent cavern, of an oval shape, once  probably a huge natural reservoir of water, now the great palace hall  of the goblins.
  It rose to a tremendous height, but the roof was  composed of such shining materials, and the multitude of torches  carried by the goblins who crowded the floor lighted up the place so  brilliantly, that Curdie could see to the top quite well.
  But he had  no idea how immense the place was until his eyes had got accustomed to  it, which was not for a good many minutes.
 The rough projections on the  walls, and the shadows thrown upwards from them by the torches, made  the sides of the chamber look as if they were crowded with statues upon  brackets and pedestals, reaching in irregular tiers from floor to roof.
  The walls themselves were, in many parts, of gloriously shining  substances, some of them gorgeously coloured besides, which powerfully  contrasted with the shadows.
  Curdie could not help wondering whether  his rhymes would be of any use against such a multitude of goblins as  filled the floor of the hall, and indeed felt considerably tempted to  begin his shout of 'One, two, three!', but as there was no reason for  routing them and much for endeavouring to discover their designs, he  kept himself perfectly quiet, and peering round the edge of the  doorway, listened with both his sharp ears.
    At the other end of the hall, high above the heads of the multitude,  was a terrace-like ledge of considerable height, caused by the receding  of the upper part of the cavern-wall.
  Upon this sat the king and his  court: the king on a throne hollowed out of a huge block of green  copper ore, and his court upon lower seats around it.
  The king had  been making them a speech, and the applause which followed it was what  Curdie had heard.
  One of the court was now addressing the multitude.
  What he heard him say was to the following effect: 'Hence it appears  that two plans have been for some time together working in the strong  head of His Majesty for the deliverance of his people.
  Regardless of  the fact that we were the first possessors of the regions they now  inhabit; regardless equally of the fact that we abandoned that region  from the loftiest motives; regardless also of the self-evident fact  that we excel them so far in mental ability as they excel us in  stature, they look upon us as a degraded race and make a mockery of all  our finer feelings.
  But, the time has almost arrived when--thanks to  His Majesty's inventive genius--it will be in our power to take a  thorough revenge upon them once for all, in respect of their unfriendly  behaviour.
'    'May it please Your Majesty--' cried a voice close by the door, which  Curdie recognized as that of the goblin he had followed.
    'Who is he that interrupts the Chancellor?' cried another from near the  throne.
    'Glump,' answered several voices.
    'He is our trusty subject,' said the king himself, in a slow and  stately voice: 'let him come forward and speak.
'    A lane was parted through the crowd, and Glump, having ascended the  platform and bowed to the king, spoke as follows:    'Sire, I would have held my peace, had I not known that I only knew how  near was the moment, to which the Chancellor had just referred.
    In all probability, before another day is past, the enemy will have  broken through into my house--the partition between being even now not  more than a foot in thickness.
'    'Not quite so much,' thought Curdie to himself.
    'This very evening I have had to remove my household effects; therefore  the sooner we are ready to carry out the plan, for the execution of  which His Majesty has been making such magnificent preparations, the  better.
  I may just add, that within the last few days I have perceived  a small outbreak in my dining-room, which, combined with observations  upon the course of the river escaping where the evil men enter, has  convinced me that close to the spot must be a deep gulf in its channel.
  This discovery will, I trust, add considerably to the otherwise immense  forces at His Majesty's disposal.
'    He ceased, and the king graciously acknowledged his speech with a bend  of his head; whereupon Glump, after a bow to His Majesty, slid down  amongst the rest of the undistinguished multitude.
  Then the Chancellor  rose and resumed.
    'The information which the worthy Glump has given us,' he said, 'might  have been of considerable import at the present moment, but for that  other design already referred to, which naturally takes precedence.
  His Majesty, unwilling to proceed to extremities, and well aware that  such measures sooner or later result in violent reactions, has  excogitated a more fundamental and comprehensive measure, of which I  need say no more.
  Should His Majesty be successful--as who dares to  doubt?--then a peace, all to the advantage of the goblin kingdom, will  be established for a generation at least, rendered absolutely secure by  the pledge which His Royal Highness the prince will have and hold for  the good behaviour of her relatives.
  Should His Majesty fail--which  who shall dare even to imagine in his most secret thoughts?--then will  be the time for carrying out with rigour the design to which Glump  referred, and for which our preparations are even now all but  completed.
  The failure of the former will render the latter  imperative.
'    Curdie, perceiving that the assembly was drawing to a close and that  there was little chance of either plan being more fully discovered, now  thought it prudent to make his escape before the goblins began to  disperse, and slipped quietly away.
    There was not much danger of meeting any goblins, for all the men at  least were left behind him in the palace; but there was considerable  danger of his taking a wrong turning, for he had now no light, and had  therefore to depend upon his memory and his hands.
  After he had left  behind him the glow that issued from the door of Glump's new abode, he  was utterly without guide, so far as his eyes were concerned.
    He was most anxious to get back through the hole before the goblins  should return to fetch the remains of their furniture.
  It was not that  he was in the least afraid of them, but, as it was of the utmost  importance that he should thoroughly discover what the plans they were  cherishing were, he must not occasion the slightest suspicion that they  were watched by a miner.
    He hurried on, feeling his way along the walls of rock.
  Had he not  been very courageous, he must have been very anxious, for he could not  but know that if he lost his way it would be the most difficult thing  in the world to find it again.
  Morning would bring no light into these  regions; and towards him least of all, who was known as a special  rhymester and persecutor, could goblins be expected to exercise  courtesy.
  Well might he wish that he had brought his lamp and  tinder-box with him, of which he had not thought when he crept so  eagerly after the goblins!  He wished it all the more when, after a  while, he found his way blocked up, and could get no farther.
  It was  of no use to turn back, for he had not the least idea where he had  begun to go wrong.
  Mechanically, however, he kept feeling about the  walls that hemmed him in.
  His hand came upon a place where a tiny  stream of water was running down the face of the rock.
  'What a stupid  I am!' he said to himself.
  'I am actually at the end of my journey!  And there are the goblins coming back to fetch their things!' he added,  as the red glimmer of their torches appeared at the end of the long  avenue that led up to the cave.
  In a moment he had thrown himself on  the floor, and wriggled backwards through the hole.
  The floor on the  other side was several feet lower, which made it easier to get back.
  It was all he could do to lift the largest stone he had taken out of  the hole, but he did manage to shove it in again.
  He sat down on the  ore-heap and thought.
    He was pretty sure that the latter plan of the goblins was to inundate  the mine by breaking outlets for the water accumulated in the natural  reservoirs of the mountain, as well as running through portions of it.
  While the part hollowed by the miners remained shut off from that  inhabited by the goblins, they had had no opportunity of injuring them  thus; but now that a passage was broken through, and the goblins' part  proved the higher in the mountain, it was clear to Curdie that the mine  could be destroyed in an hour.
  Water was always the chief danger to  which the miners were exposed.
  They met with a little choke-damp  sometimes, but never with the explosive firedamp so common in  coal-mines.
  Hence they were careful as soon as they saw any appearance  of water.
 As the result of his reflections while the goblins were busy  in their old home, it seemed to Curdie that it would be best to build  up the whole of this gang, filling it with stone, and clay or lie, so  that there should be no smallest channel for the water to get into.
  There was not, however, any immediate danger, for the execution of the  goblins' plan was contingent upon the failure of that unknown design  which was to take precedence of it; and he was most anxious to keep the  door of communication open, that he might if possible discover what the  former plan was.
  At the same time they could not resume their  intermitted labours for the inundation without his finding it out; when  by putting all hands to the work, the one existing outlet might in a  single night be rendered impenetrable to any weight of water; for by  filling the gang entirely up, their embankment would be buttressed by  the sides of the mountain itself.
    As soon as he found that the goblins had again retired, he lighted his  lamp, and proceeded to fill the hole he had made with such stones as he  could withdraw when he pleased.
  He then thought it better, as he might  have occasion to be up a good many nights after this, to go home and  have some sleep.
    How pleasant the night air felt upon the outside of the mountain after  what he had gone through in the inside of it!  He hurried up the hill  without meeting a single goblin on the way, and called and tapped at  the window until he woke his father, who soon rose and let him in.
  He  told him the whole story; and, just as he had expected, his father  thought it best to work that lode no farther, but at the same time to  pretend occasionally to be at work there still in order that the  goblins might have no suspicions.
  Both father and son then went to bed  and slept soundly until the morning.
            The Princess's King-Papa    The weather continued fine for weeks, and the little princess went out  every day.
  So long a period of fine weather had indeed never been  known upon that mountain.
  The only uncomfortable thing was that her  nurse was so nervous and particular about being in before the sun was  down that often she would take to her heels when nothing worse than a  fleecy cloud crossing the sun threw a shadow on the hillside; and many  an evening they were home a full hour before the sunlight had left the  weather-cock on the stables.
  If it had not been for such odd behaviour  Irene would by this time have almost forgotten the goblins.
  She never  forgot Curdie, but him she remembered for his own sake, and indeed  would have remembered him if only because a princess never forgets her  debts until they are paid.
    One splendid sunshiny day, about an hour after noon, Irene, who was  playing on a lawn in the garden, heard the distant blast of a bugle.
  She jumped up with a cry of joy, for she knew by that particular blast  that her father was on his way to see her.
  This part of the garden lay  on the slope of the hill and allowed a full view of the country below.
  So she shaded her eyes with her hand and looked far away to catch the  first glimpse of shining armour.
 In a few moments a little troop came  glittering round the shoulder of a hill.
  Spears and helmets were  sparkling and gleaming, banners were flying, horses prancing, and again  came the bugle-blast which was to her like the voice of her father  calling across the distance: 'Irene, I'm coming.
'    On and on they came until she could clearly distinguish the king.
 He  rode a white horse and was taller than any of the men with him.
 He wore  a narrow circle of gold set with jewels around his helmet, and as he  came still nearer Irene could discern the flashing of the stones in the  sun.
  It was a long time since he had been to see her, and her little  heart beat faster and faster as the shining troop approached, for she  loved her king-papa very dearly and was nowhere so happy as in his  arms.
  When they reached a certain point, after which she could see  them no more from the garden, she ran to the gate, and there stood till  up they came, clanging and stamping, with one more bright bugle-blast  which said: 'Irene, I am come.
'    By this time the people of the house were all gathered at the gate, but  Irene stood alone in front of them.
  When the horsemen pulled up she  ran to the side of the white horse and held up her arms.
 The king  stopped and took her hands.
  In an instant she was on the saddle and  clasped in his great strong arms.
    I wish I could describe the king so that you could see him in your  mind.
  He had gentle, blue eyes, but a nose that made him look like an  eagle.
  A long dark beard, streaked with silvery lines, flowed from his  mouth almost to his waist, and as Irene sat on the saddle and hid her  glad face upon his bosom it mingled with the golden hair which her  mother had given her, and the two together were like a cloud with  streaks of the sun woven through it.
  After he had held her to his  heart for a minute he spoke to his white horse, and the great beautiful  creature, which had been prancing so proudly a little while before,  walked as gently as a lady--for he knew he had a little lady on his  back--through the gate and up to the door of the house.
  Then the king  set her on the ground and, dismounting, took her hand and walked with  her into the great hall, which was hardly ever entered except when he  came to see his little princess.
  There he sat down, with two of his  counsellors who had accompanied him, to have some refreshment, and  Irene sat on his right hand and drank her milk out of a wooden bowl  curiously carved.
    After the king had eaten and drunk he turned to the princess and said,  stroking her hair:    'Now, my child, what shall we do next?'    This was the question he almost always put to her first after their  meal together; and Irene had been waiting for it with some impatience,  for now, she thought, she should be able to settle a question which  constantly perplexed her.
    'I should like you to take me to see my great old grandmother.
'    The king looked grave And said:    'What does my little daughter mean?'    'I mean the Queen Irene that lives up in the tower--the very old lady,  you know, with the long hair of silver.
'    The king only gazed at his little princess with a look which she could  not understand.
    'She's got her crown in her bedroom,' she went on; 'but I've not been  in there yet.
  You know she's there, don't you?'    'No,' said the king, very quietly.
    'Then it must all be a dream,' said Irene.
  'I half thought it was; but  I couldn't be sure.
  Now I am sure of it.
  Besides, I couldn't find her  the next time I went up.
'    At that moment a snow-white pigeon flew in at an open window and  settled upon Irene's head.
  She broke into a merry laugh, cowered a  little, and put up her hands to her head, saying:    'Dear dovey, don't peck me.
  You'll pull out my hair with your long  claws if you don't mind.
'    The king stretched out his hand to take the pigeon, but it spread its  wings and flew again through the open window, when its Whiteness made  one flash in the sun and vanished.
  The king laid his hand on his  princess's head, held it back a little, gazed in her face, smiled half  a smile, and sighed half a sigh.
    'Come, my child; we'll have a walk in the garden together,' he said.
    'You won't come up and see my huge, great, beautiful grandmother, then,  king-papa?' said the princess.
    'Not this time,' said the king very gently.
  'She has not invited me,  you know, and great old ladies like her do not choose to be visited  without leave asked and given.
'    The garden was a very lovely place.
  Being upon a Mountainside there  were parts in it where the rocks came through in great masses, and all  immediately about them remained quite wild.
  Tufts of heather grew upon  them, and other hardy mountain plants and flowers, while near them  would be lovely roses and lilies and all pleasant garden flowers.
  This  mingling of the wild mountain with the civilized garden was very  quaint, and it was impossible for any number of gardeners to make such  a garden look formal and stiff.
    Against one of these rocks was a garden seat, shadowed from the  afternoon sun by the overhanging of the rock itself.
  There was a  little winding path up to the top of the rock, and on top another seat;  but they sat on the seat at its foot because the sun was hot; and there  they talked together of many things.
  At length the king said:    'You were out late one evening, Irene.
'    'Yes, papa.
  It was my fault; and Lootie was very sorry.
'    'I must talk to Lootie about it,' said the king.
    'Don't speak loud to her, please, papa,' said Irene.
  'She's been so  afraid of being late ever since!  Indeed she has not been naughty.
  It  was only a mistake for once.
'    'Once might be too often,' murmured the king to himself, as he stroked  his child's head.
    I can't tell you how he had come to know.
  I am sure Curdie had not  told him.
  Someone about the palace must have seen them, after all.
    He sat for a good while thinking.
  There was no sound to be heard  except that of a little stream which ran merrily out of an opening in  the rock by where they sat, and sped away down the hill through the  garden.
  Then he rose and, leaving Irene where she was, went into the  house and sent for Lootie, with whom he had a talk that made her cry.
    When in the evening he rode away upon his great white horse, he left  six of his attendants behind him, with orders that three of them should  watch outside the house every night, walking round and round it from  sunset to sunrise.
  It was clear he was not quite comfortable about the  princess.
            The Old Lady's Bedroom    Nothing more happened worth telling for some time.
  The autumn came and  went by.
  There were no more flowers in the garden.
  The wind blew  strong, and howled among the rocks.
  The rain fell, and drenched the  few yellow and red leaves that could not get off the bare branches.
  Again and again there would be a glorious morning followed by a pouring  afternoon, and sometimes, for a week together, there would be rain,  nothing but rain, all day, and then the most lovely cloudless night,  with the sky all out in full-blown stars--not one missing.
  But the  princess could not see much of them, for she went to bed early.
  The  winter drew on, and she found things growing dreary.
  When it was too  stormy to go out, and she had got tired of her toys, Lootie would take  her about the house, sometimes to the housekeeper's room, where the  housekeeper, who was a good, kind old woman, made much of  her--sometimes to the servants' hall or the kitchen, where she was not  princess merely, but absolute queen, and ran a great risk of being  spoiled.
 Sometimes she would run off herself to the room where the  men-at-arms whom the king had left sat, and they showed her their arms  and accoutrements and did what they could to amuse her.
  Still at times  she found it very dreary, and often and often wished that her huge  great grandmother had not been a dream.
    One morning the nurse left her with the housekeeper for a while.
 To  amuse her she turned out the contents of an old cabinet upon the table.
  The little princess found her treasures, queer ancient ornaments, and  many things the use of which she could not imagine, far more  interesting than her own toys, and sat playing with them for two hours  or more.
  But, at length, in handling a curious old-fashioned brooch,  she ran the pin of it into her thumb, and gave a little scream with the  sharpness of the pain, but would have thought little more of it had not  the pain increased and her thumb begun to swell.
  This alarmed the  housekeeper greatly.
  The nurse was fetched; the doctor was sent for;  her hand was poulticed, and long before her usual time she was put to  bed.
  The pain still continued, and although she fell asleep and  dreamed a good many dreams, there was the pain always in every dream.
  At last it woke her UP.
    The moon was shining brightly into the room.
  The poultice had fallen  off her hand and it was burning hot.
  She fancied if she could hold it  into the moonlight that would cool it.
  So she got out of bed, without  waking the nurse who lay at the other end of the room, and went to the  window.
  When she looked out she saw one of the men-at-arms walking in  the garden with the moonlight glancing on his armour.
  She was just  going to tap on the window and call him, for she wanted to tell him all  about it, when she bethought herself that that might wake Lootie, and  she would put her into her bed again.
  So she resolved to go to the  window of another room, and call him from there.
  It was so much nicer  to have somebody to talk to than to lie awake in bed with the burning  pain in her hand.
  She opened the door very gently and went through the  nursery, which did not look into the garden, to go to the other window.
  But when she came to the foot of the old staircase there was the moon  shining down from some window high up, and making the worm-eaten oak  look very strange and delicate and lovely.
  In a moment she was putting  her little feet one after the other in the silvery path up the stair,  looking behind as she went, to see the shadow they made in the middle  of the silver.
  Some little girls would have been afraid to find  themselves thus alone in the middle of the night, but Irene was a  princess.
    As she went slowly up the stair, not quite sure that she was not  dreaming, suddenly a great longing woke up in her heart to try once  more whether she could not find the old lady with the silvery hair.
 'If  she is a dream,' she said to herself, 'then I am the likelier to find  her, if I am dreaming.
'    So up and up she went, stair after stair, until she Came to the many  rooms--all just as she had seen them before.
  Through passage after  passage she softly sped, comforting herself that if she should lose her  way it would not matter much, because when she woke she would find  herself in her own bed with Lootie not far off.
 But, as if she had  known every step of the way, she walked straight to the door at the  foot of the narrow stair that led to the tower.
    'What if I should realreality-really find my beautiful old grandmother  up there!' she said to herself as she crept up the steep steps.
    When she reached the top she stood a moment listening in the dark, for  there was no moon there.
  Yes! it was! it was the hum of the  spinning-wheel!  What a diligent grandmother to work both day and  night!  She tapped gently at the door.
    'Come in, Irene,'said the sweet voice.
    The princess opened the door and entered.
  There was the moonlight  streaming in at the window, and in the middle of the moonlight sat the  old lady in her black dress with the white lace, and her silvery hair  mingling with the moonlight, so that you could not have told which was  which.
  'Come in, Irene,' she said again.
  'Can you tell me what I am  spinning?'    'She speaks,' thought Irene, 'just as if she had seen me five minutes  ago, or yesterday at the farthest.
 --No,' she answered; 'I don't know  what you are spinning.
  Please, I thought you were a dream.
  Why  couldn't I find you before, great-great-grandmother?'    'That you are hardly old enough to understand.
  But you would have  found me sooner if you hadn't come to think I was a dream.
  I will give  you one reason though why you couldn't find me.
  I didn't want you to  find me.
'    'Why, please?'    'Because I did not want Lootie to know I was here.
'    'But you told me to tell Lootie.
'    'Yes.
  But I knew Lootie would not believe you.
  If she were to see me  sitting spinning here, she wouldn't believe me, either.
'    'Why?'    'Because she couldn't.
  She would rub her eyes, and go away and say she  felt queer, and forget half of it and more, and then say it had been  all a dream.
'    'Just like me,' said Irene, feeling very much ashamed of herself.
    'Yes, a good deal like you, but not just like you; for you've come  again; and Lootie wouldn't have come again.
  She would have said, No,  no--she had had enough of such nonsense.
'    'Is it naughty of Lootie, then?'    'It would be naughty of you.
  I've never done anything for Lootie.
'    'And you did wash my face and hands for me,' said Irene, beginning to  cry.
    The old lady smiled a sweet smile and said:    'I'm not vexed with you, my child--nor with Lootie either.
  But I don't  want you to say anything more to Lootie about me.
  If she should ask  you, you must just be silent.
  But I do not think she will ask you.
'    All the time they talked the old lady kept on spinning.
    'You haven't told me yet what I am spinning,' she said.
    'Because I don't know.
  It's very pretty stuff.
'    It was indeed very pretty stuff.
  There was a good bunch of it on the  distaff attached to the spinning-wheel, and in the moonlight it shone  like--what shall I say it was like?  It was not white enough for  silver--yes, it was like silver, but shone grey rather than white, and  glittered only a little.
  And the thread the old lady drew out from it  was so fine that Irene could hardly see it.
 'I am spinning this for  you, my child.
'    'For me!  What am I to do with it, please?'    'I will tell you by and by.
  But first I will tell you what it is.
 It  is spider-web--of a particular kind.
  My pigeons bring it me from over  the great sea.
  There is only one forest where the spiders live who  make this particular kind--the finest and strongest of any.
  I have  nearly finished my present job.
  What is on the rock now will be  enough.
  I have a week's work there yet, though,' she added, looking at  the bunch.
    'Do you work all day and all night, too,  great-great-great-great-grandmother?' said the princess, thinking to be  very polite with so many greats.
    'I am not quite so great as all that,' she answered, smiling almost  merrily.
  'If you call me grandmother, that will do.
  No, I don't work  every night--only moonlit nights, and then no longer than the moon  shines upon my wheel.
  I shan't work much longer tonight.
'    'And what will you do next, grandmother?' 'Go to bed.
  Would you like  to see my bedroom?'    'Yes, that I should.
'    'Then I think I won't work any longer tonight.
  I shall be in good  time.
'    The old lady rose, and left her wheel standing just as it was.
  You see  there was no good in putting it away, for where there was not any  furniture there was no danger of being untidy.
    Then she took Irene by the hand, but it was her bad hand and Irene gave  a little cry of pain.
  'My child!' said her grandmother, 'what is the  matter?'    Irene held her hand into the moonlight, that the old lady might see it,  and told her all about it, at which she looked grave.
  But she only  said: 'Give me your other hand'; and, having led her out upon the  little dark landing, opened the door on the opposite side of it.
  What  was Irene's surprise to see the loveliest room she had ever seen in her  life!  It was large and lofty, and dome-shaped.
 From the centre hung a  lamp as round as a ball, shining as if with the brightest moonlight,  which made everything visible in the room, though not so clearly that  the princess could tell what many of the things were.
  A large oval bed  stood in the middle, with a coverlid of rose colour, and velvet  curtains all round it of a lovely pale blue.
  The walls were also  blue--spangled all over with what looked like stars of silver.
    The old lady left her and, going to a strange-looking cabinet, opened  it and took out a curious silver casket.
  Then she sat down on a low  chair and, calling Irene, made her kneel before her while she looked at  her hand.
  Having examined it, she opened the casket, and took from it  a little ointment.
  The sweetest odour filled the room--like that of  roses and lilies--as she rubbed the ointment gently all over the hot  swollen hand.
  Her touch was so pleasant and cool that it seemed to  drive away the pain and heat wherever it came.
    'Oh, grandmother! it is so nice!' said Irene.
  'Thank you; thank you.
'    Then the old lady went to a chest of drawers, and took out a large  handkerchief of gossamer-like cambric, which she tied round her hand.
    'I don't think I can let you go away tonight,' she said.
  'Would you  like to sleep with me?'    'Oh, yes, yes, dear grandmother,' said Irene, and would have clapped  her hands, forgetting that she could not.
    'You won't be afraid, then, to go to bed with such an old woman?'    'No.
  You are so beautiful, grandmother.
'    'But I am very old.
'    'And I suppose I am very young.
  You won't mind sleeping with such a  very young woman, grandmother?'    'You sweet little pertness!' said the old lady, and drew her towards  her, and kissed her on the forehead and the cheek and the mouth.
  Then  she got a large silver basin, and having poured some water into it made  Irene sit on the chair, and washed her feet.
 This done, she was ready  for bed.
  And oh, what a delicious bed it was into which her  grandmother laid her!  She hardly could have told she was lying upon  anything: she felt nothing but the softness.
    The old lady having undressed herself lay down beside her.
    'Why don't you put out your moon?' asked the princess.
    'That never goes out, night or day,' she answered.
  'In the darkest  night, if any of my pigeons are out on a message, they always see my  moon and know where to fly to.
'    'But if somebody besides the pigeons were to see it--somebody about the  house, I mean--they would come to look what it was and find you.
'    'The better for them, then,' said the old lady.
  'But it does not  happen above five times in a hundred years that anyone does see it.
    The greater part of those who do take it for a meteor, wink their eyes,  and forget it again.
  Besides, nobody could find the room except I  pleased.
  Besides, again--I will tell you a secret--if that light were  to go out you would fancy yourself lying in a bare garret, on a heap of  old straw, and would not see one of the pleasant things round about you  all the time.
'    'I hope it will never go out,' said the princess.
    'I hope not.
  But it is time we both went to sleep.
  Shall I take you  in my arms?'    The little princess nestled close up to the old lady, who took her in  both her arms and held her close to her bosom.
    'Oh, dear! this is so nice!' said the princess.
  'I didn't know  anything in the world could be so comfortable.
  I should like to lie  here for ever.
'    'You may if you will,' said the old lady.
  'But I must put you to one  trial-not a very hard one, I hope.
  This night week you must come back  to me.
  If you don't, I do not know when you may find me again, and you  will soon want me very much.
'    'Oh! please, don't let me forget.
'    'You shall not forget.
  The only question is whether you will believe I  am anywhere--whether you will believe I am anything but a dream.
  You  may be sure I will do all I can to help you to come.
 But it will rest  with yourself, after all.
  On the night of next Friday, you must come  to me.
  Mind now.
'    'I will try,' said the princess.
    'Then good night,' said the old lady, and kissed the forehead which lay  in her bosom.
    In a moment more the little princess was dreaming in the midst of the  loveliest dreams--of summer seas and moonlight and mossy springs and  great murmuring trees, and beds of wild flowers with such odours as she  had never smelled before.
  But, after all, no dream could be more  lovely than what she had left behind when she fell asleep.
    In the morning she found herself in her own bed.
  There was no  handkerchief or anything else on her hand, only a sweet odour lingered  about it.
  The swelling had all gone down; the prick of the brooch had  vanished--in fact, her hand was perfectly well.
            A Short Chapter About Curdie    Curdie spent many nights in the mine.
  His father and he had taken Mrs.  Peterson into the secret, for they knew mother could hold her tongue,  which was more than could be said of all the miners' wives.
    But Curdie did not tell her that every night he spent in the mine, part  of it went in earning a new red petticoat for her.
    Mrs. Peterson was such a nice good mother!  All mothers are nice and  good more or less, but Mrs. Peterson was nice and good all more and no  less.
  She made and kept a little heaven in that poor cottage on the  high hillside for her husband and son to go home to out of the low and  rather dreary earth in which they worked.
  I doubt if the princess was  very much happier even in the arms of her huge great-grandmother than  Peter and Curdie were in the arms of Mrs. Peterson.
  True, her hands  were hard and chapped and large, but it was with work for them; and  therefore, in the sight of the angels, her hands were so much the more  beautiful.
  And if Curdie worked hard to get her a petticoat, she  worked hard every day to get him comforts which he would have missed  much more than she would a new petticoat even in winter.
  Not that she  and Curdie ever thought of how much they worked for each other: that  would have spoiled everything.
    When left alone in the mine Curdie always worked on for an hour or two  at first, following the lode which, according to Glump, would lead at  last into the deserted habitation.
  After that, he would set out on a  reconnoitring expedition.
  In order to manage this, or rather the  return from it, better than the first time, he had bought a huge ball  of fine string, having learned the trick from Hop-o'-my-Thumb, whose  history his mother had often told him.
  Not that Hop-o'-my-Thumb had  ever used a ball of string--I should be sorry to be supposed so far out  in my classics--but the principle was the same as that of the pebbles.
  The end of this string he fastened to his pickaxe, which figured no bad  anchor, and then, with the ball in his hand, unrolling it as he went,  set out in the dark through the natural gangs of the goblins'  territory.
  The first night or two he came upon nothing worth  remembering; saw only a little of the home-life of the cobs in the  various caves they called houses; failed in coming upon anything to  cast light upon the foregoing design which kept the inundation for the  present in the background.
  But at length, I think on the third or  fourth night, he found, partly guided by the noise of their implements,  a company of evidently the best sappers and miners amongst them, hard  at work.
  What were they about?  It could not well be the inundation,  seeing that had in the meantime been postponed to something else.
  Then  what was it?  He lurked and watched, every now and then in the greatest  risk of being detected, but without success.
  He had again and again to  retreat in haste, a proceeding rendered the more difficult that he had  to gather up his string as he returned upon its course.
  It was not  that he was afraid of the goblins, but that he was afraid of their  finding out that they were watched, which might have prevented the  discovery at which he aimed.
  Sometimes his haste had to be such that,  when he reached home towards morning, his string, for lack of time to  wind it up as he 'dodged the cobs', would be in what seemed most  hopeless entanglement; but after a good sleep, though a short one, he  always found his mother had got it right again.
  There it was, wound in  a most respectable ball, ready for use the moment he should want it!    'I can't think how you do it, mother,' he would say.
    'I follow the thread,' she would answer--'just as you do in the mine.
'  She never had more to say about it; but the less clever she was with  her words, the more clever she was with her hands; and the less his  mother said, the more Curdie believed she had to say.
  But still he had  made no discovery as to what the goblin miners were about.
            The Cobs' Creatures    About this time the gentlemen whom the king had left behind him to  watch over the princess had each occasion to doubt the testimony of his  own eyes, for more than strange were the objects to which they would  bear witness.
  They were of one sort--creatures--but so grotesque and  misshapen as to be more like a child's drawings upon his slate than  anything natural.
  They saw them only at night, while on guard about  the house.
  The testimony of the man who first reported having seen one  of them was that, as he was walking slowly round the house, while yet  in the shadow, he caught sight of a creature standing on its hind legs  in the moonlight, with its forefeet upon a window-ledge, staring in at  the window.
  Its body might have been that of a dog or wolf, he  thought, but he declared on his honour that its head was twice the size  it ought to have been for the size of its body, and as round as a ball,  while the face, which it turned upon him as it fled, was more like one  carved by a boy upon the turnip inside which he is going to put a  candle than anything else he could think of.
  It rushed into the  garden.
 He sent an arrow after it, and thought he must have struck it;  for it gave an unearthly howl, and he could not find his arrow any more  than the beast, although he searched all about the place where it  vanished.
  They laughed at him until he was driven to hold his tongue,  and said he must have taken too long a pull at the ale-jug.
    But before two nights were over he had one to side with him, for he,  too, had seen something strange, only quite different from that  reported by the other.
  The description the second man gave of the  creature he had seen was yet more grotesque and unlikely.
  They were  both laughed at by the rest; but night after night another came over to  their side, until at last there was only one left to laugh at all his  companions.
  Two nights more passed, and he saw nothing; but on the  third he came rushing from the garden to the other two before the  house, in such an agitation that they declared--for it was their turn  now--that the band of his helmet was cracking under his chin with the  rising of his hair inside it.
 Running with him into that part of the  garden which I have already described, they saw a score of creatures,  to not one of which they could give a name, and not one of which was  like another, hideous and ludicrous at once, gambolling on the lawn in  the moonlight.
 The supernatural or rather subnatural ugliness of their  faces, the length of legs and necks in some, the apparent absence of  both or either in others, made the spectators, although in one consent  as to what they saw, yet doubtful, as I have said, of the evidence of  their own eyes--and ears as well; for the noises they made, although  not loud, were as uncouth and varied as their forms, and could be  described neither as grunts nor squeaks nor roars nor howls nor barks  nor yells nor screams nor croaks nor hisses nor mews nor shrieks, but  only as something like all of them mingled in one horrible dissonance.
  Keeping in the shade, the watchers had a few moments to recover  themselves before the hideous assembly suspected their presence; but  all at once, as if by common consent, they scampered off in the  direction of a great rock, and vanished before the men had come to  themselves sufficiently to think of following them.
    My readers will suspect what these were; but I will now give them full  information concerning them.
  They were, of course, household animals  belonging to the goblins, whose ancestors had taken their ancestors  many centuries before from the upper regions of light into the lower  regions of darkness.
  The original stocks of these horrible creatures  were very much the same as the animals now seen about farms and homes  in the country, with the exception of a few of them, which had been  wild creatures, such as foxes, and indeed wolves and small bears, which  the goblins, from their proclivity towards the animal creation, had  caught when cubs and tamed.
  But in the course of time all had  undergone even greater changes than had passed upon their owners.
  They  had altered--that is, their descendants had altered--into such  creatures as I have not attempted to describe except in the vaguest  manner--the various parts of their bodies assuming, in an apparently  arbitrary and self-willed manner, the most abnormal developments.
  Indeed, so little did any distinct type predominate in some of the  bewildering results, that you could only have guessed at any known  animal as the original, and even then, what likeness remained would be  more one of general expression than of definable conformation.
  But  what increased the gruesomeness tenfold was that, from constant  domestic, or indeed rather family association with the goblins, their  countenances had grown in grotesque resemblance to the human.
    No one understands animals who does not see that every one of them,  even amongst the fishes, it may be with a dimness and vagueness  infinitely remote, yet shadows the human: in the case of these the  human resemblance had greatly increased: while their owners had sunk  towards them, they had risen towards their owners.
  But the conditions  of subterranean life being equally unnatural for both, while the  goblins were worse, the creatures had not improved by the  approximation, and its result would have appeared far more ludicrous  than consoling to the warmest lover of animal nature.
  I shall now  explain how it was that just then these animals began to show  themselves about the king's country house.
    The goblins, as Curdie had discovered, were mining on--at work both day  and night, in divisions, urging the scheme after which he lay in wait.
  In the course of their tunnelling they had broken into the channel of a  small stream, but the break being in the top of it, no water had  escaped to interfere with their work.
  Some of the creatures, hovering  as they often did about their masters, had found the hole, and had,  with the curiosity which had grown to a passion from the restraints of  their unnatural circumstances, proceeded to explore the channel.
  The  stream was the same which ran out by the seat on which Irene and her  king-papa had sat as I have told, and the goblin creatures found it  jolly fun to get out for a romp on a smooth lawn such as they had never  seen in all their poor miserable lives.
  But although they had partaken  enough of the nature of their owners to delight in annoying and  alarming any of the people whom they met on the mountain, they were, of  course, incapable of designs of their own, or of intentionally  furthering those of their masters.
    For several nights after the men-at-arms were at length of one mind as  to the fact of the visits of some horrible creatures, whether bodily or  spectral they could not yet say, they watched with special attention  that part of the garden where they had last seen them.
  Perhaps indeed  they gave in consequence too little attention to the house.
  But the  creatures were too cunning to be easily caught; nor were the watchers  quick-eyed enough to descry the head, or the keen eyes in it, which,  from the opening whence the stream issued, would watch them in turn,  ready, the moment they should leave the lawn, to report the place clear.
            That Night Week    During the whole of the week Irene had been thinking every other moment  of her promise to the old lady, although even now she could not feel  quite sure that she had not been dreaming.
  Could it really be that an  old lady lived up in the top of the house, with pigeons and a  spinning-wheel, and a lamp that never went out?  She was, however, none  the less determined, on the coming Friday, to ascend the three stairs,  walk through the passages with the many doors, and try to find the  tower in which she had either seen or dreamed her grandmother.
    Her nurse could not help wondering what had come to the child--she  would sit so thoughtfully silent, and even in the midst of a game with  her would so suddenly fall into a dreamy mood.
  But Irene took care to  betray nothing, whatever efforts Lootie might make to get at her  thoughts.
  And Lootie had to say to herself: 'What an odd child she  is!' and give it up.
    At length the longed-for Friday arrived, and lest Lootie should be  moved to watch her, Irene endeavoured to keep herself as quiet as  possible.
  In the afternoon she asked for her doll's house, and went on  arranging and rearranging the various rooms and their inhabitants for a  whole hour.
  Then she gave a sigh and threw herself back in her chair.
  One of the dolls would not sit, and another would not stand, and they  were all very tiresome.
  Indeed, there was one would not even lie down,  which was too bad.
  But it was now getting dark, and the darker it got  the more excited Irene became, and the more she felt it necessary to be  composed.
    'I see you want your tea, princess,' said the nurse: 'I will go and get  it.
  The room feels close: I will open the window a little.
 The evening  is mild: it won't hurt you.
'    'There's no fear of that, Lootie,' said Irene, wishing she had put off  going for the tea till it was darker, when she might have made her  attempt with every advantage.
    I fancy Lootie was longer in returning than she had intended; for when  Irene, who had been lost in thought, looked up, she saw it was nearly  dark, and at the same moment caught sight of a pair of eyes, bright  with a green light, glowering at her through the open window.
  The next  instant something leaped into the room.
  It was like a cat, with legs  as long as a horse's, Irene said, but its body no bigger and its legs  no thicker than those of a cat.
  She was too frightened to cry out, but  not too frightened to jump from her chair and run from the room.
    It is plain enough to every one of my readers what she ought to have  done--and indeed, Irene thought of it herself; but when she came to the  foot of the old stair, just outside the nursery door, she imagined the  creature running up those long ascents after her, and pursuing her  through the dark passages--which, after all, might lead to no tower!  That thought was too much.
  Her heart failed her, and, turning from the  stair, she rushed along to the hall, whence, finding the front door  open, she darted into the court pursued--at least she thought so--by  the creature.
  No one happening to see her, on she ran, unable to think  for fear, and ready to run anywhere to elude the awful creature with  the stilt-legs.
  Not daring to look behind her, she rushed straight out  of the gate and up the mountain.
  It was foolish indeed--thus to run  farther and farther from all who could help her, as if she had been  seeking a fit spot for the goblin creature to eat her in his leisure;  but that is the way fear serves us: it always sides with the thing we  are afraid of.
    The princess was soon out of breath with running uphill; but she ran  on, for she fancied the horrible creature just behind her, forgetting  that, had it been after her such long legs as those must have overtaken  her long ago.
  At last she could run no longer, and fell, unable even  to scream, by the roadside, where she lay for some time half dead with  terror.
  But finding nothing lay hold of her, and her breath beginning  to come back, she ventured at length to get half up and peer anxiously  about her.
  It was now so dark she could see nothing.
  Not a single  star was out.
  She could not even tell in what direction the house lay,  and between her and home she fancied the dreadful creature lying ready  to pounce upon her.
 She saw now that she ought to have run up the  stairs at once.
  It was well she did not scream; for, although very few  of the goblins had come out for weeks, a stray idler or two might have  heard her.
 She sat down upon a stone, and nobody but one who had done  something wrong could have been more miserable.
  She had quite  forgotten her promise to visit her grandmother.
  A raindrop fell on her  face.
  She looked up, and for a moment her terror was lost in  astonishment.
  At first she thought the rising moon had left her place,  and drawn nigh to see what could be the matter with the little girl,  sitting alone, without hat or cloak, on the dark bare mountain; but she  soon saw she was mistaken, for there was no light on the ground at her  feet, and no shadow anywhere.
  But a great silver globe was hanging in  the air; and as she gazed at the lovely thing, her courage revived.
  If  she were but indoors again, she would fear nothing, not even the  terrible creature with the long legs!  But how was she to find her way  back?  What could that light be?  Could it be--? No, it couldn't.
  But  what if it should be--yes--it must be--her great-great-grandmother's  lamp, which guided her pigeons home through the darkest night!  She  jumped up: she had but to keep that light in view and she must find the  house.
  Her heart grew strong.
  Speedily, yet softly, she walked down  the hill, hoping to pass the watching creature unseen.
  Dark as it was,  there was little danger now of choosing the wrong road.
  And--which was  most strange--the light that filled her eyes from the lamp, instead of  blinding them for a moment to the object upon which they next fell,  enabled her for a moment to see it, despite the darkness.
  By looking  at the lamp and then dropping her eyes, she could see the road for a  yard or two in front of her, and this saved her from several falls, for  the road was very rough.
  But all at once, to her dismay, it vanished,  and the terror of the beast, which had left her the moment she began to  return, again laid hold of her heart.
  The same instant, however, she  caught the light of the windows, and knew exactly where she was.
  It  was too dark to run, but she made what haste she could, and reached the  gate in safety.
  She found the house door still open, ran through the  hall, and, without even looking into the nursery, bounded straight up  the stair, and the next, and the next; then turning to the right, ran  through the long avenue of silent rooms, and found her way at once to  the door at the foot of the tower stair.
    When first the nurse missed her, she fancied she was playing her a  trick, and for some time took no trouble about her; but at last,  getting frightened, she had begun to search; and when the princess  entered, the whole household was hither and thither over the house,  hunting for her.
  A few seconds after she reached the stair of the  tower they had even begun to search the neglected rooms, in which they  would never have thought of looking had they not already searched every  other place they could think of in vain.
  But by this time she was  knocking at the old lady's door.
            Woven and Then Spun    'Come in, Irene,' said the silvery voice of her grandmother.
    The princess opened the door and peeped in.
  But the room was quite  dark and there was no sound of the spinning-wheel.
  She grew frightened  once more, thinking that, although the room was there, the old lady  might be a dream after all.
  Every little girl knows how dreadful it is  to find a room empty where she thought somebody was; but Irene had to  fancy for a moment that the person she came to find was nowhere at all.
  She remembered, however, that at night she spun only in the moonlight,  and concluded that must be why there was no sweet, bee-like humming:  the old lady might be somewhere in the darkness.
  Before she had time  to think another thought, she heard her voice again, saying as before:  'Come in, Irene.
'  From the sound, she understood at once that she was  not in the room beside her.
  Perhaps she was in her bedroom.
  She  turned across the passage, feeling her way to the other door.
  When her  hand fell on the lock, again the old lady spoke:    'Shut the other door behind you, Irene.
  I always close the door of my  workroom when I go to my chamber.
'    Irene wondered to hear her voice so plainly through the door: having  shut the other, she opened it and went in.
  Oh, what a lovely haven to  reach from the darkness and fear through which she had come!  The soft  light made her feel as if she were going into the heart of the milkiest  pearl; while the blue walls and their silver stars for a moment  perplexed her with the fancy that they were in reality the sky which  she had left outside a minute ago covered with rainclouds.
    'I've lighted a fire for you, Irene: you're cold and wet,' said her  grandmother.
    Then Irene looked again, and saw that what she had taken for a huge  bouquet of red roses on a low stand against the wall was in fact a fire  which burned in the shapes of the loveliest and reddest roses, glowing  gorgeously between the heads and wings of two cherubs of shining  silver.
  And when she came nearer, she found that the smell of roses  with which the room was filled came from the fire-roses on the hearth.
  Her grandmother was dressed in the loveliest pale blue velvet, over  which her hair, no longer white, but of a rich golden colour, streamed  like a cataract, here falling in dull gathered heaps, there rushing  away in smooth shining falls.
  And ever as she looked, the hair seemed  pouring down from her head and vanishing in a golden mist ere it  reached the floor.
  It flowed from under the edge of a circle of  shining silver, set with alternated pearls and opals.
  On her dress was  no ornament whatever, neither was there a ring on her hand, or a  necklace or carcanet about her neck.
  But her slippers glimmered with  the light of the Milky Way, for they were covered with seed-pearls and  opals in one mass.
  Her face was that of a woman of three-and-twenty.
    The princess was so bewildered with astonishment and admiration that  she could hardly thank her, and drew nigh with timidity, feeling dirty  and uncomfortable.
  The lady was seated on a low chair by the side of  the fire, with hands outstretched to take her, but the princess hung  back with a troubled smile.
    'Why, what's the matter?' asked her grandmother.
  'You haven't been  doing anything wrong--I know that by your face, though it is rather  miserable.
  What's the matter, my dear?'    And she still held out her arms.
    'Dear grandmother,' said Irene, 'I'm not so sure that I haven't done  something wrong.
  I ought to have run up to you at once when the  long-legged cat came in at the window, instead of running out on the  mountain and making myself such a fright.
'    'You were taken by surprise, my child, and you are not so likely to do  it again.
  It is when people do wrong things wilfully that they are the  more likely to do them again.
  Come.
'    And still she held out her arms.
    'But, grandmother, you're so beautiful and grand with your crown on;  and I am so dirty with mud and rain!  I should quite spoil your  beautiful blue dress.
'    With a merry little laugh the lady sprung from her chair, more lightly  far than Irene herself could, caught the child to her bosom, and,  kissing the tear-stained face over and over, sat down with her in her  lap.
    'Oh, grandmother!  You'll make yourself such a mess!' cried Irene,  clinging to her.
    'You darling! do you think I care more for my dress than for my little  girl?  Besides--look here.
'    As she spoke she set her down, and Irene saw to her dismay that the  lovely dress was covered with the mud of her fall on the mountain road.
  But the lady stooped to the fire, and taking from it, by the stalk in  her fingers, one of the burning roses, passed it once and again and a  third time over the front of her dress; and when Irene looked, not a  single stain was to be discovered.
    'There!' said her grandmother, 'you won't mind coming to me now?'    But Irene again hung back, eying the flaming rose which the lady held  in her hand.
    'You're not afraid of the rose--are you?' she said, about to throw it  on the hearth again.
    'Oh! don't, please!' cried Irene.
  'Won't you hold it to my frock and  my hands and my face?  And I'm afraid my feet and my knees want it too.
'    'No, answered her grandmother, smiling a little sadly, as she threw the  rose from her; 'it is too hot for you yet.
  It would set your frock in  a flame.
  Besides, I don't want to make you clean tonight.
    I want your nurse and the rest of the people to see you as you are, for  you will have to tell them how you ran away for fear of the long-legged  cat.
  I should like to wash you, but they would not believe you then.
  Do you see that bath behind you?'    The princess looked, and saw a large oval tub of silver, shining  brilliantly in the light of the wonderful lamp.
    'Go and look into it,' said the lady.
    Irene went, and came back very silent with her eyes shining.
    'What did you see?' asked her grandmother.
    'The sky, and the moon and the stars,' she answered.
  'It looked as if  there was no bottom to it.
'    The lady smiled a pleased satisfied smile, and was silent also for a  few moments.
  Then she said:    'Any time you want a bath, come to me.
  I know YOU have a bath every  morning, but sometimes you want one at night, too.
'    'Thank you, grandmother; I will--I will indeed,' answered Irene, and  was again silent for some moments thinking.
  Then she said: 'How was  it, grandmother, that I saw your beautiful lamp--not the light of it  only--but the great round silvery lamp itself, hanging alone in the  great open air, high up?  It was your lamp I saw--wasn't it?'    'Yes, my child--it was my lamp.
'    'Then how was it?  I don't see a window all round.
'    'When I please I can make the lamp shine through the walls--shine so  strong that it melts them away from before the sight, and shows itself  as you saw it.
  But, as I told you, it is not everybody can see it.
'    'How is it that I can, then?  I'm sure I don't know.
'    'It is a gift born with you.
  And one day I hope everybody will have  it.
'    'But how do you make it shine through the walls?'    'Ah! that you would not understand if I were to try ever so much to  make you--not yet--not yet.
  But,' added the lady, rising, 'you must  sit in my chair while I get you the present I have been preparing for  you.
  I told you my spinning was for you.
  It is finished now, and I am  going to fetch it.
  I have been keeping it warm under one of my  brooding pigeons.
'    Irene sat down in the low chair, and her grandmother left her, shutting  the door behind her.
  The child sat gazing, now at the rose fire, now  at the starry walls, now at the silver light; and a great quietness  grew in her heart.
  If all the long-legged cats in the world had come  rushing at her then she would not have been afraid of them for a  moment.
  How this was she could not tell--she only knew there was no  fear in her, and everything was so right and safe that it could not get  in.
    She had been gazing at the lovely lamp for some minutes fixedly:  turning her eyes, she found the wall had vanished, for she was looking  out on the dark cloudy night.
  But though she heard the wind blowing,  none of it blew upon her.
  In a moment more the clouds themselves  parted, or rather vanished like the wall, and she looked straight into  the starry herds, flashing gloriously in the dark blue.
  It was but for  a moment.
  The clouds gathered again and shut out the stars; the wall  gathered again and shut out the clouds; and there stood the lady beside  her with the loveliest smile on her face, and a shimmering ball in her  hand, about the size of a pigeon's egg.
    'There, Irene; there is my work for you!' she said, holding out the  ball to the princess.
    She took it in her hand, and looked at it all over.
  It sparkled a  little, and shone here and there, but not much.
  It was of a sort of  grey-whiteness, something like spun glass.
    'Is this all your spinning, grandmother?' she asked.
    'All since you came to the house.
  There is more there than you think.
'    'How pretty it is!  What am I to do with it, please?'    'That I will now explain to you,' answered the lady, turning from her  and going to her cabinet.
  She came back with a small ring in her hand.
  Then she took the ball from Irene's, and did something with the  ring--Irene could not tell what.
    'Give me your hand,' she said.
  Irene held up her right hand.
    'Yes, that is the hand I want,' said the lady, and put the ring on the  forefinger of it.
    'What a beautiful ring!' said Irene.
  'What is the stone called?'    'It is a fire-opal.
' 'Please, am I to keep it?'    'Always.
' 'Oh, thank you, grandmother!  It's prettier than anything I  ever saw, except those--of all colours-in your--Please, is that your  crown?'    'Yes, it is my crown.
  The stone in your ring is of the same sort--only  not so good.
  It has only red, but mine have all colours, you see.
'    'Yes, grandmother.
  I will take such care of it!  But--' she added,  hesitating.
    'But what?' asked her grandmother.
    'What am I to say when Lootie asks me where I got it?'    'You will ask her where you got it,' answered the lady smiling.
    'I don't see how I can do that.
'    'You will, though.
'    'Of course I will, if you say so.
  But, you know, I can't pretend not  to know.
'    'Of course not.
  But don't trouble yourself about it.
  You will see  when the time comes.
'    So saying, the lady turned, and threw the little ball into the rose  fire.
    'Oh, grandmother!' exclaimed Irene; 'I thought you had spun it for me.
'    'So I did, my child.
  And you've got it.
'    'No; it's burnt in the fire!'    The lady put her hand in the fire, brought out the ball, glimmering as  before, and held it towards her.
  Irene stretched out her hand to take  it, but the lady turned and, going to her cabinet, opened a drawer, and  laid the ball in it.
    'Have I done anything to vex you, grandmother?' said Irene pitifully.
    'No, my darling.
  But you must understand that no one ever gives  anything to another properly and really without keeping it.
  That ball  is yours.
'    'Oh! I'm not to take it with me!  You are going to keep it for me!'    'You are to take it with you.
  I've fastened the end of it to the ring  on your finger.
'    Irene looked at the ring.
    'I can't see it there, grandmother,' she said.
    'Feel--a little way from the ring--towards the cabinet,' said the lady.
    'Oh! I do feel it!' exclaimed the princess.
  'But I can't see it,' she  added, looking close to her outstretched hand.
    'No.
  The thread is too fine for you to see it.
  You can only feel it.
  Now you can fancy how much spinning that took, although it does seem  such a little ball.
'    'But what use can I make of it, if it lies in your cabinet?'    'That is what I will explain to you.
  It would be of no use to you--it  wouldn't be yours at all if it did not lie in my cabinet.
  Now listen.
  If ever you find yourself in any danger--such, for example, as you were  in this same evening--you must take off your ring and put it under the  pillow of your bed.
  Then you must lay your finger, the same that wore  the ring, upon the thread, and follow the thread wherever it leads you.
'    'Oh, how delightful!  It will lead me to you, grandmother, I know!'    'Yes.
  But, remember, it may seem to you a very roundabout way indeed,  and you must not doubt the thread.
  Of one thing you may be sure, that  while you hold it, I hold it too.
'    'It is very wonderful!' said Irene thoughtfully.
  Then suddenly  becoming aware, she jumped up, crying:    'Oh, grandmother! here have I been sitting all this time in your chair,  and you standing!  I beg your pardon.
'    The lady laid her hand on her shoulder, and said:    'Sit down again, Irene.
  Nothing pleases me better than to see anyone  sit in my chair.
  I am only too glad to stand so long as anyone will  sit in it.
'    'How kind of you!' said the princess, and sat down again.
    'It makes me happy,' said the lady.
    'But,' said Irene, still puzzled, 'won't the thread get in somebody's  way and be broken, if the one end is fast to my ring, and the other  laid in your cabinet?'    'You will find all that arrange itself.
  I am afraid it is time for you  to go.
'    'Mightn't I stay and sleep with you tonight, grandmother?' 'No, not  tonight.
  If I had meant you to stay tonight, I should have given you a  bath; but you know everybody in the house is miserable about you, and  it would be cruel to keep them so all night.
  You must go downstairs.
'    'I'm so glad, grandmother, you didn't say "Go home," for this is my  home.
  Mayn't I call this my home?'    'You may, my child.
  And I trust you will always think it your home.
  Now come.
  I must take you back without anyone seeing you.
'    'Please, I want to ask you one question more,' said Irene.
  'Is it  because you have your crown on that you look so young?'    'No, child,' answered her grandmother; 'it is because I felt so young  this evening that I put my crown on.
  And I thought you would like to  see your old grandmother in her best.
'    'Why do you call yourself old?  You're not old, grandmother.
'    'I am very old indeed.
  It is so silly of people--I don't mean you, for  you are such a tiny, and couldn't know better--but it is so silly of  people to fancy that old age means crookedness and witheredness and  feebleness and sticks and spectacles and rheumatism and forgetfulness!  It is so silly! Old age has nothing whatever to do with all that.
  The  right old age means strength and beauty and mirth and courage and clear  eyes and strong painless limbs.
  I am older than you are able to think,  and--'    'And look at you, grandmother!' cried Irene, jumping up and flinging  her arms about her neck.
  'I won't be so silly again, I promise you.
  At least--I'm rather afraid to promise--but if I am, I promise to be  sorry for it--I do.
  I wish I were as old as you, grandmother.
  I don't  think you are ever afraid of anything.
'    'Not for long, at least, my child.
  Perhaps by the time I am two  thousand years of age, I shall, indeed, never be afraid of anything.
  But I confess I have sometimes been afraid about my children--sometimes  about you, Irene.
'    'Oh, I'm so sorry, grandmother!  Tonight, I suppose, you mean.
'    'Yes--a little tonight; but a good deal when you had all but made up  your mind that I was a dream, and no real great-great-grandmother.
  You  must not suppose I am blaming you for that.
  I dare say you could not  help it.
'    'I don't know, grandmother,' said the princess, beginning to cry.
 'I  can't always do myself as I should like.
  And I don't always try.
  I'm  very sorry anyhow.
'    The lady stooped, lifted her in her arms, and sat down with her in her  chair, holding her close to her bosom.
  In a few minutes the princess  had sobbed herself to sleep.
  How long she slept I do not know.
  When  she came to herself she was sitting in her own high chair at the  nursery table, with her doll's house before her.
            The Ring    The same moment her nurse came into the room, sobbing.
  When she saw  her sitting there she started back with a loud cry of amazement and  joy.
  Then running to her, she caught her in her arms and covered her  with kisses.
    'My precious darling princess! where have you been?  What has happened  to you?  We've all been crying our eyes out, and searching the house  from top to bottom for you.
'    'Not quite from the top,' thought Irene to herself; and she might have  added, 'not quite to the bottom', perhaps, if she had known all.
  But  the one she would not, and the other she could not say.
 'Oh, Lootie!  I've had such a dreadful adventure!' she replied, and told her all  about the cat with the long legs, and how she ran out upon the  mountain, and came back again.
  But she said nothing of her grandmother  or her lamp.
    'And there we've been searching for you all over the house for more  than an hour and a half!' exclaimed the nurse.
  'But that's no matter,  now we've got you!  Only, princess, I must say,' she added, her mood  changing, 'what you ought to have done was to call for your own Lootie  to come and help you, instead of running out of the house, and up the  mountain, in that wild, I must say, foolish fashion.
'    'Well, Lootie,' said Irene quietly, 'perhaps if you had a big cat, all  legs, running at you, you might not exactly know what was the wisest  thing to do at the moment.
'    'I wouldn't run up the mountain, anyhow,' returned Lootie.
    'Not if you had time to think about it.
  But when those creatures came  at you that night on the mountain, you were so frightened yourself that  you lost your way home.
'    This put a stop to Lootie's reproaches.
  She had been on the point of  saying that the long-legged cat must have been a twilight fancy of the  princess's, but the memory of the horrors of that night, and of the  talking-to which the king had given her in consequence, prevented her  from saying what after all she did not half believe--having a strong  suspicion that the cat was a goblin; for she knew nothing of the  difference between the goblins and their creatures: she counted them  all just goblins.
    Without another word she went and got some fresh tea and bread and  butter for the princess.
  Before she returned, the whole household,  headed by the housekeeper, burst into the nursery to exult over their  darling.
  The gentlemen-at-arms followed, and were ready enough to  believe all she told them about the long-legged cat.
 Indeed, though  wise enough to say nothing about it, they remembered, with no little  horror, just such a creature amongst those they had surprised at their  gambols upon the princess's lawn.
    In their own hearts they blamed themselves for not having kept better  watch.
  And their captain gave orders that from this night the front  door and all the windows on the ground floor should be locked  immediately the sun set, and opened after upon no pretence whatever.
  The men-at-arms redoubled their vigilance, and for some time there was  no further cause of alarm.
    When the princess woke the next morning, her nurse was bending over  her.
  'How your ring does glow this morning, princess!--just like a  fiery rose!' she said.
    'Does it, Lootie?' returned Irene.
  'Who gave me the ring, Lootie? I  know I've had it a long time, but where did I get it?  I don't  remember.
'    'I think it must have been your mother gave it you, princess; but  really, for as long as you have worn it, I don't remember that ever I  heard,' answered her nurse.
    'I will ask my king-papa the next time he comes,' said Irene.
            Springtime    The spring so dear to all creatures, young and old, came at last, and  before the first few days of it had gone, the king rode through its  budding valleys to see his little daughter.
  He had been in a distant  part of his dominions all the winter, for he was not in the habit of  stopping in one great city, or of visiting only his favourite country  houses, but he moved from place to place, that all his people might  know him.
  Wherever he journeyed, he kept a constant look-out for the  ablest and best men to put into office; and wherever he found himself  mistaken, and those he had appointed incapable or unjust, he removed  them at once.
  Hence you see it was his care of the people that kept  him from seeing his princess so often as he would have liked.
  You may  wonder why he did not take her about with him; but there were several  reasons against his doing so, and I suspect her great-great-grandmother  had had a principal hand in preventing it.
  Once more Irene heard the  bugle-blast, and once more she was at the gate to meet her father as he  rode up on his great white horse.
    After they had been alone for a little while, she thought of what she  had resolved to ask him.
    'Please, king-papa,' she said, 'Will you tell me where I got this  pretty ring?  I can't remember.
'    The king looked at it.
  A strange beautiful smile spread like sunshine  over his face, and an answering smile, but at the same time a  questioning one, spread like moonlight over Irene's.
  'It was your  queen-mamma's once,' he said.
    'And why isn't it hers now?' asked Irene.
    'She does not want it now,' said the king, looking grave.
    'Why doesn't she want it now?'    'Because she's gone where all those rings are made.
'    'And when shall I see her?' asked the princess.
    'Not for some time yet,' answered the king, and the tears came into his  eyes.
    Irene did not remember her mother and did not know why her father  looked so, and why the tears came in his eyes; but she put her arms  round his neck and kissed him, and asked no more questions.
    The king was much disturbed on hearing the report of the  gentlemen-at-arms concerning the creatures they had seen; and I presume  would have taken Irene with him that very day, but for what the  presence of the ring on her finger assured him of.
  About an hour  before he left, Irene saw him go up the old stair; and he did not come  down again till they were just ready to start; and she thought with  herself that he had been up to see the old lady.
  When he went away he  left other six gentlemen behind him, that there might be six of them  always on guard.
    And now, in the lovely spring weather, Irene was out on the mountain  the greater part of the day.
  In the warmer hollows there were lovely  primroses, and not so many that she ever got tired of them.
  As often  as she saw a new one opening an eye of light in the blind earth, she  would clap her hands with gladness, and unlike some children I know,  instead of pulling it, would touch it as tenderly as if it had been a  new baby, and, having made its acquaintance, would leave it as happy as  she found it.
  She treated the plants on which they grew like birds'  nests; every fresh flower was like a new little bird to her.
  She would  pay visits to all the flower-nests she knew, remembering each by  itself.
  She would go down on her hands and knees beside one and say:  'Good morning!  Are you all smelling very sweet this morning?  Good-bye!' and then she would go to another nest, and say the same.
  It  was a favourite amusement with her.
  There were many flowers up and  down, and she loved them all, but the primroses were her favourites.
    'They're not too shy, and they're not a bit forward,' she would say to  Lootie.
    There were goats too about, over the mountain, and when the little kids  came she was as pleased with them as with the flowers.
  The goats  belonged to the miners mostly-a few of them to Curdie's mother; but  there were a good many wild ones that seemed to belong to nobody.
  These the goblins counted theirs, and it was upon them partly that they  lived.
  They set snares and dug pits for them; and did not scruple to  take what tame ones happened to be caught; but they did not try to  steal them in any other manner, because they were afraid of the dogs  the hill-people kept to watch them, for the knowing dogs always tried  to bite their feet.
  But the goblins had a kind of sheep of their  own--very queer creatures, which they drove out to feed at night, and  the other goblin creatures were wise enough to keep good watch over  them, for they knew they should have their bones by and by.
            Curdie's Clue    Curdie was as watchful as ever, but was almost getting tired of his ill  success.
  Every other night or so he followed the goblins about, as  they went on digging and boring, and getting as near them as he could,  watched them from behind stones and rocks; but as yet he seemed no  nearer finding out what they had in view.
  As at first, he always kept  hold of the end of his string, while his pickaxe, left just outside the  hole by which he entered the goblins' country from the mine, continued  to serve as an anchor and hold fast the other end.
  The goblins,  hearing no more noise in that quarter, had ceased to apprehend an  immediate invasion, and kept no watch.
    One night, after dodging about and listening till he was nearly falling  asleep with weariness, he began to roll up his ball, for he had  resolved to go home to bed.
  It was not long, however, before he began  to feel bewildered.
  One after another he passed goblin houses, caves,  that is, occupied by goblin families, and at length was sure they were  many more than he had passed as he came.
  He had to use great caution  to pass unseen--they lay so close together.
 Could his string have led  him wrong?  He still followed winding it, and still it led him into  more thickly populated quarters, until he became quite uneasy, and  indeed apprehensive; for although he was not afraid of the cobs, he was  afraid of not finding his way out.
 But what could he do?  It was of no  use to sit down and wait for the morning--the morning made no  difference here.
  It was dark, and always dark; and if his string  failed him he was helpless.
  He might even arrive within a yard of the  mine and never know it.
 Seeing he could do nothing better he would at  least find where the end of his string was, and, if possible, how it  had come to play him such a trick.
  He knew by the size of the ball  that he was getting pretty near the last of it, when he began to feel a  tugging and pulling at it.
  What could it mean?  Turning a sharp  corner, he thought he heard strange sounds.
  These grew, as he went on,  to a scuffling and growling and squeaking; and the noise increased,  until, turning a second sharp corner, he found himself in the midst of  it, and the same moment tumbled over a wallowing mass, which he knew  must be a knot of the cobs' creatures.
  Before he could recover his  feet, he had caught some great scratches on his face and several severe  bites on his legs and arms.
  But as he scrambled to get up, his hand  fell upon his pickaxe, and before the horrid beasts could do him any  serious harm, he was laying about with it right and left in the dark.
  The hideous cries which followed gave him the satisfaction of knowing  that he had punished some of them pretty smartly for their rudeness,  and by their scampering and their retreating howls, he perceived that  he had routed them.
  He stood for a little, weighing his battle-axe in  his hand as if it had been the most precious lump of metal--but indeed  no lump of gold itself could have been so precious at the time as that  common tool--then untied the end of the string from it, put the ball in  his pocket, and still stood thinking.
  It was clear that the cobs'  creatures had found his axe, had between them carried it off, and had  so led him he knew not where.
  But for all his thinking he could not  tell what he ought to do, until suddenly he became aware of a glimmer  of light in the distance.
  Without a moment's hesitation he set out for  it, as fast as the unknown and rugged way would permit.
  Yet again  turning a corner, led by the dim light, he spied something quite new in  his experience of the underground regions--a small irregular shape of  something shining.
  Going up to it, he found it was a piece of mica, or  Muscovy glass, called sheep-silver in Scotland, and the light flickered  as if from a fire behind it.
  After trying in vain for some time to  discover an entrance to the place where it was burning, he came at  length to a small chamber in which an opening, high in the wall,  revealed a glow beyond.
  To this opening he managed to scramble up, and  then he saw a strange sight.
    Below sat a little group of goblins around a fire, the smoke of which  vanished in the darkness far aloft.
  The sides of the cave were full of  shining minerals like those of the palace hall; and the company was  evidently of a superior order, for every one wore stones about head, or  arms, or waist, shining dull gorgeous colours in the light of the fire.
  Nor had Curdie looked long before he recognized the king himself, and  found that he had made his way into the inner apartment of the royal  family.
  He had never had such a good chance of hearing something.
  He  crept through the hole as softly as he could, scrambled a good way down  the wall towards them without attracting attention, and then sat down  and listened.
 The king, evidently the queen, and probably the crown  prince and the Prime Minister were talking together.
  He was sure of  the queen by her shoes, for as she warmed her feet at the fire, he saw  them quite plainly.
    'That will be fun!' said the one he took for the crown prince.
 It was  the first whole sentence he heard.
    'I don't see why you should think it such a grand affair!' said his  stepmother, tossing her head backward.
    'You must remember, my spouse,' interposed His Majesty, as if making  excuse for his son, 'he has got the same blood in him.
  His mother--'    'Don't talk to me of his mother!  You positively encourage his  unnatural fancies.
  Whatever belongs to that mother ought to be cut out  of him.
'    'You forget yourself, my dear!' said the king.
    'I don't,' said the queen, 'nor you either.
  If you expect me to  approve of such coarse tastes, you will find yourself mistaken.
  I  don't wear shoes for nothing.
'    'You must acknowledge, however,' the king said, with a little groan,  'that this at least is no whim of Harelip's, but a matter of State  policy.
  You are well aware that his gratification comes purely from  the pleasure of sacrificing himself to the public good.
    Does it not, Harelip?'    'Yes, father; of course it does.
  Only it will be nice to make her cry.
  I'll have the skin taken off between her toes, and tie them up till  they grow together.
  Then her feet will be like other people's, and  there will be no occasion for her to wear shoes.
'    'Do you mean to insinuate I've got toes, you unnatural wretch?' cried  the queen; and she moved angrily towards Harelip.
  The councillor,  however, who was betwixt them, leaned forward so as to prevent her  touching him, but only as if to address the prince.
    'Your Royal Highness,' he said, 'possibly requires to be reminded that  you have got three toes yourself--one on one foot, two on the other.
'    'Ha! ha! ha!' shouted the queen triumphantly.
    The councillor, encouraged by this mark of favour, went on.
    'It seems to me, Your Royal Highness, it would greatly endear you to  your future people, proving to them that you are not the less one of  themselves that you had the misfortune to be born of a sun-mother, if  you were to command upon yourself the comparatively slight operation  which, in a more extended form, you so wisely meditate with regard to  your future princess.
'    'Ha! ha! ha!' laughed the queen louder than before, and the king and  the minister joined in the laugh.
  Harelip growled, and for a few  moments the others continued to express their enjoyment of his  discomfiture.
    The queen was the only one Curdie could see with any distinctness.
 She  sat sideways to him, and the light of the fire shone full upon her  face.
  He could not consider her handsome.
  Her nose was certainly  broader at the end than its extreme length, and her eyes, instead of  being horizontal, were set up like two perpendicular eggs, one on the  broad, the other on the small end.
  Her mouth was no bigger than a  small buttonhole until she laughed, when it stretched from ear to  ear--only, to be sure, her ears were very nearly in the middle of her  cheeks.
    Anxious to hear everything they might say, Curdie ventured to slide  down a smooth part of the rock just under him, to a projection below,  upon which he thought to rest.
  But whether he was not careful enough,  or the projection gave way, down he came with a rush on the floor of  the cavern, bringing with him a great rumbling shower of stones.
    The goblins jumped from their seats in more anger than consternation,  for they had never yet seen anything to be afraid of in the palace.
  But when they saw Curdie with his pick in his hand their rage was  mingled with fear, for they took him for the first of an invasion of  miners.
  The king notwithstanding drew himself up to his full height of  four feet, spread himself to his full breadth of three and a half, for  he was the handsomest and squarest of all the goblins, and strutting up  to Curdie, planted himself with outspread feet before him, and said  with dignity:    'Pray what right have you in my palace?'    'The right of necessity, Your Majesty,' answered Curdie.
  'I lost my  way and did not know where I was wandering to.
'    'How did you get in?'    'By a hole in the mountain.
'    'But you are a miner!  Look at your pickaxe!'    Curdie did look at it, answering:    'I came upon it lying on the ground a little way from here.
  I tumbled  over some wild beasts who were playing with it.
  Look, Your Majesty.
'  And Curdie showed him how he was scratched and bitten.
    The king was pleased to find him behave more politely than he had  expected from what his people had told him concerning the miners, for  he attributed it to the power of his own presence; but he did not  therefore feel friendly to the intruder.
    'You will oblige me by walking out of my dominions at once,' he said,  well knowing what a mockery lay in the words.
    'With pleasure, if Your Majesty will give me a guide,' said Curdie.
    'I will give you a thousand,' said the king with a scoffing air of  magnificent liberality.
    'One will be quite sufficient,' said Curdie.
    But the king uttered a strange shout, half halloo, half roar, and in  rushed goblins till the cave was swarming.
  He said something to the  first of them which Curdie could not hear, and it was passed from one  to another till in a moment the farthest in the crowd had evidently  heard and understood it.
  They began to gather about him in a way he  did not relish, and he retreated towards the wall.
 They pressed upon  him.
    'Stand back,' said Curdie, grasping his pickaxe tighter by his knee.
    They only grinned and pressed closer.
  Curdie bethought himself and  began to rhyme.
        'Ten, twenty, thirty--    You're all so very dirty!    Twenty, thirty, forty--    You're all so thick and snorty!    'Thirty, forty, fifty--    You're all so puff-and-snifty!    Forty, fifty, sixty--    Beast and man so mixty!      'Fifty, sixty, seventy--    Mixty, maxty, leaventy!    Sixty, seventy, eighty--    All your cheeks so slaty!      'Seventy, eighty, ninety,    All your hands so flinty!    Eighty, ninety, hundred,    Altogether dundred!'      The goblins fell back a little when he began, and made horrible  grimaces all through the rhyme, as if eating something so disagreeable  that it set their teeth on edge and gave them the creeps; but whether  it was that the rhyming words were most of them no words at all, for, a  new rhyme being considered the more efficacious, Curdie had made it on  the spur of the moment, or whether it was that the presence of the king  and queen gave them courage, I cannot tell; but the moment the rhyme  was over they crowded on him again, and out shot a hundred long arms,  with a multitude of thick nailless fingers at the ends of them, to lay  hold upon him.
  Then Curdie heaved up his axe.
  But being as gentle as  courageous and not wishing to kill any of them, he turned the end which  was square and blunt like a hammer, and with that came down a great  blow on the head of the goblin nearest him.
  Hard as the heads of all  goblins are, he thought he must feel that.
  And so he did, no doubt;  but he only gave a horrible cry, and sprung at Curdie's throat.
  Curdie, however, drew back in time, and just at that critical moment  remembered the vulnerable part of the goblin body.
  He made a sudden  rush at the king and stamped with all his might on His Majesty's feet.
  The king gave a most unkingly howl and almost fell into the fire.
  Curdie then rushed into the crowd, stamping right and left.
  The  goblins drew back, howling on every side as he approached, but they  were so crowded that few of those he attacked could escape his tread;  and the shrieking and roaring that filled the cave would have appalled  Curdie but for the good hope it gave him.
  They were tumbling over each  other in heaps in their eagerness to rush from the cave, when a new  assailant suddenly faced him--the queen, with flaming eyes and expanded  nostrils, her hair standing half up from her head, rushed at him.
 She  trusted in her shoes: they were of granite--hollowed like French  sabots.
  Curdie would have endured much rather than hurt a woman, even  if she was a goblin; but here was an affair of life and death:  forgetting her shoes, he made a great stamp on one of her feet.
  But  she instantly returned it with very different effect, causing him  frightful pain, and almost disabling him.
  His only chance with her  would have been to attack the granite shoes with his pickaxe, but  before he could think of that she had caught him up in her arms and was  rushing with him across the cave.
  She dashed him into a hole in the  wall, with a force that almost stunned him.
  But although he could not  move, he was not too far gone to hear her great cry, and the rush of  multitudes of soft feet, followed by the sounds of something heaved up  against the rock; after which came a multitudinous patter of stones  falling near him.
  The last had not ceased when he grew very faint, for  his head had been badly cut, and at last insensible.
    When he came to himself there was perfect silence about him, and utter  darkness, but for the merest glimmer in one tiny spot.
  He crawled to  it, and found that they had heaved a slab against the mouth of the  hole, past the edge of which a poor little gleam found its way from the  fire.
  He could not move it a hairbreadth, for they had piled a great  heap of stones against it.
  He crawled back to where he had been lying,  in the faint hope of finding his pickaxe, But after a vain search he  was at last compelled to acknowledge himself in an evil plight.
  He sat  down and tried to think, but soon fell fast asleep.
            Goblin Counsels    He must have slept a long time, for when he awoke he felt wonderfully  restored--indeed almost well--and very hungry.
  There were voices in  the outer cave.
    Once more, then, it was night; for the goblins slept during the day and  went about their affairs during the night.
    In the universal and constant darkness of their dwelling they had no  reason to prefer the one arrangement to the other; but from aversion to  the sun-people they chose to be busy when there was least chance of  their being met either by the miners below, when they were burrowing,  or by the people of the mountain above, when they were feeding their  sheep or catching their goats.
  And indeed it was only when the sun was  away that the outside of the mountain was sufficiently like their own  dismal regions to be endurable to their mole eyes, so thoroughly had  they become unaccustomed to any light beyond that of their own fires  and torches.
    Curdie listened, and soon found that they were talking of himself.
    'How long will it take?' asked Harelip.
    'Not many days, I should think,' answered the king.
  'They are poor  feeble creatures, those sun-people, and want to be always eating.
 We  can go a week at a time without food, and be all the better for it; but  I've been told they eat two or three times every day!  Can you believe  it?  They must be quite hollow inside--not at all like us, nine-tenths  of whose bulk is solid flesh and bone.
  Yes--I judge a week of  starvation will do for him.
'    'If I may be allowed a word,' interposed the queen,--'and I think I  ought to have some voice in the matter--'    'The wretch is entirely at your disposal, my spouse,' interrupted the  king.
  'He is your property.
  You caught him yourself.
  We should never  have done it.
'    The queen laughed.
  She seemed in far better humour than the night  before.
    'I was about to say,' she resumed, 'that it does seem a pity to waste  so much fresh meat.
'    'What are you thinking of, my love?' said the king.
  'The very notion  of starving him implies that we are not going to give him any meat,  either salt or fresh.
'    'I'm not such a stupid as that comes to,' returned Her Majesty.
 'What I  mean is that by the time he is starved there will hardly be a picking  upon his bones.
'    The king gave a great laugh.
    'Well, my spouse, you may have him when you like,' he said.
  'I don't  fancy him for my part.
  I am pretty sure he is tough eating.
'    'That would be to honour instead of punish his insolence,' returned the  queen.
  'But why should our poor creatures be deprived of so much  nourishment?  Our little dogs and cats and pigs and small bears would  enjoy him very much.
'    'You are the best of housekeepers, my lovely queen!' said her husband.
  'Let it be so by all means.
  Let us have our people in, and get him out  and kill him at once.
  He deserves it.
  The mischief he might have  brought upon us, now that he had penetrated so far as our most retired  citadel, is incalculable.
  Or rather let us tie him hand and foot, and  have the pleasure of seeing him torn to pieces by full torchlight in  the great hall.
'    'Better and better!' cried the queen and the prince together, both of  them clapping their hands.
  And the prince made an ugly noise with his  hare-lip, just as if he had intended to be one at the feast.
    'But,' added the queen, bethinking herself, 'he is so troublesome.
 For  poor creatures as they are, there is something about those sun-people  that is very troublesome.
  I cannot imagine how it is that with such  superior strength and skill and understanding as ours, we permit them  to exist at all.
  Why do we not destroy them entirely, and use their  cattle and grazing lands at our pleasure? Of course we don't want to  live in their horrid country!  It is far too glaring for our quieter  and more refined tastes.
  But we might use it as a sort of outhouse,  you know.
  Even our creatures' eyes might get used to it, and if they  did grow blind that would be of no consequence, provided they grew fat  as well.
  But we might even keep their great cows and other creatures,  and then we should have a few more luxuries, such as cream and cheese,  which at present we only taste occasionally, when our brave men have  succeeded in carrying some off from their farms.
'    'It is worth thinking of,' said the king; 'and I don't know why you  should be the first to suggest it, except that you have a positive  genius for conquest.
  But still, as you say, there is something very  troublesome about them; and it would be better, as I understand you to  suggest, that we should starve him for a day or two first, so that he  may be a little less frisky when we take him out.
'        'Once there was a goblin    Living in a hole;    Busy he was cobblin'    A shoe without a sole.
      'By came a birdie:    "Goblin, what do you do?"    "Cobble at a sturdie    Upper leather shoe.
"      '"What's the good o' that, Sir?"    Said the little bird.
    "Why it's very Pat, Sir--    Plain without a word.
      '"Where 'tis all a hole, Sir,    Never can be holes:    Why should their shoes have soles, Sir,    When they've got no souls?"'      'What's that horrible noise?' cried the queen, shuddering from  pot-metal head to granite shoes.
    'I declare,' said the king with solemn indignation, 'it's the  sun-creature in the hole!'    'Stop that disgusting noise!' cried the crown prince valiantly, getting  up and standing in front of the heap of stones, with his face towards  Curdie's prison.
  'Do now, or I'll break your head.
'    'Break away,' shouted Curdie, and began singing again:        'Once there was a goblin,    Living in a hole--'      'I really cannot bear it,' said the queen.
  'If I could only get at his  horrid toes with my slippers again!'    'I think we had better go to bed,' said the king.
    'It's not time to go to bed,' said the queen.
    'I would if I was you,' said Curdie.
    'Impertinent wretch!' said the queen, with the utmost scorn in her  voice.
    'An impossible if,' said His Majesty with dignity.
    'Quite,' returned Curdie, and began singing again:        'Go to bed,    Goblin, do.
    Help the queen    Take off her shoe.
      'If you do,    It will disclose    A horrid set    Of sprouting toes.
'      'What a lie!' roared the queen in a rage.
    'By the way, that reminds me,' said the king, 'that for as long as we  have been married, I have never seen your feet, queen.
  I think you  might take off your shoes when you go to bed!  They positively hurt me  sometimes.
'    'I will do as I like,' retorted the queen sulkily.
    'You ought to do as your own hubby wishes you,' said the king.
    'I will not,' said the queen.
    'Then I insist upon it,' said the king.
    Apparently His Majesty approached the queen for the purpose of  following the advice given by Curdie, for the latter heard a scuffle,  and then a great roar from the king.
    'Will you be quiet, then?' said the queen wickedly.
    'Yes, yes, queen.
  I only meant to coax you.
'    'Hands off!' cried the queen triumphantly.
  'I'm going to bed.
  You may  come when you like.
  But as long as I am queen I will sleep in my  shoes.
  It is my royal privilege.
  Harelip, go to bed.
'    'I'm going,' said Harelip sleepily.
    'So am I,' said the king.
    'Come along, then,' said the queen; 'and mind you are good, or I'll--'    'Oh, no, no, no!' screamed the king in the most supplicating of tones.
    Curdie heard only a muttered reply in the distance; and then the cave  was quite still.
    They had left the fire burning, and the light came through brighter  than before.
  Curdie thought it was time to try again if anything could  be done.
  But he found he could not get even a finger through the chink  between the slab and the rock.
  He gave a great rush with his shoulder  against the slab, but it yielded no more than if it had been part of  the rock.
  All he could do was to sit down and think again.
    By and by he came to the resolution to pretend to be dying, in the hope  they might take him out before his strength was too much exhausted to  let him have a chance.
  Then, for the creatures, if he could but find  his axe again, he would have no fear of them; and if it were not for  the queen's horrid shoes, he would have no fear at all.
    Meantime, until they should come again at night, there was nothing for  him to do but forge new rhymes, now his only weapons.
  He had no  intention of using them at present, of course; but it was well to have  a stock, for he might live to want them, and the manufacture of them  would help to while away the time.
            Irene's Clue    That same morning early, the princess woke in a terrible fright.
 There  was a hideous noise in her room--creatures snarling and hissing and  rocketing about as if they were fighting.
  The moment she came to  herself, she remembered something she had never thought of again--what  her grandmother told her to do when she was frightened.
  She  immediately took off her ring and put it under her pillow.
  As she did  so she fancied she felt a finger and thumb take it gently from under  her palm.
  'It must be my grandmother!' she said to herself, and the  thought gave her such courage that she stopped to put on her dainty  little slippers before running from the room.
  While doing this she  caught sight of a long cloak of sky-blue, thrown over the back of a  chair by the bedside.
  She had never seen it before but it was  evidently waiting for her.
  She put it on, and then, feeling with the  forefinger of her right hand, soon found her grandmother's thread,  which she proceeded at once to follow, expecting it would lead her  straight up the old stair.
 When she reached the door she found it went  down and ran along the floor, so that she had almost to crawl in order  to keep a hold of it.
  Then, to her surprise, and somewhat to her  dismay, she found that instead of leading her towards the stair it  turned in quite the opposite direction.
  It led her through certain  narrow passages towards the kitchen, turning aside ere she reached it,  and guiding her to a door which communicated with a small back yard.
  Some of the maids were already up, and this door was standing open.
  Across the yard the thread still ran along the ground, until it brought  her to a door in the wall which opened upon the Mountainside.
  When she  had passed through, the thread rose to about half her height, and she  could hold it with ease as she walked.
  It led her straight up the  mountain.
    The cause of her alarm was less frightful than she supposed.
  The  cook's great black cat, pursued by the housekeeper's terrier, had  bounced against her bedroom door, which had not been properly fastened,  and the two had burst into the room together and commenced a battle  royal.
  How the nurse came to sleep through it was a mystery, but I  suspect the old lady had something to do with it.
    It was a clear warm morning.
  The wind blew deliciously over the  Mountainside.
  Here and there she saw a late primrose but she did not  stop to call upon them.
  The sky was mottled with small clouds.
    The sun was not yet up, but some of their fluffy edges had caught his  light, and hung out orange and gold-coloured fringes upon the air.
  The  dew lay in round drops upon the leaves, and hung like tiny diamond  ear-rings from the blades of grass about her path.
    'How lovely that bit of gossamer is!' thought the princess, looking at  a long undulating line that shone at some distance from her up the  hill.
  It was not the time for gossamers though; and Irene soon  discovered that it was her own thread she saw shining on before her in  the light of the morning.
  It was leading her she knew not whither; but  she had never in her life been out before sunrise, and everything was  so fresh and cool and lively and full of something coming, that she  felt too happy to be afraid of anything.
    After leading her up a good distance, the thread turned to the left,  and down the path upon which she and Lootie had met Curdie.
 But she  never thought of that, for now in the morning light, with its far  outlook over the country, no path could have been more open and airy  and cheerful.
  She could see the road almost to the horizon, along  which she had so often watched her king-papa and his troop come  shining, with the bugle-blast cleaving the air before them; and it was  like a companion to her.
  Down and down the path went, then up, and  then down and then up again, getting rugged and more rugged as it went;  and still along the path went the silvery thread, and still along the  thread went Irene's little rosy-tipped forefinger.
  By and by she came  to a little stream that jabbered and prattled down the hill, and up the  side of the stream went both path and thread.
  And still the path grew  rougher and steeper, and the mountain grew wilder, till Irene began to  think she was going a very long way from home; and when she turned to  look back she saw that the level country had vanished and the rough  bare mountain had closed in about her.
  But still on went the thread,  and on went the princess.
  Everything around her was getting brighter  and brighter as the sun came nearer; till at length his first rays all  at once alighted on the top of a rock before her, like some golden  creature fresh from the sky.
  Then she saw that the little stream ran  out of a hole in that rock, that the path did not go past the rock, and  that the thread was leading her straight up to it.
  A shudder ran  through her from head to foot when she found that the thread was  actually taking her into the hole out of which the stream ran.
  It ran  out babbling joyously, but she had to go in.
    She did not hesitate.
  Right into the hole she went, which was high  enough to let her walk without stooping.
  For a little way there was a  brown glimmer, but at the first turn it all but ceased, and before she  had gone many paces she was in total darkness.
  Then she began to be  frightened indeed.
  Every moment she kept feeling the thread backwards  and forwards, and as she went farther and farther into the darkness of  the great hollow mountain, she kept thinking more and more about her  grandmother, and all that she had said to her, and how kind she had  been, and how beautiful she was, and all about her lovely room, and the  fire of roses, and the great lamp that sent its light through stone  walls.
  And she became more and more sure that the thread could not  have gone there of itself, and that her grandmother must have sent it.
  But it tried her dreadfully when the path went down very steep, and  especially When she came to places where she had to go down rough  stairs, and even sometimes a ladder.
  Through one narrow passage after  another, over lumps of rock and sand and clay, the thread guided her,  until she came to a small hole through which she had to creep.
  Finding  no change on the other side, 'Shall I ever get back?' she thought, over  and over again, wondering at herself that she was not ten times more  frightened, and often feeling as if she were only walking in the story  of a dream.
  Sometimes she heard the noise of water, a dull gurgling  inside the rock.
  By and by she heard the sounds of blows, which came  nearer and nearer; but again they grew duller, and almost died away.
  In a hundred directions she turned, obedient to the guiding thread.
    At last she spied a dull red shine, and came up to the mica window, and  thence away and round about, and right, into a cavern, where glowed the  red embers of a fire.
  Here the thread began to rise.
 It rose as high  as her head and higher still.
  What should she do if she lost her hold?  She was pulling it down: She might break it! She could see it far up,  glowing as red as her fire-opal in the light of the embers.
    But presently she came to a huge heap of stones, piled in a slope  against the wall of the cavern.
  On these she climbed, and soon  recovered the level of the thread only however to find, the next  moment, that it vanished through the heap of stones, and left her  standing on it, with her face to the solid rock.
  For one terrible  moment she felt as if her grandmother had forsaken her.
  The thread  which the spiders had spun far over the seas, which her grandmother had  sat in the moonlight and spun again for her, which she had tempered in  the rose-fire and tied to her opal ring, had left her--had gone where  she could no longer follow it--had brought her into a horrible cavern,  and there left her!  She was forsaken indeed!    'When shall I wake?' she said to herself in an agony, but the same  moment knew that it was no dream.
  She threw herself upon the heap, and  began to cry.
  It was well she did not know what creatures, one of them  with stone shoes on her feet, were lying in the next cave.
 But neither  did she know who was on the other side of the slab.
    At length the thought struck her that at least she could follow the  thread backwards, and thus get out of the mountain, and home.
  She rose  at once, and found the thread.
  But the instant she tried to feel it  backwards, it vanished from her touch.
  Forwards, it led her hand up to  the heap of stones--backwards it seemed nowhere.
 Neither could she see  it as before in the light of the fire.
  She burst into a wailing cry,  and again threw herself down on the stones.
            The Escape    As the princess lay and sobbed she kept feeling the thread  mechanically, following it with her finger many times up to the stones  in which it disappeared.
  By and by she began, still mechanically, to  poke her finger in after it between the stones as far as she could.
  All at once it came into her head that she might remove some of the  stones and see where the thread went next.
 Almost laughing at herself  for never having thought of this before, she jumped to her feet.
  Her  fear vanished; once more she was certain her grandmother's thread could  not have brought her there just to leave her there; and she began to  throw away the stones from the top as fast as she could, sometimes two  or three at a handful, sometimes taking both hands to lift one.
  After  clearing them away a little, she found that the thread turned and went  straight downwards.
  Hence, as the heap sloped a good deal, growing of  course wider towards its base, she had to throw away a multitude of  stones to follow the thread.
  But this was not all, for she soon found  that the thread, after going straight down for a little way, turned  first sideways in one direction, then sideways in another, and then  shot, at various angles, hither and thither inside the heap, so that  she began to be afraid that to clear the thread she must remove the  whole huge gathering.
  She was dismayed at the very idea, but, losing  no time, set to work with a will; and with aching back, and bleeding  fingers and hands, she worked on, sustained by the pleasure of seeing  the heap slowly diminish and begin to show itself on the opposite side  of the fire.
  Another thing which helped to keep up her courage was  that, as often as she uncovered a turn of the thread, instead of lying  loose upon the stone, it tightened up; this made her sure that her  grandmother was at the end of it somewhere.
    She had got about half-way down when she started, and nearly fell with  fright.
  Close to her ears as it seemed, a voice broke out singing:      'Jabber, bother, smash!    You'll have it all in a crash.
    Jabber, smash, bother!    You'll have the worst of the pother.
    Smash, bother, jabber!--'      Here Curdie stopped, either because he could not find a rhyme to  'jabber', or because he remembered what he had forgotten when he woke  up at the sound of Irene's labours, that his plan was to make the  goblins think he was getting weak.
  But he had uttered enough to let  Irene know who he was.
    'It's Curdie!' she cried joyfully.
    'Hush! hush!' came Curdie's voice again from somewhere.
  'Speak softly.
'    'Why, you were singing loud!' said Irene.
    'Yes.
  But they know I am here, and they don't know you are.
  Who are  you?'    'I'm Irene,' answered the princess.
  'I know who you are quite well.
  You're Curdie.
'    'Why, how ever did you come here, Irene?'    'My great-great-grandmother sent me; and I think I've found out why.
  You can't get out, I suppose?'    'No, I can't.
  What are you doing?'    'Clearing away a huge heap of stones.
'    'There's a princess!' exclaimed Curdie, in a tone of delight, but still  speaking in little more than a whisper.
  'I can't think how you got  here, though.
'    'My grandmother sent me after her thread.
'    'I don't know what you mean,' said Curdie; 'but so you're there, it  doesn't much matter.
'    'Oh, yes, it does!' returned Irene.
  'I should never have been here but  for her.
'    'You can tell me all about it when we get out, then.
  There's no time  to lose now,'said Curdie.
    And Irene went to work, as fresh as when she began.
    'There's such a lot of stones!' she said.
  'It will take me a long time  to get them all away.
'    'How far on have you got?' asked Curdie.
    'I've got about the half away, but the other half is ever so much  bigger.
'    'I don't think you will have to move the lower half.
  Do you see a slab  laid up against the wall?'    Irene looked, and felt about with her hands, and soon perceived the  outlines of the slab.
    'Yes,' she answered, 'I do.
'    'Then, I think,' rejoined Curdie, 'when you have cleared the slab about  half-way down, or a bit more, I shall be able to push it over.
'    'I must follow my thread,' returned Irene, 'whatever I do.
'    'What do you mean?' exclaimed Curdie.
 'You will see when you get out,'  answered the princess, and went on harder than ever.
    But she was soon satisfied that what Curdie wanted done and what the  thread wanted done were one and the same thing.
  For she not only saw  that by following the turns of the thread she had been clearing the  face of the slab, but that, a little more than half-way down, the  thread went through the chink between the slab and the wall into the  place where Curdie was confined, so that she could not follow it any  farther until the slab was out of her way.
 As soon as she found this,  she said in a right joyous whisper:    'Now, Curdie, I think if you were to give a great push, the slab would  tumble over.
'    'Stand quite clear of it, then,' said Curdie, 'and let me know when you  are ready.
'    Irene got off the heap, and stood on one side of it.
  'Now, Curdie!'  she cried.
    Curdie gave a great rush with his shoulder against it.
  Out tumbled the  slab on the heap, and out crept Curdie over the top of it.
    'You've saved my life, Irene!' he whispered.
    'Oh, Curdie! I'm so glad!  Let's get out of this horrid place as fast  as we can.
'    'That's easier said than done,' returned he.
    'Oh, no, it's quite easy,' said Irene.
  'We have only to follow my  thread.
  I am sure that it's going to take us out now.
'    She had already begun to follow it over the fallen slab into the hole,  while Curdie was searching the floor of the cavern for his pickaxe.
    'Here it is!' he cried.
  'No, it is not,' he added, in a disappointed  tone.
  'What can it be, then?  I declare it's a torch.
 That is jolly!  It's better almost than my pickaxe.
  Much better if it weren't for  those stone shoes!' he went on, as he lighted the torch by blowing the  last embers of the expiring fire.
    When he looked up, with the lighted torch casting a glare into the  great darkness of the huge cavern, he caught sight of Irene  disappearing in the hole out of which he had himself just come.
    'Where are you going there?' he cried.
  'That's not the way out.
 That's  where I couldn't get out.
'    'I know that,' whispered Irene.
  'But this is the way my thread goes,  and I must follow it.
'    'What nonsense the child talks!' said Curdie to himself.
  'I must  follow her, though, and see that she comes to no harm.
  She will soon  find she can't get out that way, and then she will come with me.
'    So he crept over the slab once more into the hole with his torch in his  hand.
  But when he looked about in it, he could see her nowhere.
  And  now he discovered that although the hole was narrow, it was much longer  than he had supposed; for in one direction the roof came down very low,  and the hole went off in a narrow passage, of which he could not see  the end.
  The princess must have crept in there.
  He got on his knees  and one hand, holding the torch with the other, and crept after her.
  The hole twisted about, in some parts so low that he could hardly get  through, in others so high that he could not see the roof, but  everywhere it was narrow--far too narrow for a goblin to get through,  and so I presume they never thought that Curdie might.
  He was  beginning to feel very uncomfortable lest something should have  befallen the princess, when he heard her voice almost close to his ear,  whispering:    'Aren't you coming, Curdie?'    And when he turned the next corner there she stood waiting for him.
    'I knew you couldn't go wrong in that narrow hole, but now you must  keep by me, for here is a great wide place,' she said.
    'I can't understand it,' said Curdie, half to himself, half to Irene.
    'Never mind,' she returned.
  'Wait till we get out.
'    Curdie, utterly astonished that she had already got so far, and by a  path he had known nothing of, thought it better to let her do as she  pleased.
  'At all events,' he said again to himself, 'I know nothing  about the way, miner as I am; and she seems to think she does know  something about it, though how she should passes my comprehension.
  So  she's just as likely to find her way as I am, and as she insists on  taking the lead, I must follow.
  We can't be much worse off than we  are, anyhow.
'  Reasoning thus, he followed her a few steps, and came  out in another great cavern, across which Irene walked in a straight  line, as confidently as if she knew every step of the way.
  Curdie went  on after her, flashing his torch about, and trying to see something of  what lay around them.
 Suddenly he started back a pace as the light fell  upon something close by which Irene was passing.
  It was a platform of  rock raised a few feet from the floor and covered with sheepskins, upon  which lay two horrible figures asleep, at once recognized by Curdie as  the king and queen of the goblins.
  He lowered his torch instantly lest  the light should awake them.
  As he did so it flashed upon his pickaxe,  lying by the side of the queen, whose hand lay close by the handle of  it.
    'Stop one moment,' he whispered.
  'Hold my torch, and don't let the  light on their faces.
'    Irene shuddered when she saw the frightful creatures, whom she had  passed without observing them, but she did as he requested, and turning  her back, held the torch low in front of her.
  Curdie drew his pickaxe  carefully away, and as he did so spied one of her feet, projecting from  under the skins.
  The great clumsy granite shoe, exposed thus to his  hand, was a temptation not to be resisted.
  He laid hold of it, and,  with cautious efforts, drew it off.
  The moment he succeeded, he saw to  his astonishment that what he had sung in ignorance, to annoy the  queen, was actually true: she had six horrible toes.
  Overjoyed at his  success, and seeing by the huge bump in the sheepskins where the other  foot was, he proceeded to lift them gently, for, if he could only  succeed in carrying away the other shoe as well, he would be no more  afraid of the goblins than of so many flies.
  But as he pulled at the  second shoe the queen gave a growl and sat up in bed.
  The same instant  the king awoke also and sat up beside her.
    'Run, Irene!' cried Curdie, for though he was not now in the least  afraid for himself, he was for the princess.
    Irene looked once round, saw the fearful creatures awake, and like the  wise princess she was, dashed the torch on the ground and extinguished  it, crying out:    'Here, Curdie, take my hand.
'    He darted to her side, forgetting neither the queen's shoe nor his  pickaxe, and caught hold of her hand, as she sped fearlessly where her  thread guided her.
  They heard the queen give a great bellow; but they  had a good start, for it would be some time before they could get  torches lighted to pursue them.
  Just as they thought they saw a gleam  behind them, the thread brought them to a very narrow opening, through  which Irene crept easily, and Curdie with difficulty.
    'Now,'said Curdie; 'I think we shall be safe.
'    'Of course we shall,' returned Irene.
  'Why do you think so?'asked  Curdie.
    'Because my grandmother is taking care of us.
'    'That's all nonsense,' said Curdie.
  'I don't know what you mean.
'    'Then if you don't know what I mean, what right have you to call it  nonsense?' asked the princess, a little offended.
    'I beg your pardon, Irene,' said Curdie; 'I did not mean to vex you.
'    'Of course not,' returned the princess.
  'But why do you think we shall  be safe?'    'Because the king and queen are far too stout to get through that hole.
'    'There might be ways round,' said the princess.
    'To be sure there might: we are not out of it yet,' acknowledged Curdie.
    'But what do you mean by the king and queen?' asked the princess.
 'I  should never call such creatures as those a king and a queen.
'    'Their own people do, though,' answered Curdie.
    The princess asked more questions, and Curdie, as they walked leisurely  along, gave her a full account, not only of the character and habits of  the goblins, so far as he knew them, but of his own adventures with  them, beginning from the very night after that in which he had met her  and Lootie upon the mountain.
  When he had finished, he begged Irene to  tell him how it was that she had come to his rescue.
  So Irene too had  to tell a long story, which she did in rather a roundabout manner,  interrupted by many questions concerning things she had not explained.
  But her tale, as he did not believe more than half of it, left  everything as unaccountable to him as before, and he was nearly as much  perplexed as to what he must think of the princess.
  He could not  believe that she was deliberately telling stories, and the only  conclusion he could come to was that Lootie had been playing the child  tricks, inventing no end of lies to frighten her for her own purposes.
    'But how ever did Lootie come to let you go into the mountains  alone?'he asked.
    'Lootie knows nothing about it.
  I left her fast asleep--at least I  think so.
  I hope my grandmother won't let her get into trouble, for it  wasn't her fault at all, as my grandmother very well knows.
'    'But how did you find your way to me?' persisted Curdie.
    'I told you already,' answered Irene; 'by keeping my finger upon my  grandmother's thread, as I am doing now.
'    'You don't mean you've got the thread there?'    'Of course I do.
  I have told you so ten times already.
  I have  hardly--except when I was removing the stones--taken my finger off it.
  There!' she added, guiding Curdie's hand to the thread, 'you feel it  yourself--don't you?'    'I feel nothing at all,' replied Curdie.
 'Then what can be the matter  with your finger?  I feel it perfectly.
  To be sure it is very thin,  and in the sunlight looks just like the thread of a spider, though  there are many of them twisted together to make it--but for all that I  can't think why you shouldn't feel it as well as I do.
'    Curdie was too polite to say he did not believe there was any thread  there at all.
  What he did say was:    'Well, I can make nothing of it.
'    'I can, though, and you must be glad of that, for it will do for both  of us.
'    'We're not out yet,' said Curdie.
    'We soon shall be,' returned Irene confidently.
  And now the thread  went downwards, and led Irene's hand to a hole in the floor of the  cavern, whence came a sound of running water which they had been  hearing for some time.
    'It goes into the ground now, Curdie,' she said, stopping.
    He had been listening to another sound, which his practised ear had  caught long ago, and which also had been growing louder.
  It was the  noise the goblin-miners made at their work, and they seemed to be at no  great distance now.
  Irene heard it the moment she stopped.
    'What is that noise?' she asked.
  'Do you know, Curdie?'    'Yes.
  It is the goblins digging and burrowing,' he answered.
    'And you don't know what they do it for?'    'No; I haven't the least idea.
  Would you like to see them?' he asked,  wishing to have another try after their secret.
    'If my thread took me there, I shouldn't much mind; but I don't want to  see them, and I can't leave my thread.
  It leads me down into the hole,  and we had better go at once.
'    'Very well.
  Shall I go in first?' said Curdie.
    'No; better not.
  You can't feel the thread,' she answered, stepping  down through a narrow break in the floor of the cavern.
 'Oh!' she  cried, 'I am in the water.
  It is running strong--but it is not deep,  and there is just room to walk.
  Make haste, Curdie.
'    He tried, but the hole was too small for him to get in.
    'Go on a little bit he said, shouldering his pickaxe.
  In a few moments  he had cleared a larger opening and followed her.
  They went on, down  and down with the running water, Curdie getting more and more afraid it  was leading them to some terrible gulf in the heart of the mountain.
  In one or two places he had to break away the rock to make room before  even Irene could get through--at least without hurting herself.
  But at  length they spied a glimmer of light, and in a minute more they were  almost blinded by the full sunlight, into which they emerged.
  It was  some little time before the princess could see well enough to discover  that they stood in her own garden, close by the seat on which she and  her king-papa had sat that afternoon.
  They had come out by the channel  of the little stream.
  She danced and clapped her hands with delight.
    'Now, Curdie!' she cried, 'won't you believe what I told you about my  grandmother and her thread?'    For she had felt all the time that Curdie was not believing what she  told him.
    'There!--don't you see it shining on before us?' she added.
    'I don't see anything,' persisted Curdie.
    'Then you must believe without seeing,' said the princess; 'for you  can't deny it has brought us out of the mountain.
'    'I can't deny we are out of the mountain, and I should be very  ungrateful indeed to deny that you had brought me out of it.
'    'I couldn't have done it but for the thread,' persisted Irene.
    'That's the part I don't understand.
'    'Well, come along, and Lootie will get you something to eat.
  I am sure  you must want it very much.
'    'Indeed I do.
  But my father and mother will be so anxious about me, I  must make haste--first up the mountain to tell my mother, and then down  into the mine again to let my father know.
'    'Very well, Curdie; but you can't get out without coming this way, and  I will take you through the house, for that is nearest.
'    They met no one by the way, for, indeed, as before, the people were  here and there and everywhere searching for the princess.
  When they  got in Irene found that the thread, as she had half expected, went up  the old staircase, and a new thought struck her.
  She turned to Curdie  and said:    'My grandmother wants me.
  Do come up with me and see her.
  Then you  will know that I have been telling you the truth.
  Do come--to please  me, Curdie.
  I can't bear you should think what I say is not true.
'    'I never doubted you believed what you said,' returned Curdie.
  'I only  thought you had some fancy in your head that was not correct.
' 'But do  come, dear Curdie.
'    The little miner could not withstand this appeal, and though he felt  shy in what seemed to him a huge grand house, he yielded, and followed  her up the stair.
            The Old Lady and Curdie    Up the stair then they went, and the next and the next, and through the  long rows of empty rooms, and up the little tower stair, Irene growing  happier and happier as she ascended.
  There was no answer when she  knocked at length at the door of the workroom, nor could she hear any  sound of the spinning-wheel, and once more her heart sank within her,  but only for one moment, as she turned and knocked at the other door.
    'Come in,' answered the sweet voice of her grandmother, and Irene  opened the door and entered, followed by Curdie.
    'You darling!' cried the lady, who was seated by a fire of red roses  mingled with white.
  'I've been waiting for you, and indeed getting a  little anxious about you, and beginning to think whether I had not  better go and fetch you myself.
'    As she spoke she took the little princess in her arms and placed her  upon her lap.
  She was dressed in white now, and looking if possible  more lovely than ever.
    'I've brought Curdie, grandmother.
  He wouldn't believe what I told him  and so I've brought him.
'    'Yes--I see him.
  He is a good boy, Curdie, and a brave boy.
 Aren't you  glad you've got him out?'    'Yes, grandmother.
  But it wasn't very good of him not to believe me  when I was telling him the truth.
'    'People must believe what they can, and those who believe more must not  be hard upon those who believe less.
  I doubt if you would have  believed it all yourself if you hadn't seen some of it.
'    'Ah! yes, grandmother, I dare say.
  I'm sure you are right.
  But he'll  believe now.
'    'I don't know that,' replied her grandmother.
    'Won't you, Curdie?' said Irene, looking round at him as she asked the  question.
  He was standing in the middle of the floor, staring, and  looking strangely bewildered.
  This she thought came of his  astonishment at the beauty of the lady.
    'Make a bow to my grandmother, Curdie,' she said.
    'I don't see any grandmother,' answered Curdie rather gruffly.
    'Don't see my grandmother, when I'm sitting in her lap?' exclaimed the  princess.
    'No, I don't,' reiterated Curdie, in an offended tone.
    'Don't you see the lovely fire of roses--white ones amongst them this  time?' asked Irene, almost as bewildered as he.
    'No, I don't,' answered Curdie, almost sulkily.
    'Nor the blue bed?  Nor the rose-coloured counterpane?--Nor the  beautiful light, like the moon, hanging from the roof?'    'You're making game of me, Your Royal Highness; and after what we have  come through together this day, I don't think it is kind of you,' said  Curdie, feeling very much hurt.
    'Then what do you see?' asked Irene, who perceived at once that for her  not to believe him was at least as bad as for him not to believe her.
    'I see a big, bare, garret-room--like the one in mother's cottage, only  big enough to take the cottage itself in, and leave a good margin all  round,' answered Curdie.
    'And what more do you see?'    'I see a tub, and a heap of musty straw, and a withered apple, and a  ray of sunlight coming through a hole in the middle of the roof and  shining on your head, and making all the place look a curious dusky  brown.
  I think you had better drop it, princess, and go down to the  nursery, like a good girl.
'    'But don't you hear my grandmother talking to me?' asked Irene, almost  crying.
    'No.
  I hear the cooing of a lot of pigeons.
  If you won't come down, I  will go without you.
  I think that will be better anyhow, for I'm sure  nobody who met us would believe a word we said to them.
  They would  think we made it all up.
  I don't expect anybody but my own father and  mother to believe me.
  They know I wouldn't tell a story.
'    'And yet you won't believe me, Curdie?' expostulated the princess, now  fairly crying with vexation and sorrow at the gulf between her and  Curdie.
    'No.
  I can't, and I can't help it,' said Curdie, turning to leave the  room.
    'What SHALL I do, grandmother?' sobbed the princess, turning her face  round upon the lady's bosom, and shaking with suppressed sobs.
    'You must give him time,' said her grandmother; 'and you must be  content not to be believed for a while.
  It is very hard to bear; but I  have had to bear it, and shall have to bear it many a time yet.
  I will  take care of what Curdie thinks of you in the end.
 You must let him go  now.
'    'You're not coming, are you?' asked Curdie.
    'No, Curdie; my grandmother says I must let you go.
  Turn to the right  when you get to the bottom of all the stairs, and that will take you to  the hall where the great door is.
'    'Oh! I don't doubt I can find my way--without you, princess, or your  old grannie's thread either,' said Curdie quite rudely.
    'Oh, Curdie!  Curdie!'    'I wish I had gone home at once.
  I'm very much obliged to you, Irene,  for getting me out of that hole, but I wish you hadn't made a fool of  me afterwards.
'    He said this as he opened the door, which he left open, and, without  another word, went down the stair.
  Irene listened with dismay to his  departing footsteps.
  Then turning again to the lady:    'What does it all mean, grandmother?' she sobbed, and burst into fresh  tears.
    'It means, my love, that I did not mean to show myself.
  Curdie is not  yet able to believe some things.
  Seeing is not believing--it is only  seeing.
  You remember I told you that if Lootie were to see me, she  would rub her eyes, forget the half she saw, and call the other half  nonsense.
'    'Yes; but I should have thought Curdie--'    'You are right.
  Curdie is much farther on than Lootie, and you will  see what will come of it.
  But in the meantime you must be content, I  say, to be misunderstood for a while.
  We are all very anxious to be  understood, and it is very hard not to be.
  But there is one thing much  more necessary.
'    'What is that, grandmother?'    'To understand other people.
'    'Yes, grandmother.
  I must be fair--for if I'm not fair to other  people, I'm not worth being understood myself.
  I see.
  So as Curdie  can't help it, I will not be vexed with him, but just wait.
'    'There's my own dear child,' said her grandmother, and pressed her  close to her bosom.
    'Why weren't you in your workroom when we came up, grandmother?' asked  Irene, after a few moments' silence.
    'If I had been there, Curdie would have seen me well enough.
  But why  should I be there rather than in this beautiful room?'    'I thought you would be spinning.
'    'I've nobody to spin for just at present.
  I never spin without knowing  for whom I am spinning.
'    'That reminds me--there is one thing that puzzles me,' said the  princess: 'how are you to get the thread out of the mountain again?  Surely you won't have to make another for me?  That would be such a  trouble!'    The lady set her down and rose and went to the fire.
  Putting in her  hand, she drew it out again and held up the shining ball between her  finger and thumb.
    'I've got it now, you see,' she said, coming back to the princess, 'all  ready for you when you want it.
'    Going to her cabinet, she laid it in the same drawer as before.
    'And here is your ring,' she added, taking it from the little finger of  her left hand and putting it on the forefinger of Irene's right hand.
    'Oh, thank you, grandmother! I feel so safe now!'    'You are very tired, my child,' the lady went on.
  'Your hands are hurt  with the stones, and I have counted nine bruises on you.
  Just look  what you are like.
'    And she held up to her a little mirror which she had brought from the  cabinet.
  The princess burst into a merry laugh at the sight.
 She was  so draggled with the stream and dirty with creeping through narrow  places, that if she had seen the reflection without knowing it was a  reflection, she would have taken herself for some gipsy child whose  face was washed and hair combed about once in a month.
 The lady laughed  too, and lifting her again upon her knee, took off her cloak and  night-gown.
  Then she carried her to the side of the room.
  Irene  wondered what she was going to do with her, but asked no  questions--only starting a little when she found that she was going to  lay her in the large silver bath; for as she looked into it, again she  saw no bottom, but the stars shining miles away, as it seemed, in a  great blue gulf.
  Her hands closed involuntarily on the beautiful arms  that held her, and that was all.
    The lady pressed her once more to her bosom, saying:    'Do not be afraid, my child.
'    'No, grandmother,' answered the princess, with a little gasp; and the  next instant she sank in the clear cool water.
    When she opened her eyes, she saw nothing but a strange lovely blue  over and beneath and all about her.
  The lady, and the beautiful room,  had vanished from her sight, and she seemed utterly alone.
 But instead  of being afraid, she felt more than happy--perfectly blissful.
  And  from somewhere came the voice of the lady, singing a strange sweet  song, of which she could distinguish every word; but of the sense she  had only a feeling--no understanding.
  Nor could she remember a single  line after it was gone.
  It vanished, like the poetry in a dream, as  fast as it came.
  In after years, however, she would sometimes fancy  that snatches of melody suddenly rising in her brain must be little  phrases and fragments of the air of that song; and the very fancy would  make her happier, and abler to do her duty.
    How long she lay in the water she did not know.
  It seemed a long  time--not from weariness but from pleasure.
  But at last she felt the  beautiful hands lay hold of her, and through the gurgling water she was  lifted out into the lovely room.
  The lady carried her to the fire, and  sat down with her in her lap, and dried her tenderly with the softest  towel.
  It was so different from Lootie's drying.
 When the lady had  done, she stooped to the fire, and drew from it her night-gown, as  white as snow.
    'How delicious!' exclaimed the princess.
  'It smells of all the roses  in the world, I think.
'    When she stood up on the floor she felt as if she had been made over  again.
  Every bruise and all weariness were gone, and her hands were  soft and whole as ever.
    'Now I am going to put you to bed for a good sleep,' said her  grandmother.
    'But what will Lootie be thinking?  And what am I to say to her when  she asks me where I have been?'    'Don't trouble yourself about it.
  You will find it all come right,'  said her grandmother, and laid her into the blue bed, under the rosy  counterpane.
    'There is just one thing more,' said Irene.
  'I am a little anxious  about Curdie.
  As I brought him into the house, I ought to have seen  him safe on his way home.
'    'I took care of all that,' answered the lady.
  'I told you to let him  go, and therefore I was bound to look after him.
  Nobody saw him, and  he is now eating a good dinner in his mother's cottage far up in the  mountain.
'    'Then I will go to sleep,' said Irene, and in a few minutes she was  fast asleep.
            Curdie and His Mother    Curdie went up the mountain neither whistling nor singing, for he was  vexed with Irene for taking him in, as he called it; and he was vexed  with himself for having spoken to her so angrily.
  His mother gave a  cry of joy when she saw him, and at once set about getting him  something to eat, asking him questions all the time, which he did not  answer so cheerfully as usual.
  When his meal was ready, she left him  to eat it, and hurried to the mine to let his father know he was safe.
  When she came back, she found him fast asleep upon her bed; nor did he  wake until his father came home in the evening.
    'Now, Curdie,' his mother said, as they sat at supper, 'tell us the  whole story from beginning to end, just as it all happened.
'    Curdie obeyed, and told everything to the point where they came out  upon the lawn in the garden of the king's house.
    'And what happened after that?' asked his mother.
  'You haven't told us  all.
  You ought to be very happy at having got away from those demons,  and instead of that I never saw you so gloomy.
  There must be something  more.
  Besides, you do not speak of that lovely child as I should like  to hear you.
  She saved your life at the risk of her own, and yet  somehow you don't seem to think much of it.
'    'She talked such nonsense' answered Curdie, 'and told me a pack of  things that weren't a bit true; and I can't get over it.
'    'What were they?' asked his father.
  'Your mother may be able to throw  some light upon them.
'    Then Curdie made a clean breast of it, and told them everything.
    They all sat silent for some time, pondering the strange tale.
  At last  Curdie's mother spoke.
    'You confess, my boy,' she said, 'there is something about the whole  affair you do not understand?'    'Yes, of course, mother,' he answered.
  'I cannot understand how a  child knowing nothing about the mountain, or even that I was shut up in  it, should come all that way alone, straight to where I was; and then,  after getting me out of the hole, lead me out of the mountain too,  where I should not have known a step of the way if it had been as light  as in the open air.
'    'Then you have no right to say what she told you was not true.
  She did  take you out, and she must have had something to guide her: why not a  thread as well as a rope, or anything else?  There is something you  cannot explain, and her explanation may be the right one.
'    'It's no explanation at all, mother; and I can't believe it.
'    'That may be only because you do not understand it.
  If you did, you  would probably find it was an explanation, and believe it thoroughly.
  I don't blame you for not being able to believe it, but I do blame you  for fancying such a child would try to deceive you.
  Why should she?  Depend upon it, she told you all she knew.
 Until you had found a better  way of accounting for it all, you might at least have been more sparing  of your judgement.
'    'That is what something inside me has been saying all the time,' said  Curdie, hanging down his head.
  'But what do you make of the  grandmother?  That is what I can't get over.
  To take me up to an old  garret, and try to persuade me against the sight of my own eyes that it  was a beautiful room, with blue walls and silver stars, and no end of  things in it, when there was nothing there but an old tub and a  withered apple and a heap of straw and a sunbeam!  It was too bad!  She  might have had some old woman there at least to pass for her precious  grandmother!'    'Didn't she speak as if she saw those other things herself, Curdie?'    'Yes.
  That's what bothers me.
  You would have thought she really meant  and believed that she saw every one of the things she talked about.
  And not one of them there!  It was too bad, I say.
'    'Perhaps some people can see things other people can't see, Curdie,'  said his mother very gravely.
  'I think I will tell you something I saw  myself once--only Perhaps You won't believe me either!'    'Oh, mother, mother!' cried Curdie, bursting into tears; 'I don't  deserve that, surely!'    'But what I am going to tell you is very strange,' persisted his  mother; 'and if having heard it you were to say I must have been  dreaming, I don't know that I should have any right to be vexed with  you, though I know at least that I was not asleep.
'    'Do tell me, mother.
  Perhaps it will help me to think better of the  princess.
'    'That's why I am tempted to tell you,' replied his mother.
  'But first,  I may as well mention that, according to old whispers, there is  something more than common about the king's family; and the queen was  of the same blood, for they were cousins of some degree.
 There were  strange stories told concerning them--all good stories--but strange,  very strange.
  What they were I cannot tell, for I only remember the  faces of my grandmother and my mother as they talked together about  them.
  There was wonder and awe--not fear--in their eyes, and they  whispered, and never spoke aloud.
  But what I saw myself was this: Your  father was going to work in the mine one night, and I had been down  with his supper.
  It was soon after we were married, and not very long  before you were born.
  He came with me to the mouth of the mine, and  left me to go home alone, for I knew the way almost as well as the  floor of our own cottage.
  It was pretty dark, and in some parts of the  road where the rocks overhung nearly quite dark.
  But I got along  perfectly well, never thinking of being afraid, until I reached a spot  you know well enough, Curdie, where the path has to make a sharp turn  out of the way of a great rock on the left-hand side.
  When I got  there, I was suddenly surrounded by about half a dozen of the cobs, the  first I had ever seen, although I had heard tell of them often enough.
  One of them blocked up the path, and they all began tormenting and  teasing me in a way it makes me shudder to think of even now.
'    'If I had only been with you!' cried father and son in a breath.
    The mother gave a funny little smile, and went on.
    'They had some of their horrible creatures with them too, and I must  confess I was dreadfully frightened.
  They had torn my clothes very  much, and I was afraid they were going to tear myself to pieces, when  suddenly a great white soft light shone upon me.
  I looked up.
  A broad  ray, like a shining road, came down from a large globe of silvery  light, not very high up, indeed not quite so high as the horizon--so it  could not have been a new star or another moon or anything of that  sort.
  The cobs dropped persecuting me, and looked dazed, and I thought  they were going to run away, but presently they began again.
  The same  moment, however, down the path from the globe of light came a bird,  shining like silver in the sun.
  It gave a few rapid flaps first, and  then, with its wings straight out, shot, sliding down the slope of the  light.
  It looked to me just like a white pigeon.
  But whatever it was,  when the cobs caught sight of it coming straight down upon them, they  took to their heels and scampered away across the mountain, leaving me  safe, only much frightened.
  As soon as it had sent them off, the bird  went gliding again up the light, and the moment it reached the globe  the light disappeared, just as if a shutter had been closed over a  window, and I saw it no More.
  But I had no more trouble with the cobs  that night or ever after.
'    'How strange!' exclaimed Curdie.
    'Yes, it was strange; but I can't help believing it, whether you do or  not,' said his mother.
    'It's exactly as your mother told it to me the very next morning,' said  his father.
    'You don't think I'm doubting my own mother?' cried Curdie.
 'There are  other people in the world quite as well worth believing as your own  mother,' said his mother.
  'I don't know that she's so much the fitter  to be believed that she happens to be your mother, Mr. Curdie.
  There  are mothers far more likely to tell lies than the little girl I saw  talking to the primroses a few weeks ago.
  If she were to lie I should  begin to doubt my own word.
'    'But princesses have told lies as well as other people,' said Curdie.
    'Yes, but not princesses like that child.
  She's a good girl, I am  certain, and that's more than being a princess.
  Depend upon it you  will have to be sorry for behaving so to her, Curdie.
  You ought at  least to have held your tongue.
'    'I am sorry now,' answered Curdie.
    'You ought to go and tell her so, then.
'    'I don't see how I could manage that.
  They wouldn't let a miner boy  like me have a word with her alone; and I couldn't tell her before that  nurse of hers.
  She'd be asking ever so many questions, and I don't  know how many the little princess would like me to answer.
  She told me  that Lootie didn't know anything about her coming to get me out of the  mountain.
  I am certain she would have prevented her somehow if she had  known it.
  But I may have a chance before long, and meantime I must try  to do something for her.
  I think, father, I have got on the track at  last.
'    'Have you, indeed, my boy?' said Peter.
  'I am sure you deserve some  success; you have worked very hard for it.
  What have you found out?'    'It's difficult, you know, father, inside the mountain, especially in  the dark, and not knowing what turns you have taken, to tell the lie of  things outside.
'    'Impossible, my boy, without a chart, or at least a compass,' returned  his father.
    'Well, I think I have nearly discovered in what direction the cobs are  mining.
  If I am right, I know something else that I can put to it, and  then one and one will make three.
'    'They very often do, Curdie, as we miners ought to be very well aware.
  Now tell us, my boy, what the two things are, and see whether we can  guess at the same third as you.
'    'I don't see what that has to do with the princess,' interposed his  mother.
    'I will soon let you see that, mother.
  Perhaps you may think me  foolish, but until I am sure there, is nothing in my present fancy, I  am more determined than ever to go on with my observations.
  Just as we  came to the channel by which we got out, I heard the miners at work  somewhere near--I think down below us.
  Now since I began to watch  them, they have mined a good half-mile, in a straight line; and so far  as I am aware, they are working in no other part of the mountain.
  But  I never could tell in what direction they were going.
  When we came out  in the king's garden, however, I thought at once whether it was  possible they were working towards the king's house; and what I want to  do tonight is to make sure whether they are or not.
  I will take a  light with me--'    'Oh, Curdie,' cried his mother, 'then they will see you.
'    'I'm no more afraid of them now than I was before,' rejoined Curdie,  'now that I've got this precious shoe.
  They can't make another such in  a hurry, and one bare foot will do for my purpose.
 Woman as she may be,  I won't spare her next time.
  But I shall be careful with my light, for  I don't want them to see me.
  I won't stick it in my hat.
'    'Go on, then, and tell us what you mean to do.
'    'I mean to take a bit of paper with me and a pencil, and go in at the  mouth of the stream by which we came out.
  I shall mark on the paper as  near as I can the angle of every turning I take until I find the cobs  at work, and so get a good idea in what direction they are going.
  If  it should prove to be nearly parallel with the stream, I shall know it  is towards the king's house they are working.
'    'And what if you should?  How much wiser will you be then?'    'Wait a minute, mother dear.
  I told you that when I came upon the  royal family in the cave, they were talking of their prince--Harelip,  they called him--marrying a sun-woman--that means one of us--one with  toes to her feet.
  Now in the speech one of them made that night at  their great gathering, of which I heard only a part, he said that peace  would be secured for a generation at least by the pledge the prince  would hold for the good behaviour of her relatives: that's what he  said, and he must have meant the sun-woman the prince was to marry.
  I  am quite sure the king is much too proud to wish his son to marry any  but a princess, and much too knowing to fancy that his having a peasant  woman for a wife would be of any great advantage to them.
'    'I see what you are driving at now,' said his mother.
    'But,' said his father, 'our king would dig the mountain to the plain  before he would have his princess the wife of a cob, if he were ten  times a prince.
'    'Yes; but they think so much of themselves!' said his mother.
 'Small  creatures always do.
  The bantam is the proudest cock in my little  yard.
'    'And I fancy,' said Curdie, 'if they once got her, they would tell the  king they would kill her except he consented to the marriage.
'    'They might say so,' said his father, 'but they wouldn't kill her; they  would keep her alive for the sake of the hold it gave them over our  king.
  Whatever he did to them, they would threaten to do the same to  the princess.
'    'And they are bad enough to torment her just for their own amusement--I  know that,' said his mother.
    'Anyhow, I will keep a watch on them, and see what they are up to,'  said Curdie.
  'It's too horrible to think of.
  I daren't let myself do  it.
  But they shan't have her--at least if I can help it.
  So, mother  dear--my clue is all right--will you get me a bit of paper and a pencil  and a lump of pease pudding, and I will set out at once.
  I saw a place  where I can climb over the wall of the garden quite easily.
'    'You must mind and keep out of the way of the men on the watch,' said  his mother.
    'That I will.
  I don't want them to know anything about it.
  They would  spoil it all.
  The cobs would only try some other plan--they are such  obstinate creatures!  I shall take good care, mother.
 They won't kill  and eat me either, if they should come upon me.
  So you needn't mind  them.
'    His mother got him what he had asked for, and Curdie set out.
 Close  beside the door by which the princess left the garden for the mountain  stood a great rock, and by climbing it Curdie got over the wall.
  He  tied his clue to a stone just inside the channel of the stream, and  took his pickaxe with him.
  He had not gone far before he encountered a  horrid creature coming towards the mouth.
  The spot was too narrow for  two of almost any size or shape, and besides Curdie had no wish to let  the creature pass.
  Not being able to use his pickaxe, however, he had  a severe struggle with him, and it was only after receiving many bites,  some of them bad, that he succeeded in killing him with his  pocket-knife.
  Having dragged him out, he made haste to get in again  before another should stop up the way.
    I need not follow him farther in this night's adventures.
  He returned  to his breakfast, satisfied that the goblins were mining in the  direction of the palace--on so low a level that their intention must,  he thought, be to burrow under the walls of the king's house, and rise  up inside it--in order, he fully believed, to lay hands on the little  princess, and carry her off for a wife to their horrid Harelip.
            Irene Behaves Like a Princess    When the princess awoke from the sweetest of sleeps, she found her  nurse bending over her, the housekeeper looking over the nurse's  shoulder, and the laundry-maid looking over the housekeeper's.
 The room  was full of women-servants; and the gentlemen-at-arms, with a long  column of servants behind them, were peeping, or trying to peep in at  the door of the nursery.
    'Are those horrid creatures gone?' asked the princess, remembering  first what had terrified her in the morning.
    'You naughty, naughty little princess!' cried Lootie.
    Her face was very pale, with red streaks in it, and she looked as if  she were going to shake her; but Irene said nothing--only waited to  hear what should come next.
    'How could you get under the clothes like that, and make us all fancy  you were lost!  And keep it up all day too!  You are the most obstinate  child!  It's anything but fun to us, I can tell you!'    It was the only way the nurse could account for her disappearance.
    'I didn't do that, Lootie,' said Irene, very quietly.
    'Don't tell stories!' cried her nurse quite rudely.
    'I shall tell you nothing at all,' said Irene.
    'That's just as bad,' said the nurse.
    'Just as bad to say nothing at all as to tell stories?' exclaimed the  princess.
  'I will ask my papa about that.
  He won't say so.
 And I  don't think he will like you to say so.
'    'Tell me directly what you mean by it!' screamed the nurse, half wild  with anger at the princess and fright at the possible consequences to  herself.
    'When I tell you the truth, Lootie,' said the princess, who somehow did  not feel at all angry, 'you say to me "Don't tell stories": it seems I  must tell stories before you will believe me.
'    'You are very rude, princess,' said the nurse.
    'You are so rude, Lootie, that I will not speak to you again till you  are sorry.
  Why should I, when I know you will not believe me?'  returned the princess.
  For she did know perfectly well that if she  were to tell Lootie what she had been about, the more she went on to  tell her, the less would she believe her.
    'You are the most provoking child!' cried her nurse.
  'You deserve to  be well punished for your wicked behaviour.
'    'Please, Mrs Housekeeper,' said the princess, 'will you take me to your  room, and keep me till my king-papa comes?  I will ask him to come as  soon as he can.
'    Every one stared at these words.
  Up to this moment they had all  regarded her as little more than a baby.
    But the housekeeper was afraid of the nurse, and sought to patch  matters up, saying:    'I am sure, princess, nursie did not mean to be rude to you.
'    'I do not think my papa would wish me to have a nurse who spoke to me  as Lootie does.
  If she thinks I tell lies, she had better either say  so to my papa, or go away.
  Sir Walter, will you take charge of me?'    'With the greatest of pleasure, princess,' answered the captain of the  gentlemen-at-arms, walking with his great stride into the room.
    The crowd of servants made eager way for him, and he bowed low before  the little princess's bed.
  'I shall send my servant at once, on the  fastest horse in the stable, to tell your king-papa that Your Royal  Highness desires his presence.
  When you have chosen one of these  under-servants to wait upon you, I shall order the room to be cleared.
'    'Thank you very much, Sir Walter,' said the princess, and her eye  glanced towards a rosy-cheeked girl who had lately come to the house as  a scullery-maid.
    But when Lootie saw the eyes of her dear princess going in search of  another instead of her, she fell upon her knees by the bedside, and  burst into a great cry of distress.
    'I think, Sir Walter,' said the princess, 'I will keep Lootie.
  But I  put myself under your care; and you need not trouble my king-papa until  I speak to you again.
  Will you all please to go away?  I am quite safe  and well, and I did not hide myself for the sake either of amusing  myself, or of troubling my people.
  Lootie, will you please to dress  me.
'            Curdie Comes to Grief    Everything was for some time quiet above ground.
  The king was still  away in a distant part of his dominions.
  The men-at-arms kept watching  about the house.
  They had been considerably astonished by finding at  the foot of the rock in the garden the hideous body of the goblin  creature killed by Curdie; but they came to the conclusion that it had  been slain in the mines, and had crept out there to die; and except an  occasional glimpse of a live one they saw nothing to cause alarm.
  Curdie kept watching in the mountain, and the goblins kept burrowing  deeper into the earth.
  As long as they went deeper there was, Curdie  judged, no immediate danger.
    To Irene the summer was as full of pleasure as ever, and for a long  time, although she often thought of her grandmother during the day, and  often dreamed about her at night, she did not see her.
  The kids and  the flowers were as much her delight as ever, and she made as much  friendship with the miners' children she met on the mountain as Lootie  would permit; but Lootie had very foolish notions concerning the  dignity of a princess, not understanding that the truest princess is  just the one who loves all her brothers and sisters best, and who is  most able to do them good by being humble towards them.
  At the same  time she was considerably altered for the better in her behaviour to  the princess.
  She could not help seeing that she was no longer a mere  child, but wiser than her age would account for.
  She kept foolishly  whispering to the servants, however--sometimes that the princess was  not right in her mind, sometimes that she was too good to live, and  other nonsense of the same sort.
    All this time Curdie had to be sorry, without a chance of confessing,  that he had behaved so unkindly to the princess.
  This perhaps made him  the more diligent in his endeavours to serve her.
 His mother and he  often talked on the subject, and she comforted him, and told him she  was sure he would some day have the opportunity he so much desired.
    Here I should like to remark, for the sake of princes and princesses in  general, that it is a low and contemptible thing to refuse to confess a  fault, or even an error.
  If a true princess has done wrong, she is  always uneasy until she has had an opportunity of throwing the  wrongness away from her by saying: 'I did it; and I wish I had not; and  I am sorry for having done it.
' So you see there is some ground for  supposing that Curdie was not a miner only, but a prince as well.
  Many  such instances have been known in the world's history.
    At length, however, he began to see signs of a change in the  proceedings of the goblin excavators: they were going no deeper, but  had commenced running on a level; and he watched them, therefore, more  closely than ever.
  All at once, one night, coming to a slope of very  hard rock, they began to ascend along the inclined plane of its  surface.
  Having reached its top, they went again on a level for a  night or two, after which they began to ascend once more, and kept on  at a pretty steep angle.
  At length Curdie judged it time to transfer  his observation to another quarter, and the next night he did not go to  the mine at all; but, leaving his pickaxe and clue at home, and taking  only his usual lumps of bread and pease pudding, went down the mountain  to the king's house.
  He climbed over the wall, and remained in the  garden the whole night, creeping on hands and knees from one spot to  the other, and lying at full length with his ear to the ground,  listening.
  But he heard nothing except the tread of the men-at-arms as  they marched about, whose observation, as the night was cloudy and  there was no moon, he had little difficulty in avoiding.
  For several  following nights he continued to haunt the garden and listen, but with  no success.
    At length, early one evening, whether it was that he had got careless  of his own safety, or that the growing moon had become strong enough to  expose him, his watching came to a sudden end.
  He was creeping from  behind the rock where the stream ran out, for he had been listening all  round it in the hope it might convey to his ear some indication of the  whereabouts of the goblin miners, when just as he came into the  moonlight on the lawn, a whizz in his ear and a blow upon his leg  startled him.
  He instantly squatted in the hope of eluding further  notice.
  But when he heard the sound of running feet, he jumped up to  take the chance of escape by flight.
 He fell, however, with a keen  shoot of pain, for the bolt of a crossbow had wounded his leg, and the  blood was now streaming from it.
  He was instantly laid Hold of by two  or three of the men-at-arms.
  It was useless to struggle, and he  submitted in silence.
    'It's a boy!' cried several of them together, in a tone of amazement.
  'I thought it was one of those demons.
  What are you about here?'    'Going to have a little rough usage, apparently,' said Curdie,  laughing, as the men shook him.
    'Impertinence will do you no good.
  You have no business here in the  king's grounds, and if you don't give a true account of yourself, you  shall fare as a thief.
'    'Why, what else could he be?' said one.
    'He might have been after a lost kid, you know,' suggested another.
    'I see no good in trying to excuse him.
  He has no business here,  anyhow.
'    'Let me go away, then, if you please,' said Curdie.
    'But we don't please--not except you give a good account of yourself.
'    'I don't feel quite sure whether I can trust you,' said Curdie.
    'We are the king's own men-at-arms,' said the captain courteously, for  he was taken with Curdie's appearance and courage.
    'Well, I will tell you all about it--if you will promise to listen to  me and not do anything rash.
'    'I call that cool!' said one of the party, laughing.
  'He will tell us  what mischief he was about, if we promise to do as pleases him.
'    'I was about no mischief,' said Curdie.
    But ere he could say more he turned faint, and fell senseless on the  grass.
  Then first they discovered that the bolt they had shot, taking  him for one of the goblin creatures, had wounded him.
    They carried him into the house and laid him down in the hall.
  The  report spread that they had caught a robber, and the servants crowded  in to see the villain.
  Amongst the rest came the nurse.
 The moment she  saw him she exclaimed with indignation:    'I declare it's the same young rascal of a miner that was rude to me  and the princess on the mountain.
  He actually wanted to kiss the  princess.
  I took good care of that--the wretch!  And he was prowling  about, was he?  Just like his impudence!' The princess being fast  asleep, she could misrepresent at her pleasure.
    When he heard this, the captain, although he had considerable doubt of  its truth, resolved to keep Curdie a prisoner until they could search  into the affair.
  So, after they had brought him round a little, and  attended to his wound, which was rather a bad one, they laid him, still  exhausted from the loss of blood, upon a mattress in a disused  room--one of those already so often mentioned--and locked the door, and  left him.
  He passed a troubled night, and in the morning they found  him talking wildly.
  In the evening he came to himself, but felt very  weak, and his leg was exceedingly painful.
  Wondering where he was, and  seeing one of the men-at-arms in the room, he began to question him and  soon recalled the events of the preceding night.
  As he was himself  unable to watch any more, he told the soldier all he knew about the  goblins, and begged him to tell his companions, and stir them up to  watch with tenfold vigilance; but whether it was that he did not talk  quite coherently, or that the whole thing appeared incredible,  certainly the man concluded that Curdie was only raving still, and  tried to coax him into holding his tongue.
  This, of course, annoyed  Curdie dreadfully, who now felt in his turn what it was not to be  believed, and the consequence was that his fever returned, and by the  time when, at his persistent entreaties, the captain was called, there  could be no doubt that he was raving.
  They did for him what they  could, and promised everything he wanted, but with no intention of  fulfilment.
  At last he went to sleep, and when at length his sleep  grew profound and peaceful, they left him, locked the door again, and  withdrew, intending to revisit him early in the morning.
            The Goblin-Miners    That same night several of the servants were having a chat together  before going to bed.
    'What can that noise be?' said one of the housemaids, who had been  listening for a moment or two.
    'I've heard it the last two nights,' said the cook.
  'If there were any  about the place, I should have taken it for rats, but my Tom keeps them  far enough.
'    'I've heard, though,' said the scullery-maid, 'that rats move about in  great companies sometimes.
  There may be an army of them invading us.
  I've heard the noises yesterday and today too.
'    'It'll be grand fun, then, for my Tom and Mrs Housekeeper's Bob,' said  the cook.
  'They'll be friends for once in their lives, and fight on  the same side.
  I'll engage Tom and Bob together will put to flight any  number of rats.
'    'It seems to me,' said the nurse, 'that the noises are much too loud  for that.
  I have heard them all day, and my princess has asked me  several times what they could be.
  Sometimes they sound like distant  thunder, and sometimes like the noises you hear in the mountain from  those horrid miners underneath.
'    'I shouldn't wonder,' said the cook, 'if it was the miners after all.
  They may have come on some hole in the mountain through which the  noises reach to us.
  They are always boring and blasting and breaking,  you know.
'    As he spoke, there came a great rolling rumble beneath them, and the  house quivered.
  They all started up in affright, and rushing to the  hall found the gentlemen-at-arms in consternation also.
 They had sent  to wake their captain, who said from their description that it must  have been an earthquake, an occurrence which, although very rare in  that country, had taken place almost within the century; and then went  to bed again, strange to say, and fell fast asleep without once  thinking of Curdie, or associating the noises they had heard with what  he had told them.
  He had not believed Curdie.
  If he had, he would at  once have thought of what he had said, and would have taken  precautions.
  As they heard nothing more, they concluded that Sir  Walter was right, and that the danger was over for perhaps another  hundred years.
  The fact, as discovered afterwards, was that the  goblins had, in working up a second sloping face of stone, arrived at a  huge block which lay under the cellars of the house, within the line of  the foundations.
    It was so round that when they succeeded, after hard work, in  dislodging it without blasting, it rolled thundering down the slope  with a bounding, jarring roll, which shook the foundations of the  house.
  The goblins were themselves dismayed at the noise, for they  knew, by careful spying and measuring, that they must now be very near,  if not under the king's house, and they feared giving an alarm.
  They,  therefore, remained quiet for a while, and when they began to work  again, they no doubt thought themselves very fortunate in coming upon a  vein of sand which filled a winding fissure in the rock on which the  house was built.
  By scooping this away they came out in the king's  wine cellar.
    No sooner did they find where they were, than they scurried back again,  like rats into their holes, and running at full speed to the goblin  palace, announced their success to the king and queen with shouts of  triumph.
    In a moment the goblin royal family and the whole goblin people were on  their way in hot haste to the king's house, each eager to have a share  in the glory of carrying off that same night the Princess Irene.
    The queen went stumping along in one shoe of stone and one of skin.
    This could not have been pleasant, and my readers may wonder that, with  such skilful workmen about her, she had not yet replaced the shoe  carried off by Curdie.
  As the king, however, had more than one ground  of objection to her stone shoes, he no doubt took advantage of the  discovery of her toes, and threatened to expose her deformity if she  had another made.
  I presume he insisted on her being content with skin  shoes, and allowed her to wear the remaining granite one on the present  occasion only because she was going out to war.
    They soon arrived in the king's wine cellar, and regardless of its huge  vessels, of which they did not know the use, proceeded at once, but as  quietly as they could, to force the door that led upwards.
            The Goblins in the King's House    When Curdie fell asleep he began at once to dream.
  He thought he was  ascending the Mountainside from the mouth of the mine, whistling and  singing 'Ring, dod, bang!' when he came upon a woman and child who had  lost their way; and from that point he went on dreaming everything that  had happened to him since he thus met the princess and Lootie; how he  had watched the goblins, how he had been taken by them, how he had been  rescued by the princess; everything, indeed, until he was wounded,  captured, and imprisoned by the men-at-arms.
  And now he thought he was  lying wide awake where they had laid him, when suddenly he heard a  great thundering sound.
    'The cobs are coming!' he said.
  'They didn't believe a word I told  them!  The cobs'll be carrying off the princess from under their stupid  noses!  But they shan't! that they shan't!'    He jumped up, as he thought, and began to dress, but, to his dismay,  found that he was still lying in bed.
    'Now then, I will!' he said.
  'Here goes!  I am up now!'    But yet again he found himself snug in bed.
  Twenty times he tried, and  twenty times he failed; for in fact he was not awake, only dreaming  that he was.
  At length in an agony of despair, fancying he heard the  goblins all over the house, he gave a great cry.
  Then there came, as  he thought, a hand upon the lock of his door.
  It opened, and, looking  up, he saw a lady with white hair, carrying a silver box in her hand,  enter the room.
  She came to his bed, he thought, stroked his head and  face with cool, soft hands, took the dressing from his leg, rubbed it  with something that smelt like roses, and then waved her hands over him  three times.
  At the last wave of her hands everything vanished, he  felt himself sinking into the profoundest slumber, and remembered  nothing more until he awoke in earnest.
    The setting moon was throwing a feeble light through the casement, and  the house was full of uproar.
  There was soft heavy multitudinous  stamping, a clashing and clanging of weapons, the voices of men and the  cries of women, mixed with a hideous bellowing, which sounded  victorious.
  The cobs were in the house! He sprang from his bed,  hurried on some of his clothes, not forgetting his shoes, which were  armed with nails; then spying an old hunting-knife, or short sword,  hanging on the wall, he caught it, and rushed down the stairs, guided  by the sounds of strife, which grew louder and louder.
    When he reached the ground floor he found the whole place swarming.
    All the goblins of the mountain seemed gathered there.
  He rushed  amongst them, shouting:      'One, two,    Hit and hew!    Three, four,    Blast and bore!'    and with every rhyme he came down a great stamp upon a foot, cutting at  the same time their faces--executing, indeed, a sword dance of the  wildest description.
  Away scattered the goblins in every  direction--into closets, up stairs, into chimneys, up on rafters, and  down to the cellars.
  Curdie went on stamping and slashing and singing,  but saw nothing of the people of the house until he came to the great  hall, in which, the moment he entered it, arose a great goblin shout.
  The last of the men-at-arms, the captain himself, was on the floor,  buried beneath a wallowing crowd of goblins.
  For, while each knight  was busy defending himself as well as he could, by stabs in the thick  bodies of the goblins, for he had soon found their heads all but  invulnerable, the queen had attacked his legs and feet with her  horrible granite shoe, and he was soon down; but the captain had got  his back to the wall and stood out longer.
  The goblins would have torn  them all to pieces, but the king had given orders to carry them away  alive, and over each of them, in twelve groups, was standing a knot of  goblins, while as many as could find room were sitting upon their  prostrate bodies.
    Curdie burst in dancing and gyrating and stamping and singing like a  small incarnate whirlwind.
      'Where 'tis all a hole, sir,    Never can be holes:    Why should their shoes have soles, sir,    When they've got no souls?      'But she upon her foot, sir,    Has a granite shoe:    The strongest leather boot, sir,    Six would soon be through.
'      The queen gave a howl of rage and dismay; and before she recovered her  presence of mind, Curdie, having begun with the group nearest him, had  eleven of the knights on their legs again.
    'Stamp on their feet!' he cried as each man rose, and in a few minutes  the hall was nearly empty, the goblins running from it as fast as they  could, howling and shrieking and limping, and cowering every now and  then as they ran to cuddle their wounded feet in their hard hands, or  to protect them from the frightful stamp-stamp of the armed men.
    And now Curdie approached the group which, in trusting in the queen and  her shoe, kept their guard over the prostrate captain.
  The king sat on  the captain's head, but the queen stood in front, like an infuriated  cat, with her perpendicular eyes gleaming green, and her hair standing  half up from her horrid head.
  Her heart was quaking, however, and she  kept moving about her skin-shod foot with nervous apprehension.
  When  Curdie was within a few paces, she rushed at him, made one tremendous  stamp at his opposing foot, which happily he withdrew in time, and  caught him round the waist, to dash him on the marble floor.
  But just  as she caught him, he came down with all the weight of his iron-shod  shoe upon her skin-shod foot, and with a hideous howl she dropped him,  squatted on the floor, and took her foot in both her hands.
  Meanwhile  the rest rushed on the king and the bodyguard, sent them flying, and  lifted the prostrate captain, who was all but pressed to death.
  It was  some moments before he recovered breath and consciousness.
    'Where's the princess?' cried Curdie, again and again.
    No one knew, and off they all rushed in search of her.
    Through every room in the house they went, but nowhere was she to be  found.
  Neither was one of the servants to be seen.
  But Curdie, who  had kept to the lower part of the house, which was now quiet enough,  began to hear a confused sound as of a distant hubbub, and set out to  find where it came from.
  The noise grew as his sharp ears guided him  to a stair and so to the wine cellar.
  It was full of goblins, whom the  butler was supplying with wine as fast as he could draw it.
    While the queen and her party had encountered the men-at-arms, Harelip  with another company had gone off to search the house.
 They captured  every one they met, and when they could find no more, they hurried away  to carry them safe to the caverns below.
  But when the butler, who was  amongst them, found that their path lay through the wine cellar, he  bethought himself of persuading them to taste the wine, and, as he had  hoped, they no sooner tasted than they wanted more.
  The routed  goblins, on their way below, joined them, and when Curdie entered they  were all, with outstretched hands, in which were vessels of every  description from sauce pan to silver cup, pressing around the butler,  who sat at the tap of a huge cask, filling and filling.
  Curdie cast  one glance around the place before commencing his attack, and saw in  the farthest corner a terrified group of the domestics unwatched, but  cowering without courage to attempt their escape.
  Amongst them was the  terror-stricken face of Lootie; but nowhere could he see the princess.
  Seized with the horrible conviction that Harelip had already carried  her off, he rushed amongst them, unable for wrath to sing any more, but  stamping and cutting with greater fury than ever.
    'Stamp on their feet; stamp on their feet!' he shouted, and in a moment  the goblins were disappearing through the hole in the floor like rats  and mice.
    They could not vanish so fast, however, but that many more goblin feet  had to go limping back over the underground ways of the mountain that  morning.
    Presently, however, they were reinforced from above by the king and his  party, with the redoubtable queen at their head.
  Finding Curdie again  busy amongst her unfortunate subjects, she rushed at him once more with  the rage of despair, and this time gave him a bad bruise on the foot.
  Then a regular stamping fight got up between them, Curdie, with the  point of his hunting-knife, keeping her from clasping her mighty arms  about him, as he watched his opportunity of getting once more a good  stamp at her skin-shod foot.
  But the queen was more wary as well as  more agile than hitherto.
    The rest meantime, finding their adversary thus matched for the moment,  paused in their headlong hurry, and turned to the shivering group of  women in the corner.
  As if determined to emulate his father and have a  sun-woman of some sort to share his future throne, Harelip rushed at  them, caught up Lootie, and sped with her to the hole.
  She gave a  great shriek, and Curdie heard her, and saw the plight she was in.
  Gathering all his strength, he gave the queen a sudden cut across the  face with his weapon, came down, as she started back, with all his  weight on the proper foot, and sprung to Lootie's rescue.
  The prince  had two defenceless feet, and on both of them Curdie stamped just as he  reached the hole.
  He dropped his burden and rolled shrieking into the  earth.
  Curdie made one stab at him as he disappeared, caught hold of  the senseless Lootie, and having dragged her back to the corner, there  mounted guard over her, preparing once more to encounter the queen.
    Her face streaming with blood, and her eyes flashing green lightning  through it, she came on with her mouth open and her teeth grinning like  a tiger's, followed by the king and her bodyguard of the thickest  goblins.
  But the same moment in rushed the captain and his men, and  ran at them stamping furiously.
  They dared not encounter such an  onset.
  Away they scurried, the queen foremost.
 Of course, the right  thing would have been to take the king and queen prisoners, and hold  them hostages for the princess, but they were so anxious to find her  that no one thought of detaining them until it was too late.
    Having thus rescued the servants, they set about searching the house  once more.
  None of them could give the least information concerning  the princess.
  Lootie was almost silly with terror, and, although  scarcely able to walk would not leave Curdie's side for a single  moment.
  Again he allowed the others to search the rest of the  house--where, except a dismayed goblin lurking here and there, they  found no one--while he requested Lootie to take him to the princess's  room.
  She was as submissive and obedient as if he had been the king.
    He found the bedclothes tossed about, and most of them on the floor,  while the princess's garments were scattered all over the room, which  was in the greatest confusion.
  It was only too evident that the  goblins had been there, and Curdie had no longer any doubt that she had  been carried off at the very first of the inroad.
 With a pang of  despair he saw how wrong they had been in not securing the king and  queen and prince; but he determined to find and rescue the princess as  she had found and rescued him, or meet the worst fate to which the  goblins could doom him.
            Curdie's Guide    Just as the consolation of this resolve dawned upon his mind and he was  turning away for the cellar to follow the goblins into their hole,  something touched his hand.
  It was the slightest touch, and when he  looked he could see nothing.
  Feeling and peering about in the grey of  the dawn, his fingers came upon a tight thread.
  He looked again, and  narrowly, but still could see nothing.
  It flashed upon him that this  must be the princess's thread.
  Without saying a word, for he knew no  one would believe him any more than he had believed the princess, he  followed the thread with his finger, contrived to give Lootie the slip,  and was soon out of the house and on the mountainside--surprised that,  if the thread were indeed the grandmother's messenger, it should have  led the princess, as he supposed it must, into the mountain, where she  would be certain to meet the goblins rushing back enraged from their  defeat.
  But he hurried on in the hope of overtaking her first.
  When  he arrived, however, at the place where the path turned off for the  mine, he found that the thread did not turn with it, but went straight  up the mountain.
  Could it be that the thread was leading him home to  his mother's cottage?  Could the princess be there?  He bounded up the  mountain like one of its own goats, and before the sun was up the  thread had brought him indeed to his mother's door.
  There it vanished  from his fingers, and he could not find it, search as he might.
    The door was on the latch, and he entered.
  There sat his mother by the  fire, and in her arms lay the princess, fast asleep.
    'Hush, Curdie!' said his mother.
  'Do not wake her.
  I'm so glad you're  come!  I thought the cobs must have got you again!'    With a heart full of delight, Curdie sat down at a corner of the  hearth, on a stool opposite his mother's chair, and gazed at the  princess, who slept as peacefully as if she had been in her own bed.
  All at once she opened her eyes and fixed them on him.
    'Oh, Curdie! you're come!' she said quietly.
  'I thought you would!'    Curdie rose and stood before her with downcast eyes.
    'Irene,' he said, 'I am very sorry I did not believe you.
'    'Oh, never mind, Curdie!' answered the princess.
  'You couldn't, you  know.
  You do believe me now, don't you?'    'I can't help it now.
  I ought to have helped it before.
'    'Why can't you help it now?'    'Because, just as I was going into the mountain to look for you, I got  hold of your thread, and it brought me here.
'    'Then you've come from my house, have you?'    'Yes, I have.
'    'I didn't know you were there.
'    'I've been there two or three days, I believe.
'    'And I never knew it!  Then perhaps you can tell me why my grandmother  has brought me here?  I can't think.
  Something woke me--I didn't know  what, but I was frightened, and I felt for the thread, and there it  was!  I was more frightened still when it brought me out on the  mountain, for I thought it was going to take me into it again, and I  like the outside of it best.
  I supposed you were in trouble again, and  I had to get you out.
  But it brought me here instead; and, oh, Curdie!  your mother has been so kind to me--just like my own grandmother!'    Here Curdie's mother gave the princess a hug, and the princess turned  and gave her a sweet smile, and held up her mouth to kiss her.
    'Then you didn't see the cobs?'asked Curdie.
    'No; I haven't been into the mountain, I told you, Curdie.
'    'But the cobs have been into your house--all over it--and into your  bedroom, making such a row!'    'What did they want there?  It was very rude of them.
'    'They wanted you--to carry you off into the mountain with them, for a  wife to their prince Harelip.
'    'Oh, how dreadful' cried the princess, shuddering.
    'But you needn't be afraid, you know.
  Your grandmother takes care of  you.
'    'Ah! you do believe in my grandmother, then?  I'm so glad!  She made me  think you would some day.
'    All at once Curdie remembered his dream, and was silent, thinking.
    'But how did you come to be in my house, and me not know it?' asked the  princess.
    Then Curdie had to explain everything--how he had watched for her sake,  how he had been wounded and shut up by the soldiers, how he heard the  noises and could not rise, and how the beautiful old lady had come to  him, and all that followed.
    'Poor Curdie! to lie there hurt and ill, and me never to know it!'  exclaimed the princess, stroking his rough hand.
  'I would have come  and nursed you, if they had told me.
'    'I didn't see you were lame,' said his mother.
    'Am I, mother?  Oh--yes--I suppose I ought to be! I declare I've never  thought of it since I got up to go down amongst the cobs!'    'Let me see the wound,' said his mother.
    He pulled down his stocking--when behold, except a great scar, his leg  was perfectly sound!    Curdie and his mother gazed in each other's eyes, full of wonder, but  Irene called out:    'I thought so, Curdie!  I was sure it wasn't a dream.
  I was sure my  grandmother had been to see you.
  Don't you smell the roses?  It was my  grandmother healed your leg, and sent you to help me.
'    'No, Princess Irene,' said Curdie; 'I wasn't good enough to be allowed  to help you: I didn't believe you.
  Your grandmother took care of you  without me.
'    'She sent you to help my people, anyhow.
  I wish my king-papa would  come.
  I do want so to tell him how good you have been!'    'But,' said the mother, 'we are forgetting how frightened your people  must be.
  You must take the princess home at once, Curdie--or at least  go and tell them where she is.
'    'Yes, mother.
  Only I'm dreadfully hungry.
  Do let me have some  breakfast first.
  They ought to have listened to me, and then they  wouldn't have been taken by surprise as they were.
'    'That is true, Curdie; but it is not for you to blame them much.
 You  remember?'    'Yes, mother, I do.
  Only I must really have something to eat.
'    'You shall, my boy--as fast as I can get it,' said his mother, rising  and setting the princess on her chair.
    But before his breakfast was ready, Curdie jumped up so suddenly as to  startle both his companions.
    'Mother, mother!' he cried, 'I was forgetting.
  You must take the  princess home yourself.
  I must go and wake my father.
'    Without a word of explanation, he rushed to the place where his father  was sleeping.
  Having thoroughly roused him with what he told him he  darted out of the cottage.
            Masonwork    He had all at once remembered the resolution of the goblins to carry  out their second plan upon the failure of the first.
  No doubt they  were already busy, and the mine was therefore in the greatest danger of  being flooded and rendered useless--not to speak of the lives of the  miners.
    When he reached the mouth of the mine, after rousing all the miners  within reach, he found his father and a good many more just entering.
  They all hurried to the gang by which he had found a way into the  goblin country.
  There the foresight of Peter had already collected a  great many blocks of stone, with cement, ready for building up the weak  place--well enough known to the goblins.
 Although there was not room  for more than two to be actually building at once, they managed, by  setting all the rest to work in preparing the cement and passing the  stones, to finish in the course of the day a huge buttress filling the  whole gang, and supported everywhere by the live rock.
  Before the hour  when they usually dropped work, they were satisfied the mine was secure.
    They had heard goblin hammers and pickaxes busy all the time, and at  length fancied they heard sounds of water they had never heard before.
  But that was otherwise accounted for when they left the mine, for they  stepped out into a tremendous storm which was raging all over the  mountain.
  The thunder was bellowing, and the lightning lancing out of  a huge black cloud which lay above it and hung down  its edges of thick  mist over its sides.
  The lightning was breaking out of the mountain,  too, and flashing up into the cloud.
  From the state of the brooks, now  swollen into raging torrents, it was evident that the storm had been  storming all day.
    The wind was blowing as if it would blow him off the mountain, but,  anxious about his mother and the princess, Curdie darted up through the  thick of the tempest.
  Even if they had not set out before the storm  came on, he did not judge them safe, for in such a storm even their  poor little house was in danger.
  Indeed he soon found that but for a  huge rock against which it was built, and which protected it both from  the blasts and the waters, it must have been swept if it was not blown  away; for the two torrents into which this rock parted the rush of  water behind it united again in front of the cottage--two roaring and  dangerous streams, which his mother and the princess could not possibly  have passed.
  It was with great difficulty that he forced his way  through one of them, and up to the door.
    The moment his hand fell on the latch, through all the uproar of winds  and Waters came the joyous cry of the princess:    'There's Curdie!  Curdie!  Curdie!'    She was sitting wrapped in blankets on the bed, his mother trying for  the hundredth time to light the fire which had been drowned by the rain  that came down the chimney.
  The clay floor was one mass of mud, and  the whole place looked wretched.
  But the faces of the mother and the  princess shone as if their troubles only made them the merrier.
  Curdie  burst out laughing at the sight of them.
    'I never had such fun!' said the princess, her eyes twinkling and her  pretty teeth shining.
  'How nice it must be to live in a cottage on the  mountain!'    'It all depends on what kind your inside house is,' said the mother.
    'I know what you mean,' said Irene.
  'That's the kind of thing my  grandmother says.
'    By the time Peter returned the storm was nearly over, but the streams  were so fierce and so swollen that it was not only out of the question  for the princess to go down the mountain, but most dangerous for Peter  even or Curdie to make the attempt in the gathering darkness.
    'They will be dreadfully frightened about you,' said Peter to the  princess, 'but we cannot help it.
  We must wait till the morning.
'    With Curdie's help, the fire was lighted at last, and the mother set  about making their supper; and after supper they all told the princess  stories till she grew sleepy.
  Then Curdie's mother laid her in  Curdie's bed, which was in a tiny little garret-room.
  As soon as she  was in bed, through a little window low down in the roof she caught  sight of her grandmother's lamp shining far away beneath, and she gazed  at the beautiful silvery globe until she fell asleep.
            The King and the Kiss    The next morning the sun rose so bright that Irene said the rain had  washed his face and let the light out clean.
  The torrents were still  roaring down the side of the mountain, but they were so much smaller as  not to be dangerous in the daylight.
  After an early breakfast, Peter  went to his work and Curdie and his mother set out to take the princess  home.
  They had difficulty in getting her dry across the streams, and  Curdie had again and again to carry her, but at last they got safe on  the broader part of the road, and walked gently down towards the king's  house.
  And what should they see as they turned the last corner but the  last of the king's troop riding through the gate!    'Oh, Curdie!' cried Irene, clapping her hands right joyfully,'my  king-papa is come.
'    The moment Curdie heard that, he caught her up in his arms, and set off  at full speed, crying:    'Come on, mother dear!  The king may break his heart before he knows  that she is safe.
'    Irene clung round his neck and he ran with her like a deer.
  When he  entered the gate into the court, there sat the king on his horse, with  all the people of the house about him, weeping and hanging their heads.
  The king was not weeping, but his face was white as a dead man's, and  he looked as if the life had gone out of him.
  The men-at-arms he had  brought with him sat with horror-stricken faces, but eyes flashing with  rage, waiting only for the word of the king to do something--they did  not know what, and nobody knew what.
    The day before, the men-at-arms belonging to the house, as soon as they  were satisfied the princess had been carried away, rushed after the  goblins into the hole, but found that they had already so skilfully  blockaded the narrowest part, not many feet below the cellar, that  without miners and their tools they could do nothing.
 Not one of them  knew where the mouth of the mine lay, and some of those who had set out  to find it had been overtaken by the storm and had not even yet  returned.
  Poor Sir Walter was especially filled with shame, and almost  hoped the king would order his head to be cut off, for to think of that  sweet little face down amongst the goblins was unendurable.
    When Curdie ran in at the gate with the princess in his arms, they were  all so absorbed in their own misery and awed by the king's presence and  grief, that no one observed his arrival.
  He went straight up to the  king, where he sat on his horse.
    'Papa! papa!' the princess cried, stretching out her arms to him; 'here  I am!'    The king started.
  The colour rushed to his face.
  He gave an  inarticulate cry.
  Curdie held up the princess, and the king bent down  and took her from his arms.
  As he clasped her to his bosom, the big  tears went dropping down his cheeks and his beard.
  And such a shout  arose from all the bystanders that the startled horses pranced and  capered, and the armour rang and clattered, and the rocks of the  mountain echoed back the noises.
  The princess greeted them all as she  nestled in her father's bosom, and the king did not set her down until  she had told them all the story.
  But she had more to tell about Curdie  than about herself, and what she did tell about herself none of them  could understand--except the king and Curdie, who stood by the king's  knee stroking the neck of the great white horse.
  And still as she told  what Curdie had done, Sir Walter and others added to what she told,  even Lootie joining in the praises of his courage and energy.
    Curdie held his peace, looking quietly up in the king's face.
  And his  mother stood on the outskirts of the crowd listening with delight, for  her son's deeds were pleasant in her ears, until the princess caught  sight of her.
    'And there is his mother, king-papa!' she said.
  'See--there.
  She is  such a nice mother, and has been so kind to me!'    They all parted asunder as the king made a sign to her to come forward.
  She obeyed, and he gave her his hand, but could not speak.
    'And now, king-papa,' the princess went on, 'I must tell you another  thing.
  One night long ago Curdie drove the goblins away and brought  Lootie and me safe from the mountain.
  And I promised him a kiss when  we got home, but Lootie wouldn't let me give it him.
  I don't want you  to scold Lootie, but I want you to tell her that a princess must do as  she promises.
'    'Indeed she must, my child--except it be wrong,' said the king.
 'There,  give Curdie a kiss.
'    And as he spoke he held her towards him.
    The princess reached down, threw her arms round Curdie's neck, and  kissed him on the mouth, saying: 'There, Curdie!  There's the kiss I  promised you!'    Then they all went into the house, and the cook rushed to the kitchen  and the servants to their work.
  Lootie dressed Irene in her shiningest  clothes, and the king put off his armour, and put on purple and gold;  and a messenger was sent for Peter and all the miners, and there was a  great and a grand feast, which continued long after the princess was  put to bed.
            The Subterranean Waters    The king's harper, who always formed a part of his escort, was chanting  a ballad which he made as he went on playing on his instrument--about  the princess and the goblins, and the prowess of Curdie, when all at  once he ceased, with his eyes on one of the doors of the hall.
  Thereupon the eyes of the king and his guests turned thitherward also.
  The next moment, through the open doorway came the princess Irene.
  She  went straight up to her father, with her right hand stretched out a  little sideways, and her forefinger, as her father and Curdie  understood, feeling its way along the invisible thread.
  The king took  her on his knee, and she said in his ear:    'King-papa, do you hear that noise?'    'I hear nothing,' said the king.
    'Listen,' she said, holding up her forefinger.
    The king listened, and a great stillness fell upon the company.
 Each  man, seeing that the king listened, listened also, and the harper sat  with his harp between his arms, and his finger silent upon the strings.
    'I do hear a noise,' said the king at length--'a noise as of distant  thunder.
  It is coming nearer and nearer.
  What can it be?'    They all heard it now, and each seemed ready to start to his feet as he  listened.
  Yet all sat perfectly still.
  The noise came rapidly nearer.
    'What can it be?' said the king again.
    'I think it must be another storm coming over the mountain,' said Sir  Walter.
    Then Curdie, who at the first word of the king had slipped from his  seat, and laid his ear to the ground, rose up quickly, and approaching  the king said, speaking very fast:    'Please, Your Majesty, I think I know what it is.
  I have no time to  explain, for that might make it too late for some of us.
  Will Your  Majesty give orders that everybody leave the house as quickly as  possible and get up the mountain?'    The king, who was the wisest man in the kingdom, knew well there was a  time when things must be done and questions left till afterwards.
  He  had faith in Curdie, and rose instantly, with Irene in his arms.
  'Every man and woman follow me,' he said, and strode out into the  darkness.
    Before he had reached the gate, the noise had grown to a great  thundering roar, and the ground trembled beneath their feet, and before  the last of them had crossed the court, out after them from the great  hall door came a huge rush of turbid water, and almost swept them away.
  But they got safe out of the gate and up the mountain, while the  torrent went roaring down the road into the valley beneath.
    Curdie had left the king and the princess to look after his mother,  whom he and his father, one on each side, caught up when the stream  overtook them and carried safe and dry.
    When the king had got out of the way of the water, a little up the  mountain, he stood with the princess in his arms, looking back with  amazement on the issuing torrent, which glimmered fierce and foamy  through the night.
  There Curdie rejoined them.
    'Now, Curdie,' said the king, 'what does it mean?  Is this what you  expected?'    'It is, Your Majesty,' said Curdie; and proceeded to tell him about the  second scheme of the goblins, who, fancying the miners of more  importance to the upper world than they were, had resolved, if they  should fail in carrying off the king's daughter, to flood the mine and  drown the miners.
  Then he explained what the miners had done to  prevent it.
  The goblins had, in pursuance of their design, let loose  all the underground reservoirs and streams, expecting the water to run  down into the mine, which was lower than their part of the mountain,  for they had, as they supposed, not knowing of the solid wall close  behind, broken a passage through into it.
  But the readiest outlet the  water could find had turned out to be the tunnel they had made to the  king's house, the possibility of which catastrophe had not occurred to  the young miner until he had laid his ear to the floor of the hall.
    What was then to be done?  The house appeared in danger of falling, and  every moment the torrent was increasing.
    'We must set out at once,' said the king.
  'But how to get at the  horses!'    'Shall I see if we can manage that?' said Curdie.
    'Do,' said the king.
    Curdie gathered the men-at-arms, and took them over the garden wall,  and so to the stables.
  They found their horses in terror; the water  was rising fast around them, and it was quite time they were got out.
  But there was no way to get them out, except by riding them through the  stream, which was now pouring from the lower windows as well as the  door.
  As one horse was quite enough for any man to manage through such  a torrent, Curdie got on the king's white charger and, leading the way,  brought them all in safety to the rising ground.
    'Look, look, Curdie!' cried Irene, the moment that, having dismounted,  he led the horse up to the king.
    Curdie did look, and saw, high in the air, somewhere about the top of  the king's house, a great globe of light shining like the purest silver.
    'Oh!' he cried in some consternation, 'that is your grandmother's lamp!  We must get her out.
  I will go an find her.
  The house may fall, you  know.
'    'My grandmother is in no danger,' said Irene, smiling.
    'Here, Curdie, take the princess while I get on my horse,' said the  king.
    Curdie took the princess again, and both turned their eyes to the globe  of light.
  The same moment there shot from it a white bird, which,  descending with outstretched wings, made one circle round the king an  Curdie and the princess, and then glided up again.
  The light and the  pigeon vanished together.
    'Now, Curdie!' said the princess, as he lifted her to her father's  arms, 'you see my grandmother knows all about it, and isn't frightened.
  I believe she could walk through that water and it wouldn't wet her a  bit.
'    'But, my child,' said the king, 'you will be cold if you haven't  Something more on.
  Run, Curdie, my boy, and fetch anything you can lay  your hands on, to keep the princess warm.
  We have a long ride before  us.
'    Curdie was gone in a moment, and soon returned with a great rich fur,  and the news that dead goblins were tossing about in the current  through the house.
  They had been caught in their own snare; instead of  the mine they had flooded their own country, whence they were now swept  up drowned.
  Irene shuddered, but the king held her close to his bosom.
  Then he turned to Sir Walter, and said:    'Bring Curdie's father and mother here.
'    'I wish,' said the king, when they stood before him, 'to take your son  with me.
  He shall enter my bodyguard at once, and wait further  promotion.
'    Peter and his wife, overcome, only murmured almost inaudible thanks.
  But Curdie spoke aloud.
    'Please, Your Majesty,' he said, 'I cannot leave my father and mother.
'    'That's right, Curdie!' cried the princess.
  'I wouldn't if I was you.
'    The king looked at the princess and then at Curdie with a glow of  satisfaction on his countenance.
    'I too think you are right, Curdie,' he said, 'and I will not ask you  again.
  But I shall have a chance of doing something for you some time.
'    'Your Majesty has already allowed me to serve you,' said Curdie.
    'But, Curdie,' said his mother, 'why shouldn't you go with the king?  We can get on very well without you.
'    'But I can't get on very well without you,' said Curdie.
  'The king is  very kind, but I could not be half the use to him that I am to you.
  Please, Your Majesty, if you wouldn't mind giving my mother a red  petticoat!  I should have got her one long ago, but for the goblins.
'    'As soon as we get home,' said the king, 'Irene and I will search out  the warmest one to be found, and send it by one of the gentlemen.
'    'Yes, that we will, Curdie!' said the princess.
  'And next summer we'll  come back and see you wear it, Curdie's mother,' she added.
 'Shan't we,  king-papa?'    'Yes, my love; I hope so,' said the king.
    Then turning to the miners, he said:    'Will you do the best you can for my servants tonight?  I hope they  will be able to return to the house tomorrow.
'    The miners with one voice promised their hospitality.
 Then the king  commanded his servants to mind whatever Curdie should say to them, and  after shaking hands with him and his father and mother, the king and  the princess and all their company rode away down the side of the new  stream, which had already devoured half the road, into the starry night.
            The Last Chapter    All the rest went up the mountain, and separated in groups to the homes  of the miners.
  Curdie and his father and mother took Lootie with them.
  And the whole way a light, of which all but Lootie understood the  origin, shone upon their path.
  But when they looked round they could  see nothing of the silvery globe.
    For days and days the water continued to rush from the doors and  windows of the king's house, and a few goblin bodies were swept out  into the road.
    Curdie saw that something must be done.
  He spoke to his father and the  rest of the miners, and they at once proceeded to make another outlet  for the waters.
  By setting all hands to the work, tunnelling here and  building there, they soon succeeded; and having also made a little  tunnel to drain the water away from under the king's house, they were  soon able to get into the wine cellar, where they found a multitude of  dead goblins--among the rest the queen, with the skin-shoe gone, and  the stone one fast to her ankle--for the water had swept away the  barricade, which prevented the men-at-arms from following the goblins,  and had greatly widened the passage.
  They built it securely up, and  then went back to their labours in the mine.
    A good many of the goblins with their creatures escaped from the  inundation out upon the mountain.
  But most of them soon left that part  of the country, and most of those who remained grew milder in  character, and indeed became very much like the Scotch brownies.
 Their  skulls became softer as well as their hearts, and their feet grew  harder, and by degrees they became friendly with the inhabitants of the  mountain and even with the miners.
  But the latter were merciless to  any of the cobs' creatures that came in their way, until at length they  all but disappeared.
    The rest of the history of The Princess and Curdie must be kept for  another volume.
                    .
         Produced by Michael Leonard                  The Mansion    By    Henry van Dyke        There was an air of calm and reserved opulence about the Weightman  mansion that spoke not of money squandered, but of wealth prudently  applied.
  Standing on a corner of the Avenue no longer fashionable for  residence, it looked upon the swelling tide of business with an  expression of complacency and half-disdain.
    The house was not beautiful.
  There was nothing in its straight front  of chocolate-colored stone, its heavy cornices, its broad, staring  windows of plate glass, its carved and bronze-bedecked mahogany doors  at the top of the wide stoop, to charm the eye or fascinate the  imagination.
  But it was eminently respectable, and in its way  imposing.
  It seemed to say that the glittering shops of the jewelers,  the milliners, the confectioners, the florists, the picture-dealers,  the furriers, the makers of rare and costly antiquities, retail traders  in luxuries of life, were beneath the notice of a house that had its  foundations in the high finance, and was built literally and  figuratively in the shadow of St.
 Petronius' Church.
    At the same time there was something self-pleased and congratulatory in  the way in which the mansion held its own amid the changing  neighborhood.
  It almost seemed to be lifted up a little, among the  tall buildings near at hand, as if it felt the rising value of the land  on which it stood.
    John Weightman was like the house into which he had built himself  thirty years ago, and in which his ideals and ambitions were incrusted.
  He was a self-made man.
  But in making himself he had chosen a highly  esteemed pattern and worked according to the approved rules.
  There was  nothing irregular, questionable, flamboyant about him.
    He was solid, correct, and justly successful.
    His minor tastes, of course, had been carefully kept up to date.
    At the proper time, pictures of the Barbizon masters, old English plate  and portraits, bronzes by Barye and marbles by Rodin, Persian carpets  and Chinese porcelains, had been introduced to the mansion.
  It  contained a Louis Quinze reception-room, an Empire drawing-room, a  Jacobean dining-room, and various apartments dimly reminiscent of the  styles of furniture affected by deceased monarchs.
  That the hallways  were too short for the historic perspective did not make much  difference.
  American decorative art is capable de tout, it absorbs all  periods.
  Of each period Mr. Weightman wished to have something of the  best.
  He understood its value, present as a certificate, and  prospective as an investment.
    It was only in the architecture of his town house that he remained  conservative, immovable, one might almost say  Early-Victorian-Christian.
  His country house at Dulwich-on-the-Sound  was a palace of the Italian Renaissance.
  But in town he adhered to an  architecture which had moral associations, the  Nineteenth-Century-Brownstone epoch.
  It was a symbol of his social  position, his religious doctrine, and even, in a way, of his business  creed.
    "A man of fixed principles," he would say, "should express them in the  looks of his house.
  New York changes its domestic architecture too  rapidly.
  It is like divorce.
  It is not dignified.
  I don't like it.
  Extravagance and fickleness are advertised in most of these new houses.
  I wish to be known for different qualities.
  Dignity and prudence are  the things that people trust.
  Every one knows that I can afford to  live in the house that suits me.
  It is a guarantee to the public.
  It  inspires confidence.
  It helps my influence.
  There is a text in the  Bible about 'a house that hath foundations.
' That is the proper kind of  a mansion for a solid man.
"    Harold Weightman had often listened to his father discoursing in this  fashion on the fundamental principles of life, and always with a  divided mind.
  He admired immensely his father's talents and the  single-minded energy with which he improved them.
  But in the paternal  philosophy there was something that disquieted and oppressed the young  man, and made him gasp inwardly for fresh air and free action.
    At times, during his college course and his years at the law school, he  had yielded to this impulse and broken away--now toward extravagance  and dissipation, and then, when the reaction came, toward a romantic  devotion to work among the poor.
  He had felt his father's disapproval  for both of these forms of imprudence; but is was never expressed in a  harsh or violent way, always with a certain tolerant patience, such as  one might show for the mistakes and vagaries of the very young.
  John  Weightman was not hasty, impulsive, inconsiderate, even toward his own  children.
  With them, as with the rest of the world, he felt that he  had a reputation to maintain, a theory to vindicate.
  He could afford  to give them time to see that he was absolutely right.
    One of his favorite Scripture quotations was, "Wait on the Lord.
"    He had applied it to real estate and to people, with profitable results.
    But to human persons the sensation of being waited for is not always  agreeable.
  Sometimes, especially with the young, it produces a vague  restlessness, a dumb resentment, which is increased by the fact that  one can hardly explain or justify it.
  Of this John Weightman was not  conscious.
  It lay beyond his horizon.
  He did not take it into account  in the plan of life which he made for himself and for his family as the  sharers and inheritors of his success.
    "Father plays us," said Harold, in a moment of irritation, to his  mother, "like pieces in a game of chess.
    "My dear," said that lady, whose faith in her husband was religious,  "you ought not to speak so impatiently.
  At least he wins the game.
  He  is one of the most respected men in New York.
  And he is very generous,  too.
"    "I wish he would be more generous in letting us be ourselves," said the  young man.
  "He always has something in view for us and expects to move  us up to it.
"    "But isn't it always for our benefit?" replied his mother.
  "Look what  a position we have.
  No one can say there is any taint on our money.
  There are no rumors about your father.
  He has kept the laws of God and  of man.
  He has never made any mistakes.
" Harold got up from his chair  and poked the fire.
  Then he came back to the ample, well-gowned,  firm-looking lady, and sat beside her on the sofa.
  He took her hand  gently and looked at the two rings--a thin band of yellow gold, and a  small solitaire diamond--which kept their place on her third finger in  modest dignity, as if not shamed, but rather justified, by the splendor  of the emerald which glittered beside them.
    "Mother," he said, "you have a wonderful hand.
  And father made no  mistake when he won you.
  But are you sure he has always been so  inerrant?"    "Harold," she exclaimed, a little stiffly, "what do you mean?  His life  is an open book.
"    "Oh," he answered, "I don't mean anything bad, mother dear.
  I know the  governor's life is an open book--a ledger, if you like, kept in the  best bookkeeping hand, and always ready for inspection--every page  correct, and showing a handsome balance.
  But isn't it a mistake not to  allow us to make our own mistakes, to learn for ourselves, to live our  own lives?  Must we be always working for 'the balance,' in one thing  or another?  I want to be myself--to get outside of this everlasting,  profitable 'plan'--to let myself go, and lose myself for a while at  least--to do the things that I want to do, just because I want to do  them.
"    "My boy," said his mother, anxiously, "you are not going to do anything  wrong or foolish?  You know the falsehood of that old proverb about  wild oats.
"    He threw back his head and laughed.
  "Yes, mother," he answered, "I  know it well enough.
  But in California, you know, the wild oats are  one of the most valuable crops.
  They grow all over the hillsides and  keep the cattle and the horses alive.
  But that wasn't what I meant--to  sow wild oats.
  Say to pick wild flowers, if you like, or even to chase  wild geese--to do something that seems good to me just for its own  sake, not for the sake of wages of one kind or another.
  I feel like a  hired man, in the service of this magnificent mansion--say in training  for father's place as majordomo.
  I'd like to get out some way, to feel  free--perhaps to do something for others.
"    The young man's voice hesitated a little.
  "Yes, it sounds like cant, I  know, but sometimes I feel as if I'd like to do some good in the world,  if father only wouldn't insist upon God's putting it into the ledger.
"    His mother moved uneasily, and a slight look of bewilderment came into  her face.
    "Isn't that almost irreverent?" she asked.
  "Surely the righteous must  have their reward.
  And your father is good.
  See how much he gives to  all the established charities, how many things he has founded.
  He's  always thinking of others, and planning for them.
  And surely, for us,  he does everything.
  How well he has planned this trip to Europe for me  and the girls--the court-presentation at Berlin, the season on the  Riviera, the visits in England with the Plumptons and the Halverstones.
  He says Lord Halverstone has the finest old house in Sussex, pure  Elizabethan, and all the old customs are kept up, too--family prayers  every morning for all the domestics.
  By-the-way, you know his son  Bertie, I believe.
"    Harold smiled a little to himself as he answered: "Yes, I fished at  Catalina Island last June with the Honorable Ethelbert; he's rather a  decent chap, in spite of his ingrowing mind.
  But you?--mother, you are  simply magnificent!  You are father's masterpiece.
"  The young man  leaned over to kiss her, and went up to the Riding Club for his  afternoon canter in the Park.
    So it came to pass, early in December, that Mrs. Weightman and her two  daughters sailed for Europe, on their serious pleasure trip, even as it  had been written in the book of Providence; and John Weightman, who had  made the entry, was left to pass the rest of the winter with his son  and heir in the brownstone mansion.
    They were comfortable enough.
  The machinery of the massive  establishment ran as smoothly as a great electric dynamo.
  They were  busy enough, too.
  John Weightman's plans and enterprises were  complicated, though his principle of action was always simple--to get  good value for every expenditure and effort.
  The banking-house of  which he was the chief, the brain, the will, the absolutely controlling  hand, was so admirably organized that the details of its direction took  but little time.
    But the scores of other interests that radiated from it and were  dependent upon it--or perhaps it would be more accurate to say, that  contributed to its solidity and success--the many investments,  industrial, political, benevolent, reformatory, ecclesiastical, that  had made the name of Weightman well known and potent in city, church,  and state, demanded much attention and careful steering, in order that  each might produce the desired result.
  There were board meetings of  corporations and hospitals, conferences in Wall Street and at Albany,  consultations and committee meetings in the brownstone mansion.
    For a share in all this business and its adjuncts John Weightman had  his son in training in one of the famous law firms of the city; for he  held that banking itself is a simple affair, the only real difficulties  of finance are on its legal side.
  Meantime he wished the young man to  meet and know the men with whom he would have to deal when he became a  partner in the house.
  So a couple of dinners were given in the mansion  during December, after which the father called the son's attention to  the fact that over a hundred million dollars had sat around the board.
    But on Christmas Eve father and son were dining together without  guests, and their talk across the broad table, glittering with silver  and cut glass, and softly lit by shaded candles, was intimate, though a  little slow at times.
  The elder man was in rather a rare mood, more  expansive and confidential than usual; and, when the coffee was brought  in and they were left alone, he talked more freely of his personal  plans and hopes than he had ever done before.
    "I feel very grateful to-night," said he, at last; "it must be  something in the air of Christmas that gives me this feeling of  thankfulness for the many divine mercies that have been bestowed upon  me.
  All the principles by which I have tried to guide my life have  been justified.
  I have never made the value of this salted almond by  anything that the courts would not uphold, at least in the long run,  and yet--or wouldn't it be truer to say and therefore?--my affairs have  been wonderfully prospered.
  There's a great deal in that text 'Honesty  is the best'--but no, that's not from the Bible, after all, is it?  Wait a moment; there is something of that kind, I know.
"    "May I light a cigar, father," said Harold, turning away to hide a  smile, "while you are remembering the text?"    "Yes, certainly," answered the elder man, rather shortly; "you know I  don't dislike the smell.
  But it is a wasteful, useless habit, and  therefore I have never practised it.
  Nothing useless is worth while,  that's my motto--nothing that does not bring the reward.
  Oh, now I  recall the text, 'Verily I say unto you they have their reward.
' I  shall ask Doctor Snodgrass to preach a sermon on that verse some day.
"    "Using you as an illustration?"    "Well, not exactly that; but I could give him some good materials from  my own experience to prove the truth of Scripture.
  I can honestly say  that there is not one of my charities that has not brought me in a good  return, either in the increase of influence, the building up of credit,  or the association with substantial people.
  Of course you have to be  careful how you give, in order to secure the best results--no  indiscriminate giving--no pennies in beggars' hats!  It has been one of  my principles always to use the same kind of judgment in charities that  I use in my other affairs, and they have not disappointed me.
"    "Even the check that you put in the plate when you take the offertory  up the aisle on Sunday morning?"    "Certainly; though there the influence is less direct; and I must  confess that I have my doubts in regard to the collection for Foreign  Missions.
  That always seems to me romantic and wasteful.
  You never  hear from it in any definite way.
  They say the missionaries have done  a good deal to open the way for trade; perhaps--but they have also  gotten us into commercial and political difficulties.
  Yet I give to  them--a little--it is a matter of conscience with me to identify myself  with all the enterprises of the Church; it is the mainstay of social  order and a prosperous civilization.
  But the best forms of benevolence  are the well-established, organized ones here at home, where people can  see them and know what they are doing.
"    "You mean the ones that have a local habitation and a name.
"    "Yes; they offer by far the safest return, though of course there is  something gained by contributing to general funds.
  A public man can't  afford to be without public spirit.
  But on the whole I prefer a  building, or an endowment.
  There is a mutual advantage to a good name  and a good institution in their connection in the public mind.
  It  helps them both.
  Remember that, my boy.
  Of course at the beginning  you will have to practise it in a small way; later, you will have  larger opportunities.
  But try to put your gifts where they can be  identified and do good all around.
  You'll see the wisdom of it in the  long run.
"    "I can see it already, sir, and the way you describe it looks amazingly  wise and prudent.
  In other words, we must cast our bread on the waters  in large loaves, carried by sound ships marked with the owner's name,  so that the return freight will be sure to come back to us.
"    The father laughed, but his eyes were frowning a little as if he  suspected something irreverent under the respectful reply.
  "You put it  humorously, but there's sense in what you say.
  Why not?  God rules the  sea; but He expects us to follow the laws of navigation and commerce.
  Why not take good care of your bread, even when you give it away?"    "It's not for me to say why not--and yet I can think of cases--"    The young man hesitated for a moment.
  His half-finished cigar had gone  out.
  He rose and tossed it into the fire, in front of which he  remained standing--a slender, eager, restless young figure, with a  touch of hunger in the fine face, strangely like and unlike the father,  at whom he looked with half-wistful curiosity.
    "The fact is, sir," he continued, "there is such a case in my mind now,  and it is a good deal on my heart, too.
  So I thought of speaking to  you about it to-night.
  You remember Tom Rollins, the Junior who was so  good to me when I entered college?"    The father nodded.
  He remembered very well indeed the annoying  incidents of his son's first escapade, and how Rollins had stood by him  and helped to avoid a public disgrace, and how a close friendship had  grown between the two boys, so different in their fortunes.
    "Yes," he said, "I remember him.
  He was a promising young man.
  Has he  succeeded?"    "Not exactly--that is not yet.
  His business has been going rather  badly.
  He has a wife and little baby, you know.
  And now he has broken  down,--something wrong with his lungs.
  The doctor says his only chance  is a year or eighteen months in Colorado.
  I wish we could help him.
"    "How much would it cost?"    "Three or four thousand, perhaps, as a loan.
"    "Does the doctor say he will get well?"    "A fighting chance--the doctor says.
"    The face of the older man changed subtly.
  Not a line was altered, but  it seemed to have a different substance, as if it were carved out of  some firm, imperishable stuff.
    "A fighting chance," he said, "may do for a speculation, but it is not  a good investment.
  You owe something to young Rollins.
  Your grateful  feeling does you credit.
  But don't overwork it.
  Send him three or  four hundred, if you like.
  You'll never hear from it again, except in  the letter of thanks.
  But for Heaven's sake don't be sentimental.
  Religion is not a matter of sentiment; it's a matter of principle.
"    The face of the younger man changed now.
  But instead of becoming fixed  and graven, it seemed to melt into life by the heat of an inward fire.
  His nostrils quivered with quick breath, his lips were curled.
  "Principle!" he said.
  "You mean principal--and interest too.
  Well,  sir, you know best whether that is religion or not.
  But if it is,  count me out, please.
  Tom saved me from going to the devil, six years  ago; and I'll be damned if I don't help him to the best of my ability  now.
"    John Weightman looked at his son steadily.
  "Harold," he said at last,  "you know I dislike violent language, and it never has any influence  with me.
  If I could honestly approve of this proposition of yours, I'd  let you have the money; but I can't; it's extravagant and useless.
  But  you have your Christmas check for a thousand dollars coming to you  to-morrow.
  You can use it as you please.
  I never interfere with your  private affairs.
"    "Thank you," said Harold.
  "Thank you very much!  But there's another  private affair.
  I want to get away from this life, this town, this  house.
  It stifles me.
  You refused last summer when I asked you to let  me go up to Grenfell's Mission on the Labrador.
  I could go now, at  least as far as the Newfoundland Station.
  Have you changed your mind?"    "Not at all.
  I think it is an exceedingly foolish enterprise.
  It  would interrupt the career that I have marked out for you.
"    "Well, then, here's a cheaper proposition.
  Algy Vanderhoof wants me to  join him on his yacht with--well, with a little party--to cruise in the  West Indies.
  Would you prefer that?"    "Certainly not!  The Vanderhoof set is wild and godless--I do not wish  to see you keeping company with fools who walk in the broad and easy  way that leads to perdition.
"    "It is rather a hard choice," said the young man, with a short laugh,  turning toward the door.
  "According to you there's very little  difference--a fool's paradise or a fool's hell!  Well, it's one or the  other for me, and I'll toss up for it to-night: heads, I lose; tails,  the devil wins.
  Anyway, I'm sick of this, and I'm out of it.
"    "Harold," said the older man (and there was a slight tremor in his  voice), "don't let us quarrel on Christmas Eve.
  All I want is to  persuade you to think seriously of the duties and responsibilities to  which God has called you--don't speak lightly of heaven and  hell--remember, there is another life.
"    The young man came back and laid his hand upon his father's shoulder.
    "Father," he said, "I want to remember it.
  I try to believe in it.
  But somehow or other, in this house, it all seems unreal to me.
  No  doubt all you say is perfectly right and wise.
  I don't venture to  argue against it, but I can't feel it--that's all.
  If I'm to have a  soul, either to lose or to save, I must really live.
  Just now neither  the present nor the future means anything to me.
  But surely we won't  quarrel.
  I'm very grateful to you, and we'll part friends.
  Good-night, sir.
"    The father held out his hand in silence.
  The heavy portiere dropped  noiselessly behind the son, and he went up the wide, curving stairway  to his own room.
    Meantime John Weightman sat in his carved chair in the Jacobean  dining-room.
  He felt strangely old and dull.
  The portraits of  beautiful women by Lawrence and Reynolds and Raeburn, which had often  seemed like real company to him, looked remote and uninteresting.
    He fancied something cold and almost unfriendly in their expression, as  if they were staring through him or beyond him.
  They cared nothing for  his principles, his hopes, his disappointments, his successes; they  belonged to another world, in which he had no place.
  At this he felt a  vague resentment, a sense of discomfort that he could not have defined  or explained.
  He was used to being considered, respected, appreciated  at his full value in every region, even in that of his own dreams.
    Presently he rang for the butler, telling him to close the house and  not to sit up, and walked with lagging steps into the long library,  where the shaded lamps were burning.
  His eye fell upon the low shelves  full of costly books, but he had no desire to open them.
  Even the  carefully chosen pictures that hung above them seemed to have lost  their attraction.
  He paused for a moment before an idyll of Corot--a  dance of nymphs around some forgotten altar in a vaporous glade--and  looked at it curiously.
  There was something rapturous and serene about  the picture, a breath of spring-time in the misty trees, a harmony of  joy in the dancing figures, that wakened in him a feeling of  half-pleasure and half-envy.
  It represented something that he had  never known in his calculated, orderly life.
  He was dimly mistrustful  of it.
    "It is certainly very beautiful," he thought, "but it is distinctly  pagan; that altar is built to some heathen god.
  It does not fit into  the scheme of a Christian life.
  I doubt whether it is consistent with  the tone of my house.
  I will sell it this winter.
  It will bring three  or four times what I paid for it.
  That was a good purchase, a very  good bargain.
"    He dropped into the revolving chair before his big library table.
    It was covered with pamphlets and reports of the various enterprises in  which he was interested.
  There was a pile of newspaper clippings in  which his name was mentioned with praise for his sustaining power as a  pillar of finance, for his judicious benevolence, for his support of  wise and prudent reform movements, for his discretion in making  permanent public gifts--"the Weightman Charities," one very complaisant  editor called them, as if they deserved classification as a distinct  species.
  He turned the papers over listlessly.
  There was a description  and a picture of the "Weightman Wing of the Hospital for Cripples," of  which he was president; and an article on the new professor in the  "Weightman Chair of Political Jurisprudence" in Jackson University, of  which he was a trustee; and an illustrated account of the opening of  the "Weightman Grammar-School" at Dulwich-on-the-Sound, where he had  his legal residence for purposes of taxation.
    This last was perhaps the most carefully planned of all the Weightman  Charities.
  He desired to win the confidence and support of his rural  neighbors.
  It had pleased him much when the local newspaper had spoken  of him as an ideal citizen and the logical candidate for the  Governorship of the State; but upon the whole it seemed to him wiser to  keep out of active politics.
  It would be easier and better to put  Harold into the running, to have him sent to the Legislature from the  Dulwich district, then to the national House, then to the Senate.
  Why  not?  The Weightman interests were large enough to need a direct  representative and guardian at Washington.
    But to-night all these plans came back to him with dust upon them.
  They were dry and crumbling like forsaken habitations.
  The son upon  whom his complacent ambition had rested had turned his back upon the  mansion of his father's hopes.
  The break might not be final; and in  any event there would be much to live for; the fortunes of the family  would be secure.
  But the zest of it all would be gone if John  Weightman had to give up the assurance of perpetuating his name and his  principles in his son.
  It was a bitter disappointment, and he felt  that he had not deserved it.
    He rose from the chair and paced the room with leaden feet.
  For the  first time in his life his age was visibly upon him.
  His head was  heavy and hot, and the thoughts that rolled in it were confused and  depressing.
  Could it be that he had made a mistake in the principles  of his existence?  There was no argument in what Harold had said--it  was almost childish--and yet it had shaken the elder man more deeply  than he cared to show.
  It held a silent attack which touched him more  than open criticism.
    Suppose the end of his life were nearer than he thought--the end must  come some time--what if it were now?  Had he not founded his house upon  a rock?  Had he not kept the Commandments?  Was he not, "touching the  law, blameless"?  And beyond this, even if there were some faults in  his character--and all men are sinners--yet he surely believed in the  saving doctrines of religion--the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection  of the body, the life everlasting.
  Yes, that was the true source of  comfort, after all.
  He would read a bit in the Bible, as he did every  night, and go to bed and to sleep.
    He went back to his chair at the library table.
  A strange weight of  weariness rested upon him, but he opened the book at a familiar place,  and his eyes fell upon the verse at the bottom of the page.
    "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth.
"    That had been the text of the sermon a few weeks before.
  Sleepily,  heavily, he tried to fix his mind upon it and recall it.
  What was it  that Doctor Snodgrass had said?  Ah, yes--that it was a mistake to  pause here in reading the verse.
  We must read on without a pause--Lay  not up treasures upon earth where moth and rust do corrupt and where  thieves break through and steal--that was the true doctrine.
  We may  have treasures upon earth, but they must not be put into unsafe places,  but into safe places.
  A most comforting doctrine!  He had always  followed it.
  Moths and rust and thieves had done no harm to his  investments.
    John Weightman's drooping eyes turned to the next verse, at the top of  the second column.
    "But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.
"    Now what had the Doctor said about that?  How was it to be  understood--in what sense--treasures--in heaven?    The book seemed to float away from him.
  The light vanished.
  He  wondered dimly if this could be Death, coming so suddenly, so quietly,  so irresistibly.
  He struggled for a moment to hold himself up, and  then sank slowly forward upon the table.
  His head rested upon his  folded hands.
  He slipped into the unknown.
    How long afterward conscious life returned to him he did not know.
  The  blank might have been an hour or a century.
  He knew only that  something had happened in the interval.
  What is was he could not tell.
  He found great difficulty in catching the thread of his identity again.
  He felt that he was himself; but the trouble was to make his  connections, to verify and place himself, to know who and where he was.
    At last it grew clear.
  John Weightman was sitting on a stone, not far  from a road in a strange land.
    The road was not a formal highway, fenced and graded.
  It was more like  a great travel-trace, worn by thousands of feet passing across the open  country in the same direction.
  Down in the valley, into which he could  look, the road seemed to form itself gradually out of many minor paths;  little footways coming across the meadows, winding tracks following  along beside the streams, faintly marked trails emerging from the  woodlands.
  But on the hillside the threads were more firmly woven into  one clear band of travel, though there were still a few dim paths  joining it here and there, as if persons had been climbing up the hill  by other ways and had turned at last to seek the road.
    From the edge of the hill, where John Weightman sat, he could see the  travelers, in little groups or larger companies, gathering from time to  time by the different paths, and making the ascent.
  They were all  clothed in white, and the form of their garments was strange to him; it  was like some old picture.
  They passed him, group after group, talking  quietly together or singing; not moving in haste, but with a certain  air of eagerness and joy as if they were glad to be on their way to an  appointed place.
  They did not stay to speak to him, but they looked at  him often and spoke to one another as they looked; and now and then one  of them would smile and beckon him a friendly greeting, so that he felt  they would like him to be with them.
    There was quite an interval between the groups; and he followed each of  them with his eyes after it had passed, blanching the long ribbon of  the road for a little transient space, rising and receding across the  wide, billowy upland, among the rounded hillocks of aerial green and  gold and lilac, until it came to the high horizon, and stood outlined  for a moment, a tiny cloud of whiteness against the tender blue, before  it vanished over the hill.
    For a long time he sat there watching and wondering.
  It was a very  different world from that in which his mansion on the Avenue was built;  and it looked strange to him, but most real--as real as anything he had  ever seen.
  Presently he felt a strong desire to know what country it  was and where the people were going.
  He had a faint premonition of  what it must be, but he wished to be sure.
  So he rose from the stone  where he was sitting, and came down through the short grass and the  lavender flowers, toward a passing group of people.
  One of them turned  to meet him, and held out his hand.
  It was an old man, under whose  white beard and brows John Weightman thought he saw a suggestion of the  face of the village doctor who had cared for him years ago, when he was  a boy in the country.
    "Welcome," said the old man.
  "Will you come with us?"    "Where are you going?"    "To the heavenly city, to see our mansions there.
"    "And who are these with you?"    "Strangers to me, until a little while ago; I know them better now.
  But you I have known for a long time, John Weightman.
  Don't you  remember your old doctor?"    "Yes," he cried--"yes; your voice has not changed at all.
  I'm glad  indeed to see you, Doctor McLean, especially now.
  All this seems very  strange to me, almost oppressive.
  I wonder if--but may I go with you,  do you suppose?"    "Surely," answered the doctor, with his familiar smile; "it will do you  good.
  And you also must have a mansion in the city waiting for you--a  fine one, too--are you not looking forward to it?"    "Yes," replied the other, hesitating a moment; "yes--I believe it must  be so, although I had not expected to see it so soon.
  But I will go  with you, and we can talk by the way.
"    The two men quickly caught up with the other people, and all went  forward together along the road.
  The doctor had little to tell of his  experience, for it had been a plain, hard life, uneventfully spent for  others, and the story of the village was very simple.
  John Weightman's  adventures and triumphs would have made a far richer, more imposing  history, full of contacts with the great events and personages of the  time.
  But somehow or other he did not care to speak much about it,  walking on that wide heavenly moorland, under that tranquil, sunless  arch of blue, in that free air of perfect peace, where the light was  diffused without a shadow, as if the spirit of life in all things were  luminous.
    There was only one person besides the doctor in that little company  whom John Weightman had known before--an old bookkeeper who had spent  his life over a desk, carefully keeping accounts--a rusty, dull little  man, patient and narrow, whose wife had been in the insane asylum for  twenty years and whose only child was a crippled daughter, for whose  comfort and happiness he had toiled and sacrificed himself without  stint.
  It was a surprise to find him here, as care-free and joyful as  the rest.
    The lives of others in the company were revealed in brief glimpses as  they talked together--a mother, early widowed, who had kept her little  flock of children together and labored through hard and heavy years to  bring them up in purity and knowledge--a Sister of Charity who had  devoted herself to the nursing of poor folk who were being eaten to  death by cancer--a schoolmaster whose heart and life had been poured  into his quiet work of training boys for a clean and thoughtful  manhood--a medical missionary who had given up a brilliant career in  science to take the charge of a hospital in darkest Africa--a beautiful  woman with silver hair who had resigned her dreams of love and marriage  to care for an invalid father, and after his death had made her life a  long, steady search for ways of doing kindnesses to others--a poet who  had walked among the crowded tenements of the great city, bringing  cheer and comfort not only by his songs, but by his wise and patient  works of practical aid--a paralyzed woman who had lain for thirty years  upon her bed, helpless but not hopeless, succeeding by a miracle of  courage in her single aim, never to complain, but always to impart a  bit of joy and peace to every one who came near her.
  All these, and  other persons like them, people of little consideration in the world,  but now seemingly all full of great contentment and an inward gladness  that made their steps light, were in the company that passed along the  road, talking together of things past and things to come, and singing  now and then with clear voices from which the veil of age and sorrow  was lifted.
    John Weightman joined in some of the songs--which were familiar to him  from their use in the church--at first with a touch of hesitation, and  then more confidently.
  For as they went on his sense of strangeness  and fear at his new experience diminished, and his thoughts began to  take on their habitual assurance and complacency.
  Were not these  people going to the Celestial City?  And was not he in his right place  among them?  He had always looked forward to this journey.
  If they  were sure, each one, of finding a mansion there, could not he be far  more sure?  His life had been more fruitful than theirs.
  He had been a  leader, a founder of new enterprises, a pillar of Church and State, a  prince of the House of Israel.
  Ten talents had been given him, and he  had made them twenty.
  His reward would be proportionate.
  He was glad  that his companions were going to find fit dwellings prepared for them;  but he thought also with a certain pleasure of the surprise that some  of them would feel when they saw his appointed mansion.
    So they came to the summit of the moorland and looked over into the  world beyond.
  It was a vast, green plain, softly rounded like a  shallow vase, and circled with hills of amethyst.
  A broad, shining  river flowed through it, and many silver threads of water were woven  across the green; and there were borders of tall trees on the banks of  the river, and orchards full of roses abloom along the little streams,  and in the midst of all stood the city, white and wonderful and radiant.
    When the travelers saw it they were filled with awe and joy.
  They  passed over the little streams and among the orchards quickly and  silently, as if they feared to speak lest the city should vanish.
    The wall of the city was very low, a child could see over it, for it  was made only of precious stones, which are never large.
  The gate of  the city was not like a gate a all, for it was not barred with iron or  wood, but only a single pearl, softly gleaming, marked the place where  the wall ended and the entrance lay open.
    A person stood there whose face was bright and grave, and whose robe  was like the flower of the lily, not a woven fabric, but a living  texture.
  "Come in," he said to the company of travelers; "you are at  your journey's end, and your mansions are ready for you.
"    John Weightman hesitated, for he was troubled by a doubt.
  Suppose that  he was not really, like his companions, at his journey's end, but only  transported for a little while out of the regular course of his life  into this mysterious experience?  Suppose that, after all, he had not  really passed through the door of death, like these others, but only  through the door of dreams, and was walking in a vision, a living man  among the blessed dead.
  Would it be right for him to go with them into  the heavenly city?  Would it not be a deception, a desecration, a deep  and unforgivable offense?  The strange, confusing question had no  reason in it, as he very well knew; for if he was dreaming, then it was  all a dream; but if his companions were real, then he also was with  them in reality, and if they had died then he must have died too.
  Yet  he could not rid his mind of the sense that there was a difference  between them and him, and it made him afraid to go on.
  But, as he  paused and turned, the Keeper of the Gate looked straight and deep into  his eyes, and beckoned to him.
  Then he knew that it was not only right  but necessary that he should enter.
    They passed from street to street among fair and spacious dwellings,  set in amaranthine gardens, and adorned with an infinitely varied  beauty of divine simplicity.
  The mansions differed in size, in shape,  in charm: each one seemed to have its own personal look of loveliness;  yet all were alike in fitness to their place, in harmony with one  another, in the addition which each made to the singular and tranquil  splendor of the city.
    As the little company came, one by one, to the mansions which were  prepared for them, and their Guide beckoned to the happy inhabitant to  enter in and take possession, there was a soft murmur of joy, half  wonder and half recognition; as if the new and immortal dwelling were  crowned with the beauty of surprise, lovelier and nobler than all the  dreams of it had been; and yet also as if it were touched with the  beauty of the familiar, the remembered, the long-loved.
  One after  another the travelers were led to their own mansions, and went in  gladly; and from within, through the open doorways came sweet voices of  welcome, and low laughter, and song.
    At last there was no one left with the Guide but the two old friends,  Doctor McLean and John Weightman.
  They were standing in front of one  of the largest and fairest of the houses, whose garden glowed softly  with radiant flowers.
  The Guide laid his hand upon the doctor's  shoulder.
    "This is for you," he said.
  "Go in; there is no more pain here, no  more death, nor sorrow, nor tears; for your old enemies are all  conquered.
  But all the good that you have done for others, all the  help that you have given, all the comfort that you have brought, all  the strength and love that you have bestowed upon the suffering, are  here; for we have built them all into this mansion for you.
"    The good man's face was lighted with a still joy.
  He clasped his old  friend's hand closely, and whispered: "How wonderful it is!  Go on, you  will come to your mansion next, it is not far away, and we shall see  each other again soon, very soon.
"    So he went through the garden, and into the music within.
  The Keeper  of the Gate turned to John Weightman with level, quiet, searching eyes.
  Then he asked, gravely:    "Where do you wish me to lead you now?"    "To see my own mansion," answered the man, with half-concealed  excitement.
  "Is there not one here for me?  You may not let me enter  it yet, perhaps, for I must confess to you that I am only--"    "I know," said the Keeper of the Gate--"I know it all.
  You are John  Weightman.
"    "Yes," said the man, more firmly than he had spoken at first, for it  gratified him that his name was known.
  "Yes, I am John Weightman,  Senior Warden of St.
 Petronius' Church.
  I wish very much to see my  mansion here, if only for a moment.
  I believe that you have one for  me.
  Will you take me to it?"    The Keeper of the Gate drew a little book from the breast of his robe  and turned over the pages.
    "Certainly," he said, with a curious look at the man, "your name is  here; and you shall see your mansion if you will follow me.
"    It seemed as if they must have walked miles and miles, through the vast  city, passing street after street of houses larger and smaller, of  gardens richer and poorer, but all full of beauty and delight.
    They came into a kind of suburb, where there were many small cottages,  with plots of flowers, very lowly, but bright and fragrant.
  Finally  they reached an open field, bare and lonely-looking.
  There were two or  three little bushes in it, without flowers, and the grass was sparse  and thin.
  In the center of the field was a tiny hut, hardly big enough  for a shepherd's shelter.
  It looked as if it had been built of  discarded things, scraps and fragments of other buildings, put together  with care and pains, by some one who had tried to make the most of  cast-off material.
    There was something pitiful and shamefaced about the hut.
  It shrank  and drooped and faded in its barren field, and seemed to cling only by  sufferance to the edge of the splendid city.
    "This," said the Keeper of the Gate, standing still and speaking with a  low, distinct voice--"this is your mansion, John Weightman.
"    An almost intolerable shock of grieved wonder and indignation choked  the man for a moment so that he could not say a word.
  Then he turned  his face away from the poor little hut and began to remonstrate eagerly  with his companion.
    "Surely, sir," he stammered, "you must be in error about this.
  There  is something wrong--some other John Weightman--a confusion of  names--the book must be mistaken.
"    "There is no mistake," said the Keeper of the Gate, very calmly; "here  is your name, the record of your title and your possessions in this  place.
"    "But how could such a house be prepared for me," cried the man, with a  resentful tremor in his voice--"for me, after my long and faithful  service?  Is this a suitable mansion for one so well known and devoted?  Why is it so pitifully small and mean?  Why have you not built it large  and fair, like the others?"    "That is all the material you sent us.
"    "What!"    "We have used all the material that you sent us," repeated the Keeper  of the Gate.
    "Now I know that you are mistaken," cried the man, with growing  earnestness, "for all my life long I have been doing things that must  have supplied you with material.
  Have you not heard that I have built  a school-house; the wing of a hospital; two--yes, three--small  churches, and the greater part of a large one, the spire of St.
 Petro--"    The Keeper of the Gate lifted his hand.
    "Wait," he said; "we know all these things.
  They were not ill done.
  But they were all marked and used as foundation for the name and  mansion of John Weightman in the world.
  Did you not plan them for  that?"    "Yes," answered the man, confused and taken aback, "I confess that I  thought often of them in that way.
  Perhaps my heart was set upon that  too much.
  But there are other things--my endowment for the college--my  steady and liberal contributions to all the established charities--my  support of every respectable--"    "Wait," said the Keeper of the Gate again.
  "Were not all these  carefully recorded on earth where they would add to your credit?  They  were not foolishly done.
  Verily, you have had your reward for them.
  Would you be paid twice?"    "No," cried the man, with deepening dismay, "I dare not claim that.
  I  acknowledge that I considered my own interest too much.
  But surely not  altogether.
  You have said that these things were not foolishly done.
  They accomplished some good in the world.
  Does not that count for  something?"    "Yes," answered he Keeper of the Gate, "it counts in the world--where  you counted it.
  But it does not belong to you here.
  We have saved and  used everything that you sent us.
  This is the mansion prepared for  you.
"    As he spoke, his look grew deeper and more searching, like a flame of  fire.
  John Weightman could not endure it.
  It seemed to strip him  naked and wither him.
  He sank to the ground under a crushing weight of  shame, covering his eyes with his hands and cowering face downward upon  the stones.
  Dimly through the trouble of his mind he felt their  hardness and coldness.
    "Tell me, then," he cried, brokenly, "since my life has been so little  worth, how came I here at all?"    "Through the mercy of the King"--the answer was like the soft tolling  of a bell.
    "And how have I earned it?" he murmured.
    "It is never earned; it is only given," came the clear, low reply.
    "But how have I failed so wretchedly," he asked, "in all the purpose of  my life?  What could I have done better?  What is it that counts here?"    "Only that which is truly given," answered the bell-like voice.
  "Only  that good which is done for the love of doing it.
  Only those plans in  which the welfare of others is the master thought.
  Only those labors  in which the sacrifice is greater than the reward.
  Only those gifts in  which the giver forgets himself.
"    The man lay silent.
  A great weakness, an unspeakable despondency and  humiliation were upon him.
  But the face of the Keeper of the Gate was  infinitely tender as he bent over him.
    "Think again, John Weightman.
  Has there been nothing like that in your  life?"    "Nothing," he sighed.
  "If there ever were such things, it must have  been long ago--they were all crowded out--I have forgotten them.
"    There was an ineffable smile on the face of the Keeper of the Gate, and  his hand made the sign of the cross over the bowed head as he spoke  gently:    "These are the things that the King never forgets; and because there  were a few of them in your life, you have a little place here.
"    The sense of coldness and hardness under John Weightman's hands grew  sharper and more distinct.
  The feeling of bodily weariness and  lassitude weighed upon him, but there was a calm, almost a lightness,  in his heart as he listened to the fading vibrations of the silvery  bell-tones.
  The chimney clock on the mantel had just ended the last  stroke of seven as he lifted his head from the table.
  Thin, pale  strips of the city morning were falling into the room through the  narrow partings of the heavy curtains.
    What was it that had happened to him?  Had he been ill?  Had he died  and come to life again?  Or had he only slept, and had his soul gone  visiting in dreams?  He sat for some time, motionless, not lost, but  finding himself in thought.
  Then he took a narrow book from the table  drawer, wrote a check, and tore it out.
    He went slowly up the stairs, knocked very softly at his son's door,  and, hearing no answer, entered without noise.
  Harold was asleep, his  bare arm thrown above his head, and his eager face relaxed in peace.
  His father looked at him a moment with strangely shining eyes, and then  tiptoed quietly to the writing-desk, found a pencil and a sheet of  paper, and wrote rapidly:    "My dear boy, here is what you asked me for; do what you like with it,  and ask for more if you need it.
  If you are still thinking of that  work with Grenfell, we'll talk it over to-day after church.
  I want to  know your heart better; and if I have made mistakes--"    A slight noise made him turn his head.
  Harold was sitting up in bed  with wide-open eyes.
    "Father!" he cried, "is that you?"    "Yes, my son," answered John Weightman; "I've come back--I mean I've  come up--no, I mean come in--well, here I am, and God give us a good  Christmas together.

                  The King of the Golden River    by    John Ruskin          PREFACE    "The King of the Golden River" is a delightful fairy tale told with all  Ruskin's charm of style, his appreciation of mountain scenery, and with  his usual insistence upon drawing a moral.
  None the less, it is quite  unlike his other writings.
  All his life long his pen was busy  interpreting nature and pictures and architecture, or persuading to  better views those whom he believed to be in error, or arousing, with  the white heat of a prophet's zeal, those whom he knew to be  unawakened.
 There is indeed a good deal of the prophet about John  Ruskin.
  Though essentially an interpreter with a singularly fine  appreciation of beauty, no man of the nineteenth century felt more  keenly that he had a mission, and none was more loyal to what he  believed that mission to be.
    While still in college, what seemed a chance incident gave occasion and  direction to this mission.
 A certain English reviewer had ridiculed the  work of the artist Turner.
  Now Ruskin held Turner to be the greatest  landscape painter the world had seen, and he immediately wrote a  notable article in his defense.
  Slowly this article grew into a  pamphlet, and the pamphlet into a book, the first volume of "Modern  Painters.
"  The young man awoke to find himself famous.
  In the next  few years four more volumes were added to "Modern Painters," and the  other notable series upon art, "The Stones of Venice" and "The Seven  Lamps of Architecture," were sent forth.
    Then, in 1860, when Ruskin was about forty years old, there came a  great change.
  His heaven-born genius for making the appreciation of  beauty a common possession was deflected from its true field.
  He had  been asking himself what are the conditions that produce great art, and  the answer he found declared that art cannot be separated from life,  nor life from industry and industrial conditions.
  A civilization  founded upon unrestricted competition therefore seemed to him  necessarily feeble in appreciation of the beautiful, and unequal to its  creation.
 In this way loyalty to his mission bred apparent disloyalty.
  Delightful discourses upon art gave way to fervid pleas for humanity.
  For the rest of his life he became a very earnest, if not always very  wise, social reformer and a passionate pleader for what he believed to  be true economic ideals.
    There is nothing of all this in "The King of the Golden River.
" Unlike  his other works, it was written merely to entertain.
  Scarcely that,  since it was not written for publication at all, but to meet a  challenge set him by a young girl.
    The circumstance is interesting.
  After taking his degree at Oxford,  Ruskin was threatened with consumption and hurried away from the chill  and damp of England to the south of Europe.
  After two years of  fruitful travel and study he came back improved in health but not  strong, and often depressed in spirit.
  It was at this time that the  Guys, Scotch friends of his father and mother, came for a visit to his  home near London, and with them their little daughter Euphemia.
  The  coming of this beautiful, vivacious, light-hearted child opened a new  n Ruskin's life.
  Though but twelve years old, she sought to  enliven the melancholy student, absorbed in art and geology, and bade  him leave these and write for her a fairy tale.
  He accepted, and after  but two sittings, presented her with this charming story.
 The incident  proved to have awakened in him a greater interest than at first  appeared, for a few years later "Effie" Grey became John Ruskin's wife.
  Meantime she had given the manuscript to a friend.
  Nine years after it  was written, this friend, with John Ruskin's permission, gave the story  to the world.
    It was published in London in 1851, with illustrations by the  celebrated Richard Doyle, and at once became a favorite.
  Three  editions were printed the first year, and soon it had found its way  into German, Italian, and Welsh.
  Since then countless children have  had cause to be grateful for the young girl's challenge that won the  story of Gluck's golden mug and the highly satisfactory handling of the  Black Brothers by Southwest Wind, Esquire.
    For this edition new drawings have been prepared by Mr. Hiram P.
  Barnes.
  They very successfully preserve the spirit of Doyle's  illustrations, which unfortunately are not technically suitable for  reproduction here.
    In the original manuscript there was an epilogue bearing the heading  "Charitie"--a morning hymn of Treasure Valley, whither Gluck had  returned to dwell, and where the inheritance lost by cruelty was  regained by love:    The beams of morning are renewed The valley laughs their light to see  And earth is bright with gratitude And heaven with charitie.

 SCHWARTZ SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW  HE PROSPERED THEREIN          HOW LITTLE GLUCK SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW  HE PROSPERED THEREIN, WITH OTHER MATTERS OF INTEREST            THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER              HOW THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM OF THE BLACK BROTHERS WAS INTERFERED WITH  BY SOUTHWEST WIND, ESQUIRE      In a secluded and mountainous part of Stiria there was in old time a  valley of the most surprising and luxuriant fertility.
  It was  surrounded on all sides by steep and rocky mountains rising into peaks  which were always covered with snow and from which a number of torrents  descended in constant cataracts.
  One of these fell westward over the  face of a crag so high that when the sun had set to everything else,  and all below was darkness, his beams still shone full upon this  waterfall, so that it looked like a shower of gold.
  It was therefore  called by the people of the neighborhood the Golden River.
  It was  strange that none of these streams fell into the valley itself.
  They  all descended on the other side of the mountains and wound away through  broad plains and by populous cities.
  But the clouds were drawn so  constantly to the snowy hills, and rested so softly in the circular  hollow, that in time of drought and heat, when all the country round  was burned up, there was still rain in the little valley; and its crops  were so heavy, and its hay so high, and its apples so red, and its  grapes so blue, and its wine so rich, and its honey so sweet, that it  was a marvel to everyone who beheld it and was commonly called the  Treasure Valley.
    The whole of this little valley belonged to three brothers, called  Schwartz, Hans, and Gluck.
  Schwartz and Hans, the two elder brothers,  were very ugly men, with overhanging eyebrows and small, dull eyes  which were always half shut, so that you couldn't see into THEM and  always fancied they saw very far into YOU.
  They lived by farming the  Treasure Valley, and very good farmers they were.
  They killed  everything that did not pay for its eating.
  They shot the blackbirds  because they pecked the fruit, and killed the hedgehogs lest they  should suck the cows; they poisoned the crickets for eating the crumbs  in the kitchen, and smothered the cicadas which used to sing all summer  in the lime trees.
  They worked their servants without any wages till  they would not work any more, and then quarreled with them and turned  them out of doors without paying them.
  It would have been very odd if  with such a farm and such a system of farming they hadn't got very  rich; and very rich they DID get.
  They generally contrived to keep  their corn by them till it was very dear, and then sell it for twice  its value; they had heaps of gold lying about on their floors, yet it  was never known that they had given so much as a penny or a crust in  charity; they never went to Mass, grumbled perpetually at paying  tithes, and were, in a word, of so cruel and grinding a temper as to  receive from all those with whom they had any dealings the nickname of  the "Black Brothers.
"    The youngest brother, Gluck, was as completely opposed, in both  appearance and character, to his seniors as could possibly be imagined  or desired.
  He was not above twelve years old, fair, blue-eyed, and  kind in temper to every living thing.
  He did not, of course, agree  particularly well with his brothers, or, rather, they did not agree  with HIM.
  He was usually appointed to the honorable office of  turnspit, when there was anything to roast, which was not often, for,  to do the brothers justice, they were hardly less sparing upon  themselves than upon other people.
  At other times he used to clean the  shoes, floors, and sometimes the plates, occasionally getting what was  left on them, by way of encouragement, and a wholesome quantity of dry  blows by way of education.
    Things went on in this manner for a long time.
  At last came a very wet  summer, and everything went wrong in the country round.
  The hay had  hardly been got in when the haystacks were floated bodily down to the  sea by an inundation; the vines were cut to pieces with the hail; the  corn was all killed by a black blight.
  Only in the Treasure Valley, as  usual, all was safe.
  As it had rain when there was rain nowhere else,  so it had sun when there was sun nowhere else.
  Everybody came to buy  corn at the farm and went away pouring maledictions on the Black  Brothers.
  They asked what they liked and got it, except from the poor  people, who could only beg, and several of whom were starved at their  very door without the slightest regard or notice.
    It was drawing towards winter, and very cold weather, when one day the  two elder brothers had gone out, with their usual warning to little  Gluck, who was left to mind the roast, that he was to let nobody in and  give nothing out.
  Gluck sat down quite close to the fire, for it was  raining very hard and the kitchen walls were by no means dry or  comfortable-looking.
  He turned and turned, and the roast got nice and  brown.
  "What a pity," thought Gluck, "my brothers never ask anybody to  dinner.
  I'm sure, when they've got such a nice piece of mutton as  this, and nobody else has got so much as a piece of dry bread, it would  do their hearts good to have somebody to eat it with them.
"    Just as he spoke there came a double knock at the house door, yet heavy  and dull, as though the knocker had been tied up--more like a puff than  a knock.
    "It must be the wind," said Gluck; "nobody else would venture to knock  double knocks at our door.
"    No, it wasn't the wind; there it came again very hard, and, what was  particularly astounding, the knocker seemed to be in a hurry and not to  be in the least afraid of the consequences.
  Gluck went to the window,  opened it, and put his head out to see who it was.
    It was the most extraordinary-looking little gentleman he had ever seen  in his life.
  He had a very large nose, slightly brass-colored; his  cheeks were very round and very red, and might have warranted a  supposition that he had been blowing a refractory fire for the last  eight-and-forty hours; his eyes twinkled merrily through long, silky  eyelashes; his mustaches curled twice round like a corkscrew on each  side of his mouth; and his hair, of a curious mixed pepper-and-salt  color, descended far over his shoulders.
  He was about four feet six in  height and wore a conical pointed cap of nearly the same altitude,  decorated with a black feather some three feet long.
  His doublet was  prolonged behind into something resembling a violent exaggeration of  what is now termed a "swallowtail," but was much obscured by the  swelling folds of an enormous black, glossy-looking cloak, which must  have been very much too long in calm weather, as the wind, whistling  round the old house, carried it clear out from the wearer's shoulders  to about four times his own length.
    Gluck was so perfectly paralyzed by the singular appearance of his  visitor that he remained fixed without uttering a word, until the old  gentleman, having performed another and a more energetic concerto on  the knocker, turned round to look after his flyaway cloak.
  In so doing  he caught sight of Gluck's little yellow head jammed in the window,  with its mouth and eyes very wide open indeed.
    "Hollo!" said the little gentleman; "that's not the way to answer the  door.
  I'm wet; let me in.
"    To do the little gentleman justice, he WAS wet.
  His feather hung down  between his legs like a beaten puppy's tail, dripping like an umbrella,  and from the ends of his mustaches the water was running into his  waistcoat pockets and out again like a mill stream.
    "I beg pardon, sir," said Gluck, "I'm very sorry, but, I really can't.
"    "Can't what?" said the old gentleman.
    "I can't let you in, sir--I can't, indeed; my brothers would beat me to  death, sir, if I thought of such a thing.
  What do you want, sir?"    "Want?" said the old gentleman petulantly.
  "I want fire and shelter,  and there's your great fire there blazing, crackling, and dancing on  the walls with nobody to feel it.
  Let me in, I say; I only want to  warm myself.
"    Gluck had had his head, by this time, so long out of the window that he  began to feel it was really unpleasantly cold, and when he turned and  saw the beautiful fire rustling and roaring and throwing long, bright  tongues up the chimney, as if it were licking its chops at the savory  smell of the leg of mutton, his heart melted within him that it should  be burning away for nothing.
  "He does look very wet," said little  Gluck; "I'll just let him in for a quarter of an hour.
"  Round he went  to the door and opened it; and as the little gentleman walked in, there  came a gust of wind through the house that made the old chimneys totter.
    "That's a good boy," said the little gentleman.
  "Never mind your  brothers.
  I'll talk to them.
"    "Pray, sir, don't do any such thing," said Gluck.
  "I can't let you  stay till they come; they'd be the death of me.
"    "Dear me," said the old gentleman, "I'm very sorry to hear that.
  How  long may I stay?"    "Only till the mutton's done, sir," replied Gluck, "and it's very  brown.
"    Then the old gentleman walked into the kitchen and sat himself down on  the hob, with the top of his cap accommodated up the chimney, for it  was a great deal too high for the roof.
    "You'll soon dry there, sir," said Gluck, and sat down again to turn  the mutton.
  But the old gentleman did NOT dry there, but went on drip,  drip, dripping among the cinders, and the fire fizzed and sputtered and  began to look very black and uncomfortable.
  Never was such a cloak;  every fold in it ran like a gutter.
    "I beg pardon, sir," said Gluck at length, after watching the water  spreading in long, quicksilver-like streams over the floor for a  quarter of an hour; "mayn't I take your cloak?"    "No, thank you," said the old gentleman.
    "Your cap, sir?"    "I am all right, thank you," said the old gentleman rather gruffly.
    "But--sir--I'm very sorry," said Gluck hesitatingly, "but--really,  sir--you're--putting the fire out.
"    "It'll take longer to do the mutton, then," replied his visitor dryly.
    Gluck was very much puzzled by the behavior of his guest; it was such a  strange mixture of coolness and humility.
  He turned away at the string  meditatively for another five minutes.
    "That mutton looks very nice," said the old gentleman at length.
  "Can't you give me a little bit?"    "Impossible, sir," said Gluck.
    "I'm very hungry," continued the old gentleman.
  "I've had nothing to  eat yesterday nor to-day.
  They surely couldn't miss a bit from the  knuckle!"    He spoke in so very melancholy a tone that it quite melted Gluck's  heart.
  "They promised me one slice to-day, sir," said he; "I can give  you that, but not a bit more.
"    "That's a good boy," said the old gentleman again.
    Then Gluck warmed a plate and sharpened a knife.
  "I don't care if I do  get beaten for it," thought he.
  Just as he had cut a large slice out  of the mutton there came a tremendous rap at the door.
  The old  gentleman jumped off the hob as if it had suddenly become  inconveniently warm.
  Gluck fitted the slice into the mutton again,  with desperate efforts at exactitude, and ran to open the door.
    "What did you keep us waiting in the rain for?" said Schwartz, as he  walked in, throwing his umbrella in Gluck's face.
    "Aye! what for, indeed, you little vagabond?" said Hans, administering  an educational box on the ear as he followed his brother into the  kitchen.
    "Bless my soul!" said Schwartz when he opened the door.
    "Amen," said the little gentleman, who had taken his cap off and was  standing in the middle of the kitchen, bowing with the utmost possible  velocity.
    "Who's that?" said Schwartz, catching up a rolling-pin and turning to  Gluck with a fierce frown.
    "I don't know, indeed, brother," said Gluck in great terror.
    "How did he get in?" roared Schwartz.
    "My dear brother," said Gluck deprecatingly, "he was so VERY wet!"    The rolling-pin was descending on Gluck's head, but, at the instant,  the old gentleman interposed his conical cap, on which it crashed with  a shock that shook the water out of it all over the room.
  What was  very odd, the rolling-pin no sooner touched the cap than it flew out of  Schwartz's hand, spinning like a straw in a high wind, and fell into  the corner at the further end of the room.
    "Who are you, sir?" demanded Schwartz, turning upon him.
 "What's your  business?" snarled Hans.
    "I'm a poor old man, sir," the little gentleman began very modestly,  "and I saw your fire through the window and begged shelter for a  quarter of an hour.
"    "Have the goodness to walk out again, then," said Schwartz.
  "We've  quite enough water in our kitchen without making it a drying house.
"    "It is a cold day to turn an old man out in, sir; look at my gray  hairs.
"  They hung down to his shoulders, as I told you before.
    "Aye!" said Hans; "there are enough of them to keep you warm.
  Walk!"    "I'm very, very hungry, sir; couldn't you spare me a bit of bread  before I go?"    "Bread, indeed!" said Schwartz; "do you suppose we've nothing to do  with our bread but to give it to such red-nosed fellows as you?"    "Why don't you sell your feather?" said Hans sneeringly.
 "Out with you!"    "A little bit," said the old gentleman.
    "Be off!" said Schwartz.
    "Pray, gentlemen.
"    "Off, and be hanged!" cried Hans, seizing him by the collar.
  But he  had no sooner touched the old gentleman's collar than away he went  after the rolling-pin, spinning round and round till he fell into the  corner on the top of it.
  Then Schwartz was very angry and ran at the  old gentleman to turn him out; but he also had hardly touched him when  away he went after Hans and the rolling-pin, and hit his head against  the wall as he tumbled into the corner.
  And so there they lay, all  three.
    Then the old gentleman spun himself round with velocity in the opposite  direction, continued to spin until his long cloak was all wound neatly  about him, clapped his cap on his head, very much on one side (for it  could not stand upright without going through the ceiling), gave an  additional twist to his corkscrew mustaches, and replied with perfect  coolness: "Gentlemen, I wish you a very good morning.
  At twelve  o'clock tonight I'll call again; after such a refusal of hospitality as  I have just experienced, you will not be surprised if that visit is the  last I ever pay you.
"    "If ever I catch you here again," muttered Schwartz, coming, half  frightened, out of the corner--but before he could finish his sentence  the old gentleman had shut the house door behind him with a great bang,  and there drove past the window at the same instant a wreath of ragged  cloud that whirled and rolled away down the valley in all manner of  shapes, turning over and over in the air and melting away at last in a  gush of rain.
    "A very pretty business, indeed, Mr. Gluck!" said Schwartz.
 "Dish the  mutton, sir.
 If ever I catch you at such a trick again--bless me, why,  the mutton's been cut!"    "You promised me one slice, brother, you know," said Gluck.
    "Oh! and you were cutting it hot, I suppose, and going to catch all the  gravy.
  It'll be long before I promise you such a thing again.
  Leave  the room, sir; and have the kindness to wait in the coal cellar till I  call you.
"    Gluck left the room melancholy enough.
  The brothers ate as much mutton  as they could, locked the rest in the cupboard, and proceeded to get  very drunk after dinner.
    Such a night as it was!  Howling wind and rushing rain, without  intermission.
  The brothers had just sense enough left to put up all  the shutters and double-bar the door before they went to bed.
  They  usually slept in the same room.
  As the clock struck twelve they were  both awakened by a tremendous crash.
  Their door burst open with a  violence that shook the house from top to bottom.
    "What's that?" cried Schwartz, starting up in his bed.
    "Only I," said the little gentleman.
    The two brothers sat up on their bolster and stared into the darkness.
  The room was full of water, and by a misty moonbeam, which found its  way through a hole in the shutter, they could see in the midst of it an  enormous foam globe, spinning round and bobbing up and down like a  cork, on which, as on a most luxurious cushion, reclined the little old  gentleman, cap and all.
  There was plenty of room for it now, for the  roof was off.
    "Sorry to incommode you," said their visitor ironically.
 "I'm afraid  your beds are dampish.
  Perhaps you had better go to your brother's  room; I've left the ceiling on there.
"    They required no second admonition, but rushed into Gluck's room, wet  through and in an agony of terror.
    "You'll find my card on the kitchen table," the old gentleman called  after them.
  "Remember, the LAST visit.
"    "Pray Heaven it may!" said Schwartz, shuddering.
  And the foam globe  disappeared.
    Dawn came at last, and the two brothers looked out of Gluck's little  window in the morning.
  The Treasure Valley was one mass of ruin and  desolation.
  The inundation had swept away trees, crops, and cattle,  and left in their stead a waste of red sand and gray mud.
  The two  brothers crept shivering and horror-struck into the kitchen.
  The water  had gutted the whole first floor; corn, money, almost every movable  thing, had been swept away, and there was left only a small white card  on the kitchen table.
  On it, in large, breezy, long-legged letters,  were engraved the words:    SOUTH WEST WIND, ESQUIRE              OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER THE VISIT OF SOUTHWEST  WIND, ESQUIRE; AND HOW LITTLE GLUCK HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH THE KING OF  THE GOLDEN RIVER      Southwest Wind, Esquire, was as good as his word.
  After the momentous  visit above related, he entered the Treasure Valley no more; and, what  was worse, he had so much influence with his relations, the West Winds  in general, and used it so effectually, that they all adopted a similar  line of conduct.
  So no rain fell in the valley from one year's end to  another.
  Though everything remained green and flourishing in the  plains below, the inheritance of the three brothers was a desert.
  What  had once been the richest soil in the kingdom became a shifting heap of  red sand, and the brothers, unable longer to contend with the adverse  skies, abandoned their valueless patrimony in despair, to seek some  means of gaining a livelihood among the cities and people of the  plains.
  All their money was gone, and they had nothing left but some  curious old-fashioned pieces of gold plate, the last remnants of their  ill-gotten wealth.
    "Suppose we turn goldsmiths," said Schwartz to Hans as they entered the  large city.
  "It is a good knave's trade; we can put a great deal of  copper into the gold without anyone's finding it out.
"    The thought was agreed to be a very good one; they hired a furnace and  turned goldsmiths.
  But two slight circumstances affected their trade:  the first, that people did not approve of the coppered gold; the  second, that the two elder brothers, whenever they had sold anything,  used to leave little Gluck to mind the furnace, and go and drink out  the money in the alehouse next door.
 So they melted all their gold  without making money enough to buy more, and were at last reduced to  one large drinking mug, which an uncle of his had given to little  Gluck, and which he was very fond of and would not have parted with for  the world, though he never drank anything out of it but milk and water.
  The mug was a very odd mug to look at.
  The handle was formed of two  wreaths of flowing golden hair, so finely spun that it looked more like  silk than metal, and these wreaths descended into and mixed with a  beard and whiskers of the same exquisite workmanship, which surrounded  and decorated a very fierce little face, of the reddest gold  imaginable, right in the front of the mug, with a pair of eyes in it  which seemed to command its whole circumference.
  It was impossible to  drink out of the mug without being subjected to an intense gaze out of  the side of these eyes, and Schwartz positively averred that once,  after emptying it, full of Rhenish, seventeen times, he had seen them  wink!  When it came to the mug's turn to be made into spoons, it half  broke poor little Gluck's heart; but the brothers only laughed at him,  tossed the mug into the melting pot, and staggered out to the alehouse,  leaving him, as usual, to pour the gold into bars when it was all ready.
    When they were gone, Gluck took a farewell look at his old friend in  the melting pot.
  The flowing hair was all gone; nothing remained but  the red nose and the sparkling eyes, which looked more malicious than  ever.
  "And no wonder," thought Gluck, "after being treated in that  way.
"  He sauntered disconsolately to the window and sat himself down  to catch the fresh evening air and escape the hot breath of the  furnace.
  Now this window commanded a direct view of the range of  mountains which, as I told you before, overhung the Treasure Valley,  and more especially of the peak from which fell the Golden River.
  It  was just at the close of the day, and when Gluck sat down at the  window, he saw the rocks of the mountain tops, all crimson and purple  with the sunset; and there were bright tongues of fiery cloud burning  and quivering about them; and the river, brighter than all, fell, in a  waving column of pure gold, from precipice to precipice, with the  double arch of a broad purple rainbow stretched across it, flushing and  fading alternately in the wreaths of spray.
    "Ah!" said Gluck aloud, after he had looked at it for a little while,  "if that river were really all gold, what a nice thing it would be.
"    "No, it wouldn't, Gluck," said a clear, metallic voice close at his ear.
    "Bless me, what's that?" exclaimed Gluck, jumping up.
  There was nobody  there.
  He looked round the room and under the table and a great many  times behind him, but there was certainly nobody there, and he sat down  again at the window.
  This time he didn't speak, but he couldn't help  thinking again that it would be very convenient if the river were  really all gold.
    "Not at all, my boy," said the same voice, louder than before.
    "Bless me!" said Gluck again, "what is that?"  He looked again into all  the corners and cupboards, and then began turning round and round as  fast as he could, in the middle of the room, thinking there was  somebody behind him, when the same voice struck again on his ear.
  It  was singing now, very merrily, "Lala-lira-la"--no words, only a soft,  running, effervescent melody, something like that of a kettle on the  boil.
  Gluck looked out of the window; no, it was certainly in the  house.
  Upstairs and downstairs; no, it was certainly in that very  room, coming in quicker time and clearer notes every moment:  "Lala-lira-la.
"  All at once it struck Gluck that it sounded louder  near the furnace.
  He ran to the opening and looked in.
  Yes, he saw  right; it seemed to be coming not only out of the furnace but out of  the pot.
  He uncovered it, and ran back in a great fright, for the pot  was certainly singing!  He stood in the farthest corner of the room,  with his hands up and his mouth open, for a minute or two, when the  singing stopped and the voice became clear and pronunciative.
    "Hollo!" said the voice.
    Gluck made no answer.
    "Hollo! Gluck, my boy," said the pot again.
    Gluck summoned all his energies, walked straight up to the crucible,  drew it out of the furnace, and looked in.
  The gold was all melted and  its surface as smooth and polished as a river, but instead of  reflecting little Gluck's head, as he looked in he saw, meeting his  glance from beneath the gold, the red nose and sharp eyes of his old  friend of the mug, a thousand times redder and sharper than ever he had  seen them in his life.
    "Come, Gluck, my boy," said the voice out of the pot again, "I'm all  right; pour me out.
"    But Gluck was too much astonished to do anything of the kind.
    "Pour me out, I say," said the voice rather gruffly.
    Still Gluck couldn't move.
    "WILL you pour me out?" said the voice passionately.
  "I'm too hot.
"    By a violent effort Gluck recovered the use of his limbs, took hold of  the crucible, and sloped it, so as to pour out the gold.
  But instead  of a liquid stream there came out, first a pair of pretty little yellow  legs, then some coat tails, then a pair of arms stuck akimbo, and  finally the well-known head of his friend the mug--all which articles,  uniting as they rolled out, stood up energetically on the floor in the  shape of a little golden dwarf about a foot and a half high.
    "That's right!" said the dwarf, stretching out first his legs and then  his arms, and then shaking his head up and down and as far round as it  would go, for five minutes without stopping, apparently with the view  of ascertaining if he were quite correctly put together, while Gluck  stood contemplating him in speechless amazement.
  He was dressed in a  slashed doublet of spun gold, so fine in its texture that the prismatic  colors gleamed over it as if on a surface of mother-of-pearl; and over  this brilliant doublet his hair and beard fell full halfway to the  ground in waving curls, so exquisitely delicate that Gluck could hardly  tell where they ended; they seemed to melt into air.
  The features of  the face, however, were by no means finished with the same delicacy;  they were rather coarse, slightly inclining to coppery in complexion,  and indicative, in expression, of a very pertinacious and intractable  disposition in their small proprietor.
  When the dwarf had finished his  self-examination, he turned his small, sharp eyes full on Gluck and  stared at him deliberately for a minute or two.
  "No, it wouldn't,  Gluck, my boy," said the little man.
    This was certainly rather an abrupt and unconnected mode of commencing  conversation.
  It might indeed be supposed to refer to the course of  Gluck's thoughts, which had first produced the dwarf's observations out  of the pot; but whatever it referred to, Gluck had no inclination to  dispute the dictum.
    "Wouldn't it, sir?" said Gluck very mildly and submissively indeed.
    "No," said the dwarf, conclusively, "no, it wouldn't.
"  And with that  the dwarf pulled his cap hard over his brows and took two turns, of  three feet long, up and down the room, lifting his legs up very high  and setting them down very hard.
  This pause gave time for Gluck to  collect his thoughts a little, and, seeing no great reason to view his  diminutive visitor with dread, and feeling his curiosity overcome his  amazement, he ventured on a question of peculiar delicacy.
    "Pray, sir," said Gluck, rather hesitatingly, "were you my mug?"    On which the little man turned sharp round, walked straight up to  Gluck, and drew himself up to his full height.
  "I," said the little  man, "am the King of the Golden River.
"  Whereupon he turned about  again and took two more turns, some six feet long, in order to allow  time for the consternation which this announcement produced in his  auditor to evaporate.
  After which he again walked up to Gluck and  stood still, as if expecting some comment on his communication.
    Gluck determined to say something at all events.
  "I hope your Majesty  is very well," said Gluck.
    "Listen!" said the little man, deigning no reply to this polite  inquiry.
  "I am the king of what you mortals call the Golden River.
  The shape you saw me in was owing to the malice of a stronger king,  from whose enchantments you have this instant freed me.
  What I have  seen of you and your conduct to your wicked brothers renders me willing  to serve you; therefore, attend to what I tell you.
  Whoever shall  climb to the top of that mountain from which you see the Golden River  issue, and shall cast into the stream at its source three drops of holy  water, for him and for him only the river shall turn to gold.
  But no  one failing in his first can succeed in a second attempt, and if anyone  shall cast unholy water into the river, it will overwhelm him and he  will become a black stone.
"  So saying, the King of the Golden River  turned away and deliberately walked into the center of the hottest  flame of the furnace.
  His figure became red, white, transparent,  dazzling,--a blaze of intense light,--rose, trembled, and disappeared.
  The King of the Golden River had evaporated.
    "Oh!" cried poor Gluck, running to look up the chimney after him, "O  dear, dear, dear me! My mug! my mug! my mug!"              HOW MR.
 HANS SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW HE  PROSPERED THEREIN      The King of the Golden River had hardly made the extraordinary exit  related in the last chapter, before Hans and Schwartz came roaring into  the house very savagely drunk.
  The discovery of the total loss of  their last piece of plate had the effect of sobering them just enough  to enable them to stand over Gluck, beating him very steadily for a  quarter of an hour; at the expiration of which period they dropped into  a couple of chairs and requested to know what he had got to say for  himself.
  Gluck told them his story, of which, of course, they did not  believe a word.
  They beat him again, till their arms were tired, and  staggered to bed.
  In the morning, however, the steadiness with which  he adhered to his story obtained him some degree of credence; the  immediate consequence of which was that the two brothers, after  wrangling a long time on the knotty question, which of them should try  his fortune first, drew their swords and began fighting.
  The noise of  the fray alarmed the neighbors, who, finding they could not pacify the  combatants, sent for the constable.
    Hans, on hearing this, contrived to escape, and hid himself; but  Schwartz was taken before the magistrate, fined for breaking the peace,  and, having drunk out his last penny the evening before, was thrown  into prison till he should pay.
    When Hans heard this, he was much delighted, and determined to set out  immediately for the Golden River.
  How to get the holy water was the  question.
  He went to the priest, but the priest could not give any  holy water to so abandoned a character.
  So Hans went to vespers in the  evening for the first time in his life and, under pretense of crossing  himself, stole a cupful and returned home in triumph.
    Next morning he got up before the sun rose, put the holy water into a  strong flask, and two bottles of wine and some meat in a basket, slung  them over his back, took his alpine staff in his hand, and set off for  the mountains.
    On his way out of the town he had to pass the prison, and as he looked  in at the windows, whom should he see but Schwartz himself peeping out  of the bars and looking very disconsolate.
    "Good morning, brother," said Hans; "have you any message for the King  of the Golden River?"    Schwartz gnashed his teeth with rage and shook the bars with all his  strength, but Hans only laughed at him and, advising him to make  himself comfortable till he came back again, shouldered his basket,  shook the bottle of holy water in Schwartz's face till it frothed  again, and marched off in the highest spirits in the world.
    It was indeed a morning that might have made anyone happy, even with no  Golden River to seek for.
  Level lines of dewy mist lay stretched along  the valley, out of which rose the massy mountains, their lower cliffs  in pale gray shadow, hardly distinguishable from the floating vapor but  gradually ascending till they caught the sunlight, which ran in sharp  touches of ruddy color along the angular crags, and pierced, in long,  level rays, through their fringes of spearlike pine.
  Far above shot up  red, splintered masses of castellated rock, jagged and shivered into  myriads of fantastic forms, with here and there a streak of sunlit snow  traced down their chasms like a line of forked lightning; and far  beyond and far above all these, fainter than the morning cloud but  purer and changeless, slept, in the blue sky, the utmost peaks of the  eternal snow.
    The Golden River, which sprang from one of the lower and snowless  elevations, was now nearly in shadow--all but the uppermost jets of  spray, which rose like slow smoke above the undulating line of the  cataract and floated away in feeble wreaths upon the morning wind.
    On this object, and on this alone, Hans's eyes and thoughts were fixed.
  Forgetting the distance he had to traverse, he set off at an imprudent  rate of walking, which greatly exhausted him before he had scaled the  first range of the green and low hills.
  He was, moreover, surprised,  on surmounting them, to find that a large glacier, of whose existence,  notwithstanding his previous knowledge of the mountains, he had been  absolutely ignorant, lay between him and the source of the Golden  River.
  He entered on it with the boldness of a practiced mountaineer,  yet he thought he had never traversed so strange or so dangerous a  glacier in his life.
  The ice was excessively slippery, and out of all  its chasms came wild sounds of gushing water--not monotonous or low,  but changeful and loud, rising occasionally into drifting passages of  wild melody, then breaking off into short, melancholy tones or sudden  shrieks resembling those of human voices in distress or pain.
  The ice  was broken into thousands of confused shapes, but none, Hans thought,  like the ordinary forms of splintered ice.
  There seemed a curious  EXPRESSION about all their outlines--a perpetual resemblance to living  features, distorted and scornful.
  Myriads of deceitful shadows and  lurid lights played and floated about and through the pale blue  pinnacles, dazzling and confusing the sight of the traveler, while his  ears grew dull and his head giddy with the constant gush and roar of  the concealed waters.
  These painful circumstances increased upon him  as he advanced; the ice crashed and yawned into fresh chasms at his  feet, tottering spires nodded around him and fell thundering across his  path; and though he had repeatedly faced these dangers on the most  terrific glaciers and in the wildest weather, it was with a new and  oppressive feeling of panic terror that he leaped the last chasm and  flung himself, exhausted and shuddering, on the firm turf of the  mountain.
    He had been compelled to abandon his basket of food, which became a  perilous incumbrance on the glacier, and had now no means of refreshing  himself but by breaking off and eating some of the pieces of ice.
  This, however, relieved his thirst; an hour's repose recruited his  hardy frame, and with the indomitable spirit of avarice he resumed his  laborious journey.
    His way now lay straight up a ridge of bare red rocks, without a blade  of grass to ease the foot or a projecting angle to afford an inch of  shade from the south sun.
  It was past noon and the rays beat intensely  upon the steep path, while the whole atmosphere was motionless and  penetrated with heat.
  Intense thirst was soon added to the bodily  fatigue with which Hans was now afflicted; glance after glance he cast  on the flask of water which hung at his belt.
 "Three drops are enough,"  at last thought he; "I may, at least, cool my lips with it.
"    He opened the flask and was raising it to his lips, when his eye fell  on an object lying on the rock beside him; he thought it moved.
  It was  a small dog, apparently in the last agony of death from thirst.
  Its  tongue was out, its jaws dry, its limbs extended lifelessly, and a  swarm of black ants were crawling about its lips and throat.
  Its eye  moved to the bottle which Hans held in his hand.
  He raised it, drank,  spurned the animal with his foot, and passed on.
  And he did not know  how it was, but he thought that a strange shadow had suddenly come  across the blue sky.
    The path became steeper and more rugged every moment, and the high hill  air, instead of refreshing him, seemed to throw his blood into a fever.
  The noise of the hill cataracts sounded like mockery in his ears; they  were all distant, and his thirst increased every moment.
  Another hour  passed, and he again looked down to the flask at his side; it was half  empty, but there was much more than three drops in it.
  He stopped to  open it, and again, as he did so, something moved in the path above  him.
  It was a fair child, stretched nearly lifeless on the rock, its  breast heaving with thirst, its eyes closed, and its lips parched and  burning.
  Hans eyed it deliberately, drank, and passed on.
  And a dark  gray cloud came over the sun, and long, snakelike shadows crept up  along the mountain sides.
  Hans struggled on.
  The sun was sinking, but  its descent seemed to bring no coolness; the leaden height of the dead  air pressed upon his brow and heart, but the goal was near.
  He saw the  cataract of the Golden River springing from the hillside scarcely five  hundred feet above him.
  He paused for a moment to breathe, and sprang  on to complete his task.
    At this instant a faint cry fell on his ear.
  He turned, and saw a  gray-haired old man extended on the rocks.
  His eyes were sunk, his  features deadly pale and gathered into an expression of despair.
  "Water!" he stretched his arms to Hans, and cried feebly, "Water! I am  dying.
"    "I have none," replied Hans; "thou hast had thy share of life.
" He  strode over the prostrate body and darted on.
  And a flash of blue  lightning rose out of the East, shaped like a sword; it shook thrice  over the whole heaven and left it dark with one heavy, impenetrable  shade.
  The sun was setting; it plunged towards the horizon like a  redhot ball.
 The roar of the Golden River rose on Hans's ear.
  He stood  at the brink of the chasm through which it ran.
  Its waves were filled  with the red glory of the sunset; they shook their crests like tongues  of fire, and flashes of bloody light gleamed along their foam.
  Their  sound came mightier and mightier on his senses; his brain grew giddy  with the prolonged thunder.
  Shuddering he drew the flask from his  girdle and hurled it into the center of the torrent.
  As he did so, an  icy chill shot through his limbs; he staggered, shrieked, and fell.
  The waters closed over his cry, and the moaning of the river rose  wildly into the night as it gushed over    THE BLACK STONE              HOW MR.
 SCHWARTZ SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW  HE PROSPERED THEREIN      Poor little Gluck waited very anxiously, alone in the house, for Hans's  return.
  Finding he did not come back, he was terribly frightened and  went and told Schwartz in the prison all that had happened.
  Then  Schwartz was very much pleased and said that Hans must certainly have  been turned into a black stone and he should have all the gold to  himself.
  But Gluck was very sorry and cried all night.
  When he got up  in the morning there was no bread in the house, nor any money; so Gluck  went and hired himself to another goldsmith, and he worked so hard and  so neatly and so long every day that he soon got money enough together  to pay his brother's fine, and he went and gave it all to Schwartz, and  Schwartz got out of prison.
  Then Schwartz was quite pleased and said  he should have some of the gold of the river.
  But Gluck only begged he  would go and see what had become of Hans.
    Now when Schwartz had heard that Hans had stolen the holy water, he  thought to himself that such a proceeding might not be considered  altogether correct by the King of the Golden River, and determined to  manage matters better.
  So he took some more of Gluck's money and went  to a bad priest, who gave him some holy water very readily for it.
  Then Schwartz was sure it was all quite right.
 So Schwartz got up early  in the morning before the sun rose, and took some bread and wine in a  basket, and put his holy water in a flask, and set off for the  mountains.
  Like his brother he was much surprised at the sight of the  glacier and had great difficulty in crossing it, even after leaving his  basket behind him.
  The day was cloudless but not bright; there was a  heavy purple haze hanging over the sky, and the hills looked lowering  and gloomy.
  And as Schwartz climbed the steep rock path the thirst  came upon him, as it had upon his brother, until he lifted his flask to  his lips to drink.
  Then he saw the fair child lying near him on the  rocks, and it cried to him and moaned for water.
  "Water, indeed," said  Schwartz; "I haven't half enough for myself," and passed on.
  And as he  went he thought the sunbeams grew more dim, and he saw a low bank of  black cloud rising out of the west; and when he had climbed for another  hour, the thirst overcame him again and he would have drunk.
  Then he  saw the old man lying before him on the path, and heard him cry out for  water.
  "Water, indeed," said Schwartz; "I haven't half enough for  myself," and on he went.
  Then again the light seemed to fade from  before his eyes, and he looked up, and, behold, a mist, of the color of  blood, had come over the sun; and the bank of black cloud had risen  very high, and its edges were tossing and tumbling like the waves of  the angry sea and they cast long shadows which flickered over  Schwartz's path.
    Then Schwartz climbed for another hour, and again his thirst returned;  and as he lifted his flask to his lips he thought he saw his brother  Hans lying exhausted on the path before him, and as he gazed the figure  stretched its arms to him and cried for water.
 "Ha, ha!" laughed  Schwartz, "are you there? Remember the prison bars, my boy.
  Water,  indeed! do you suppose I carried it all the way up here for you?"  And  he strode over the figure; yet, as he passed, he thought he saw a  strange expression of mockery about its lips.
  And when he had gone a  few yards farther, he looked back; but the figure was not there.
    And a sudden horror came over Schwartz, he knew not why; but the thirst  for gold prevailed over his fear, and he rushed on.
  And the bank of  black cloud rose to the zenith, and out of it came bursts of spiry  lightning, and waves of darkness seemed to heave and float, between  their flashes, over the whole heavens.
  And the sky where the sun was  setting was all level and like a lake of blood; and a strong wind came  out of that sky, tearing its crimson clouds into fragments and  scattering them far into the darkness.
  And when Schwartz stood by the  brink of the Golden River, its waves were black like thunder clouds,  but their foam was like fire; and the roar of the waters below and the  thunder above met as he cast the flask into the stream.
  And as he did  so the lightning glared in his eyes, and the earth gave way beneath  him, and the waters closed over his cry.
  And the moaning of the river  rose wildly into the night as it gushed over the    TWO BLACK STONES              HOW LITTLE GLUCK SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW  HE PROSPERED THEREIN, WITH OTHER MATTERS OF INTEREST      When Gluck found that Schwartz did not come back, he was very sorry and  did not know what to do.
  He had no money and was obliged to go and  hire himself again to the goldsmith, who worked him very hard and gave  him very little money.
  So, after a month or two, Gluck grew tired and  made up his mind to go and try his fortune with the Golden River.
  "The  little king looked very kind," thought he.
 "I don't think he will turn  me into a black stone.
"  So he went to the priest, and the priest gave  him some holy water as soon as he asked for it.
  Then Gluck took some  bread in his basket, and the bottle of water, and set off very early  for the mountains.
    If the glacier had occasioned a great deal of fatigue in his brothers,  it was twenty times worse for him, who was neither so strong nor so  practiced on the mountains.
  He had several very bad falls, lost his  basket and bread, and was very much frightened at the strange noises  under the ice.
  He lay a long time to rest on the grass, after he had  got over, and began to climb the hill just in the hottest part of the  day.
  When he had climbed for an hour, he got dreadfully thirsty and  was going to drink like his brothers, when he saw an old man coming  down the path above him, looking very feeble and leaning on a staff.
  "Why son," said the old man, "I am faint with thirst; give me some of  that water.
"  Then Gluck looked at him, and when he saw that he was  pale and weary, he gave him the water.
  "Only pray don't drink it all,"  said Gluck.
  But the old man drank a great deal and gave him back the  bottle two thirds empty.
  Then he bade him good speed, and Gluck went  on again merrily.
  And the path became easier to his feet, and two or  three blades of grass appeared upon it, and some grasshoppers began  singing on the bank beside it, and Gluck thought he had never heard  such merry singing.
    Then he went on for another hour, and the thirst increased on him so  that he thought he should be forced to drink.
  But as he raised the  flask he saw a little child lying panting by the roadside, and it cried  out piteously for water.
  Then Gluck struggled with himself and  determined to bear the thirst a little longer; and he put the bottle to  the child's lips, and it drank it all but a few drops.
  Then it smiled  on him and got up and ran down the hill; and Gluck looked after it till  it became as small as a little star, and then turned and began climbing  again.
  And then there were all kinds of sweet flowers growing on the  rocks--bright green moss with pale pink, starry flowers, and soft  belled gentians, more blue than the sky at its deepest, and pure white  transparent lilies.
  And crimson and purple butterflies darted hither  and thither, and the sky sent down such pure light that Gluck had never  felt so happy in his life.
    Yet, when he had climbed for another hour, his thirst became  intolerable again; and when he looked at his bottle, he saw that there  were only five or six drops left in it, and he could not venture to  drink.
  And as he was hanging the flask to his belt again, he saw a  little dog lying on the rocks, gasping for breath--just as Hans had  seen it on the day of his ascent.
  And Gluck stopped and looked at it,  and then at the Golden River, not five hundred yards above him; and he  thought of the dwarf's words, that no one could succeed except in his  first attempt; and he tried to pass the dog, but it whined piteously  and Gluck stopped again.
 "Poor beastie," said Gluck, "it'll be dead  when I come down again, if I don't help it.
"  Then he looked closer and  closer at it, and its eye turned on him so mournfully that he could not  stand it.
  "Confound the king and his gold too," said Gluck, and he  opened the flask and poured all the water into the dog's mouth.
    The dog sprang up and stood on its hind legs.
  Its tail disappeared;  its ears became long, longer, silky, golden; its nose became very red;  its eyes became very twinkling; in three seconds the dog was gone, and  before Gluck stood his old acquaintance, the King of the Golden River.
    "Thank you," said the monarch.
  "But don't be frightened; it's all  right"--for Gluck showed manifest symptoms of consternation at this  unlooked-for reply to his last observation.
 "Why didn't you come  before," continued the dwarf, "instead of sending me those rascally  brothers of yours, for me to have the trouble of turning into stones?  Very hard stones they make, too.
"    "O dear me!" said Gluck, "have you really been so cruel?"    "Cruel!" said the dwarf; "they poured unholy water into my stream.
  Do  you suppose I'm going to allow that?"    "Why," said Gluck, "I am sure, sir,--your Majesty, I mean,--they got  the water out of the church font.
"    "Very probably," replied the dwarf, "but" (and his countenance grew  stern as he spoke) "the water which has been refused to the cry of the  weary and dying is unholy, though it had been blessed by every saint in  heaven; and the water which is found in the vessel of mercy is holy,  though it had been defiled with corpses.
"    So saying, the dwarf stooped and plucked a lily that grew at his feet.
  On its white leaves there hung three drops of clear dew.
 And the dwarf  shook them into the flask which Gluck held in his hand.
 "Cast these  into the river," he said, "and descend on the other side of the  mountains into the Treasure Valley.
  And so good speed.
"    As he spoke the figure of the dwarf became indistinct.
  The playing  colors of his robe formed themselves into a prismatic mist of dewy  light; he stood for an instant veiled with them as with the belt of a  broad rainbow.
  The colors grew faint; the mist rose into the air; the  monarch had evaporated.
    And Gluck climbed to the brink of the Golden River, and its waves were  as clear as crystal and as brilliant as the sun.
  And when he cast the  three drops of dew into the stream, there opened where they fell a  small, circular whirlpool, into which the waters descended with a  musical noise.
    Gluck stood watching it for some time, very much disappointed, because  not only the river was not turned into gold, but its waters seemed much  diminished in quantity.
  Yet he obeyed his friend the dwarf and  descended the other side of the mountains towards the Treasure Valley;  and as he went he thought he heard the noise of water working its way  under the ground.
  And when he came in sight of the Treasure Valley,  behold, a river, like the Golden River, was springing from a new cleft  of the rocks above it and was flowing in innumerable streams among the  dry heaps of red sand.
    And as Gluck gazed, fresh grass sprang beside the new streams, and  creeping plants grew and climbed among the moistening soil.
  Young  flowers opened suddenly along the riversides, as stars leap out when  twilight is deepening, and thickets of myrtle and tendrils of vine cast  lengthening shadows over the valley as they grew.
  And thus the  Treasure Valley became a garden again, and the inheritance which had  been lost by cruelty was regained by love.
    And Gluck went and dwelt in the valley, and the poor were never driven  from his door, so that his barns became full of corn and his house of  treasure.
  And for him the river had, according to the dwarf's promise,  become a river of gold.
    And to this day the inhabitants of the valley point out the place where  the three drops of holy dew were cast into the stream, and trace the  course of the Golden River under the ground until it emerges in the  Treasure Valley.
  And at the top of the cataract of the Golden River  are still to be seen two black stones, round which the waters howl  mournfully every day at sunset; and these stones are still called by  the people of the valley    THE BLACK BROTHERS                  .
                   SOMEBODY'S LITTLE GIRL    by Martha Young        Dedication      To    Two Little Elizabeths:    Elizabeth Young    and    Elizabeth Magruder          SOMEBODY'S LITTLE GIRL      If I were just to tell the things that Bessie Bell remembered I should  tell you some very strange things.
  Bessie Bell did not know whether  she remembered them, or just knew them, or whether they just grew,  those strange things in some strange country that never was anywhere in  the world; for when Bessie Bell tried to tell about those strange  things great grown wise people said: "No, no, Bessie Bell, there is  nothing in the world like that.
"    So Bessie Bell just remembered and wondered.
    She remembered how somewhere, sometime, there was a window where you  could look out and see everything green, little and green, and always  changing and moving, away, away--beyond everything little, and green,  and moving all the time.
  But great grown wise folks said: "No, there  is no window in all the world like that.
"    And once when some one gave Bessie Bell a little round red apple she  caught her breath very quickly and her little heart jumped and then  thumped very loudly (that is the way it seemed to her) and she  remembered: Little apple trees all just alike, and little apple trees  in rows all just alike on top of those and again on top of those until  they came to a great row of big round red apples on top of all.
    Rut great grown people said: "No, no, Bessie Bell, there are no apple  trees in all the world like that.
"    And one time Bessie Bell was at a pretty house and somebody sat her on  a little low chair and said: "Keep still, Bessie Bell.
"    She kept still so long that at last she began to be afraid to move at  all, and she got afraid even to crook up her little finger for fear it  would pop off loud,--she had kept still so long that all her round  little fingers and her round little legs felt so stiff.
    Then one, great grown person said: "She seems a very quiet child.
" And  the other said: "She is a very quiet child--sometimes.
"    But just then Bessie Bell turned her head, and though her round little  neck felt stiff it did not pop!--and she saw--something in a corner  that was blue, green, and brown, and soft, and she forgot how afraid to  move she was, and she forgot how stiff she thought she was, and she  forgot how still she was told to be, and she jumped up and ran to the  corner and cried out: "Pretty! Pretty! Pretty!"    One grown person took up the Thing that was blue, and green, and brown,  and soft, and waved it to and fro, to and fro in front of Bessie Bell.
    And Bessie Bell clapped her hands, and jumped for joy, and laughed, and  cried: "Boo! boo! boo!"    And Bessie Bell ran right into the Thing that was blue, and green, and  brown, and soft, and she threw out her round little arms and clasped  them about the Thing that was blue, and green, and brown, and soft!    And she pulled it over her face, and she laughed and cried for  joy--because she remembered--    But the great grown person who had brought Bessie Bell to the pretty  house said: "Oh, Bessie Bell! Why, Bessie Bell!  For shame, Bessie  Bell!  How could you do so to the beautiful peacock-feather-fly-brush!"    So Bessie Bell could only cry--and that very softly--and feel ashamed  as she was bid, and forget what it was that she remembered.
    Bessie Bell might have remembered one time when a great house was all  desolate, and when nobody or nothing at all breathed in the whole great  big house, but one little tiny girl and one great big white cat, with  just one black spot on its tail.
    The nurse that always had played so nicely with the tiny little girl  was lying with her cheek in her hand over yonder.
    The Grandmother who had always talked so much to the tiny little girl  was not talking any more.
    The tiny little girl was so sick that she only just could breathe  quickly, just so--and just so--.
    If Bessie Bell could remember that, it was only that she remembered the  big white cat like a big soft dream.
  And she might have remembered  how, now and then, the big cat put out a paw and touched the little  girl's cheek, like a soft white dream-touch.
    And that little girl had on a night-gown that was long, and soft, and  white, and on that little white night-gown was worked, oh so carefully,  in linen thread: "Bessie Bell.
"    Then the few people who walked about the world in Fever-time came in to  that big house, and they took up that little tiny girl that breathed so  softly and so quickly--just so!    And they read on her little white night-gown the words written with the  linen thread: "Bessie Bell.
"    And they said: "Let us take this little girl with us.
"    They put a big soft white blanket around the little girl and walked out  of the big house with her, someone carrying her in strong arms.
    And the big white cat got down off the big white bed and rubbed himself  against the bedpost, and went round and round the bed-post, and rubbed  himself round and round the bed-post.
    And the tiny little girl never saw the big house, or the big soft white  cat any more.
    And now when it happened that she remembered something, great grown  people said: "No, no, Bessie Bell, there is nothing in the world like  that.
"    So she just wondered and remembered, and almost forgot what it was that  she did remember.
                       Sister Mary Felice had all the little tiny girls playing in the sand:  that was the place that was meant for the little girls to play in.
    All the little girls had on blue checked aprons.
  All the aprons had  straps and buttons behind.
    For just one hour every day all the little tiny girls played in the  sand, and while they played Sister Mary Felice sat on a willow-wrought  bench and watched them play.
    Then when that hour was exactly passed Sister Angela always came with a  basket of netted canes, an Indian basket, on her arm.
  In the Indian  basket were little cakes--such nice little cakes--always they had  caraway seeds in them.
    One day Sister Mary Felice said: "Sister Angela, did Sister Ignatius  put too many caraway seeds in the cakes this time?"    Sister Angela said: "I think not, Sister Mary Felice.
  Will you try  one?"    Sister Mary Felice said: "I thank you, Sister Angela.
"    Then Sister Mary Felice took one to try.
    Then always Sister Angela, with the Indian basket on her arm, took all  the little girls to the long back gallery that was latticed in.
    On a low shelf close against the lattice sat a row of white basins.
    Then all the little tiny girls washed their little tiny hands in the  white basins.
  And while they washed their little tiny hands by twos  and by threes together, two little girls washing their hands in one  basin together, three little girls washing their hands together, they  all oftentimes laughed together and said:      "Wash together!    And be friends forever!    Wash together!    And be friends forever!"    Then Sister Angela held a long pink checked towel in her hands while  the little tiny girls came as their tiny hands were washed and wiped  them on the pink checked towel.
    Then if two little girls took hold of the pink checked towel at once  they both laughed and sang:      "Don't wipe together,    Or we'll fight    Before night.
"    And the other little girls that were still washing their hands in the  white basins on the low shelf by the back-gallery lattice sang over and  over again:      "Wash together! We'll wash together!    And we'll be happy forever!"    When all the pink clean tiny hands were wiped dry, or as nearly dry as  little girls do wipe tiny pink hands, on the pink checked towel held  for them by Sister Angela, then Sister Angela hung the pink checked  towel on the lowest limb of the arbor-vita tree.
  Then the little girls  all ran to sit down in a row on the lowest step of the back gallery,  with their little feet on the gravel below.
  Sister Angela walked the  length of the row, and gave to each little girl in the row a sweet tiny  cake, or maybe Sister Angela walked twice down the row and gave to each  little girl two cakes, or sometimes maybe she walked three times down  the row, and then each little girl had three cakes; but no one little  girl ever had more than every other little girl.
    Always Sister Angela sat a little way off from the row of the little  girls.
  She always sat on a bench under the great magnolia-tree and  watched the tiny girls as they ate their tiny cakes.
    And always the pink checked towel waved itself ever so softly to and  fro on the lowest limb of the arbor-vitae-tree, for that was the way  that pink checked towels did to help to dry themselves after helping to  dry so many little pink fingers.
  Often, so often, little brown  sparrows came hopping to the gravel to pick up any tiny crumbs of cake  that the little girls dropped, but you may be sure that they did not  drop so very many, many little brown crumbs for little brown birds to  find.
    But if they were dropped, even if by rare chance were the crumbs so  large as to be nearly as large as half of a cake--why then, that crumb  had to stay for those little birds.
  It was the law! The law that the  little girls had made for themselves, and nobody but themselves knew  about that law--for the good of the birds.
  But no little girl cared to  disobey that law of their own that nobody but themselves knew about,  for if one had--how dreadful it would have been--no little girl would  have played with her until--oh, so long, so long--until she might at  last have been forgiven!    So all the little brown crumbs that the tiny little girls did drop, why  the tiny little brown birds did pick up,--and they never said whether  they liked caraway seeds or not!                       One day when the tiny little girls were all in a row eating cakes,  Sister Angela, sitting on a bench under the magnolia, said quite  suddenly: "Good morning!"    She rose up from her seat under the great magnolia.
    Then the little brown birds fluttered up from the gravel.
    Then all the little girls looked up.
    There stood two pretty grown-up people.
    And these two grown-up people had no soft white around their faces like  the soft white around the face that Sister Angela wore, and they had no  black veils, soft and long like the black veil that Sister Angela wore.
  And they had no little white crosses like the small white cross that  Sister Angela wore on the breast of her soft black dress.
    One of the pretty-grown up folks looked at one of the little tiny girls  and said: "And what is her name?"    Sister Angela said: "Bessie Bell was written on her little white  night-gown, done in linen thread.
"    And Sister Angela said: "Yes, we have always kept the little white  night-gown.
"    And one of the pretty grown-up people said: "Yes, that was right.
  Always to keep the little white night-gown.
"    And the other grown-up person said: "And how comes that to be all that  you know?"    Sister Angela said: "Because of the fever.
"    And the pretty one said: "The dreadful fever!"    Sister Angela said: "Yes.
  The dreadful fever.
  It often leaves none in  a house, and even sometimes none in a whole neighborhood to tell the  story.
"    If, as Sister Angela and the pretty grown person talked, there came to  Bessie Bell any thought of a great silent house, and a big white cat,  with just one bit of black spot on its tail, why if such a thought came  to Bessie Bell it came only to float away, away like white thistle  seed--drifting away as dreams drift.
    When the two pretty grown ones had gone away, then Sister Angela had  nodded her head at the row of little girls, so that they might know  that they might go on eating their cakes, for of course the little  girls knew that they must hold their cakes in their hands and wait, and  not eat, when Sister Angela had shaken her head gently at them while  she talked to the two pretty ones.
  The little brown birds seemed to  know, too, that they could come back to the gravel to look for crumbs  again.
    Then, as the little girls were again eating their cakes, one little  girl said: "Sister Angela, were they Sisters?"    Sister Angela said: "No, they are not Sisters.
"    Then another little girl asked: "Sister Angela, what were they, then?"    Sister Angela said: "They are only just ladies.
"    Then always after that Bessie Bell and the other little girls were glad  when Only-Just-Ladies came to see them.
    The sun shone nearly always, or it seemed to the little girls that it  nearly always shone, out in that large garden where they could play the  hour in the sand, and where they could spend one hour eating their  cakes with their feet on the gravel, and where they could walk behind  Sister Justina on all the shell-bordered walks around the beds (but  they must not step on the beds)--just one hour.
  If a rain came it  always did surprise them: those little girls were always surprised when  it rained!  and they did not know exactly what to do when it rained,  though they knew almost always what to do when the sun shone.
  One day  when it rained it happened that the little girls were all left over the  one hour in the long room where all the rows and rows of the little  arm-chairs sat, and where all the little girls learned to Count, and to  say Their Prayers, and to Tell the Time, and to sing "Angels Bright,"  and to know the A B C blocks.
  Sister Theckla, who always stayed the  one hour in that room, had gone to say to the Sisters that the one hour  was over, and that it was raining, and what must the little girls do  now?    While Sister Theckla was gone, all the little girls went to the  windows, and all the tiny girls looked at the rain coming down, coming  down in drops, so many drops; and so fast the drops came that they  seemed to come in long strings of drops straight from the sky.
    Then one little girl laughed and began to beat on the window by which  she stood, to beat all over it as far as her little damp pink fingers  could reach, and to say:      "Rain! Rain!    Go to Spain!    Rain! Rain!    Go to Spain!    Rain! Rain!    Go to Spain!"    And all the little girls thought that was so beautiful that they began  to beat all over the windows, too, just as high and just as far as  their little damp pink fingers could reach, and to sing as loud and as  gaily as they could sing:      "Rain! Rain!    Go to Spain!"    Sister Theckla and Sister Angela came to the door of the room,--and  they were so astonished that they could only look at one another and  say to one another: "What do they mean?  Where did they learn that?"    And the little girl who had taught the other little girls that much of  the song remembered some more; and so she beat louder than ever on the  window pane and said:      "Rain, rain, rain,    Go away!    And come another day!"    All the little girls laughed more than ever and sang louder than ever:      "Rain, rain, rain,    Go away!    Come again another day!"    Then Sister Angela looked at Sister Theckla and said: "Where did the  child learn that, do you suppose?"    And Sister Theckla said: "She is older than the others.
  She must have  learned it at home!"    And Sister Angela and Sister Theckla came into the room and they said:  "See, now, what you have done to the windows!"    Sure enough, when the little girls looked at the windows the glass was  all dim and blurred with little damp finger-prints!                       It was one day as the sun shone as it did shine most days, that the  same little girl who knew how to sing that song when it rained was  running on the shell-bordered walk, holding Bessie Bell's hand and  running, when her little foot tripped up against Bessie Bell's  foot,--and over Bessie Bell rolled on the walk with the shell border.
    Then Bessie Bell cried and cried.
    And Sister Mary Felice said: "Bessie Bell, where are you hurt?"    Bessie Bell did not know where she was hurt: she only knew that she was  so sorry to have been so happy to be running, and then to roll so  suddenly on the walk.
    Then the little girl said: "She isn't hurt at all.
  She is just crying.
"    Sister Mary Felice said: "But you threw her down.
  You must tell her  you are sorry.
"    Then the little girl said: "But I didn't mean to throw her down.
"    "But," Sister Mary Felice said, "you did trip her up, and you must beg  her pardon.
"    Then Sister Theckla came to take all the little girls to the room where  so many chairs sat in so many rows, and she too said: "Yes, you must  beg her pardon.
"    Bessie Bell was listening so that she had almost stopped crying, but  now when Sister Story Felice and Sister Theckla both said to the little  girl, "Yes, you must beg pardon," then the little girl began to cry,  too.
    Then Bessie Bell grew so sorry again, she hardly knew why, or for what,  that she began to cry again.
    So then both Sisters said again: "Yes, you should beg pardon.
"    But the little girl still cried, and said, "But I didn't mean to trip  her.
"  Then she shook her head at Bessie Bell and said--because she  just had to say it:      "I beg your pardon!    Grant me grace!    I hope the cat will scratch your face!"    Oh! Sister Mary Felice looked at Sister Theckla, and Sister Theckla  looked at Sister Mary Felice--and they both said: "Where did she learn  that?"    But Bessie Bell knew that the little girl did not mean to throw her  down, so she said, "No, you didn't mean to do it.
"    She had thought she ought to say that, and she had been getting ready  to say that before the little girl had been made to beg her pardon, and  now that she had gotten ready she said: "No, you didn't mean to do it.
"    Then the little girl stopped crying, too, and ran and caught Bessie  Bell's hand again and said to her again:      "I beg your pardon!    Grant me grace!   I hope the cat won't scratch your face!"    So they went skipping down the walk together just as they had gone  before.
  Then Sister Mary Felice and Sister Theckla both said: "Well!  Well!"                       One time it came about that Bessie Bell lay a long time in her little  white crib-bed, and she did not know why, and she did not care much  why.
  She did not get up and play in the sand while Sister Mary Felice  looked one hour at the little girls playing in the sand.
    She scarcely wondered why she did not leave the crib-bed to sit on the  long gallery-step in a row with all the other little girls, all with  their feet on the gravel, and all eating the tiny cakes that Sister  Ignatius made, while Sister Angela sat on the bench under the  magnolia-tree and looked at the row of little girls.
    If sometimes just at waking from fitful sleep in her crib-bed there  came to her just a thought, or a remembrance, of a great big soft white  cat that reached its paw out and softly touched her cheek, it came to  her only like the touch of fancy in a big soft white dream.
    Often Only-Just-Ladies came and talked over her little white crib with  Sister Helen Vincula.
    Bessie Bell's little fingers were no longer pink and round now; they  lay just white, so white and small, on the white spread.
  And Bessie  Bell did not mind how quiet she was told to be, for she was too tired  to want to make any noise at all.
    One day it happened that an Only-Just-Lady came and said: "Sister Helen  Vincula, I want to give you a ticket to carry you away to the high  mountain, and I want you to go to stay a month in my house on the  mountain, and I want you to carry this little sick girl with you.
  And  when you are there, Sister Helen Vincula, my bread-man will bring you  bread, and my milk-man will bring you milk, and my market-man from the  cove will bring you apples and eggs, and all the rest of the good  things that come up the mountain from the warm caves.
"    "For," the Only-Just-Lady said, "I want this little sick girl to grow  well again, and I want her little arms and legs and fingers to get  round and pink again.
"    Bessie Bell thought that that was a very pretty tale that the Lady was  telling, but she did not know or understand that that tale was about  her.
  Then the Only-Just-Lady said, "Sister Helen Vincula, it will do  you good, too, as well as this little girl to stay in the high  mountains.
"    Not until all of Bessie Bell's little blue checked aprons, and all of  her little blue dresses, and all of her little white petticoats, and  all of her little white night-gowns, and even the tiny old night-gown  with the linen thread name worked on it, had been put with all the rest  of her small belongings into the old trunk with brass tacks in the  leather, the old, old trunk that had belonged to Sister Helen Vincula,  did Bessie Bell know that it was herself, little Bessie Bell, who was  going away Somewhere.
                       It was a very strange new world to Bessie Bell, that new world up on  the High Mountain.
    She did not think the grand views off the edge of the high mountain so  strange.
  But she loved to look out on those views as she stood by  Sister Helen Vincula on the gray cliff; Sister Helen Vincula holding  her hand very fast while they both looked down into the valleys and  coves.
  As the shadows of evening crept up to the cliff whereon they  stood, and as those shadows folded round and round the points and  coves, those points and caves lying below and beyond fold over fold,  everything grew purple and violet.
    Everything grew so purple, and so violet, and so great, and so wide  that it seemed sometimes to the little girl, standing on the cliff by  Sister Helen Vincula, that she was looking right down into the heart of  a violet as great, as wide--as great, as wide--as the whole world.
    But this did not seem so strange to Bessie Bell, for she yet remembered  that window out of which one could see just small, green, moving  things, and of which great grown people had told her, "No, Bessie Bell,  there is no such window in all the world.
"    So in her own way she thought that maybe after awhile that the big, big  violet might drift away, away, and great grown people might say, "No,  Bessie Bell, there never was a violet in all the world like that.
"    It was the people--and all the people--of that new world that seemed so  strange to Bessie Bell.
    There were children, and children in all the summer cabins on that high  mountain.
    And those children did not walk in rows.
    And those children did not do things by one hours.
    And those children did not wash their hands in little white basins  sitting in rows on long back gallery benches.
    It was strange to Bessie Bell that those children did not sit in rows  to eat tiny cakes with caraway seeds in them while Sister Angela sat on  the bench under the great magnolia-tree and looked at the row of little  girls.
    It was so very strange to Bessie Bell that these children wore all  sorts of clothes--all sorts! Not just blue dresses, and blue checked  aprons.
    And Bessie Bell knew, too, that those little girls in all sorts of  clothes could not float away into that strange country of No-where and  Never-was, where, too, the things that she remembered seemed to drift  away--and to so nearly get lost, living only in dimming memory.
    These little girls in all sorts of clothes were real, and sure-enough,  and nobody could ever say of them, "There are no such little girls in  the world," because sometimes when Bessie Bell would get to thinking,  and thinking about the strangeness of them, she would almost wonder if  she did not just remember them.
  When she would give one just a little  pinch to see if that one was a real sure-enough little girl, why that  little girl would say, "Don't.
" She would say "Don't!" just the same as  a little girl in the row of little girls all with blue checked aprons  would say "Don't," if you pinched one of them ever so little.
    There were no Sisters on that high mountain.
  Sister Helen Vincula was  the only Sister there.
  That seemed very strange to Bessie Bell.
    One day the strangest thing of all so far happened.
    One little girl called another little girl with whom she was playing,  "Sister.
"    Bessie Bell laughed at that.
    "Oh, she is not a Sister!" said Bessie Bell.
    "Yes, she is; she is my sister!" said the little girl.
    "No," said Bessie Bell, just as great grown people said to her when she  remembered strange things, "No, there never was in the world a Sister  like that!"    Then the smaller of the little girls who were playing together ran to  the larger one, and caught hold of her hand, and they stood together in  front of Bessie Bell--they both had long black curls, but Bessie Bell  had short golden curls--and the smaller girl said: "Yes, she is my  sister!"    And the larger girl said: "Yes, she is, too.
  She is  my-own-dear-sister!"    The smaller little girl shook her black curls and said: "She is my  own-dear-owny-downy-dear-sister!"    In all of her life Bessie Bell had never heard anything like that.
    And all the other little girls who were playing joined in and said:  "Bessie Bell doesn't know what she is talking about.
  Of course you are  sisters.
  Everybody knows you are sisters!"    Bessie Bell was distressed to be told that she did not know what she  was talking about--and she knew so much about Sisters.
    So she began to cry, very softly.
    Then she stopped crying long enough to say: "But I never saw Sisters  like that before!"    Then she took up her crying again right where she left off.
    Then a little boy--but he seemed a very large boy to Bessie Bell with  his long-striped-stocking-legs--said to Bessie Bell: "No, Bessie Bell,  they are not Sisters like Sister Helen Vincula and the Sisters that you  know, but they are just what they say they are--just own dear sisters.
"    Then came to Bessie Bell that knowledge that we are often times slow in  getting: she knew all of a sudden--that she did not know everything.
  She did not know all, even about Sisters.
    Because, in all that she knew or remembered or wondered about, there  was nothing at all about that strange thing that all the little  children, but herself, knew so well about--"Own-dear-sisters.
"    Another strange thing came into her mind, brought into her mind partly  by her ears, but mostly by her eyes: There were not in this new world  on the high mountain--perhaps there were not after all so many anywhere  as she had thought--there were not so many Sisters like Sister Helen  Vincula (for was not Sister Helen Vincula the only Sister she had seen  on the mountain?).
  There were not after all so many Sisters like  Sister Angela; and Sister Mary Felice, who watched the little  blue-checked-apron girls playing in the sand; and Sister Ignatius, who  cooked the cakes with the caraway seeds in them; and Sister Theckla,  who taught the little girls to Count and to Sing.
    Why, the whole world, surely the up-on-the mountain-world, seemed full  of Only-Just-Ladies.
    Not just a Lady here and there, coming to visit with hats on, to talk a  little to the Sisters, to look at the little girls with blue checked  aprons on.
  But here they were coming and going all the time, moving  about, and living in the cabins, walking everywhere with or without  hats on, standing on the gray cliffs, and looking down--maybe into the  heart of a worldwide violet there, off the edge of the cliff, such as  Bessie Bell saw or fancied she saw.
    So many Ladies.
    Bessie Bell leaned against the little fluted post of the gallery to the  cabin that she and Sister Helen Vincula lived in, and decided to  herself that, strange as it was, yet was it true that the whole world  was full of--Ladies.
    There were yet stranger things for Bessie Bell to learn.
    She had not for long played with those many little girls in all sorts  of clothes, and with larger girls, and with boys,--some with  short-striped-stocking-legs and some with  long-striped-stocking-legs,--before she heard one child say: "Mama says  she will take me to Sweet Fern Cave to-morrow.
"    Or perhaps it was another child who said: "Mama won't let me wade in  the branch.
"    Or another child said: "Mama says I can have a party for all the little  girls and boys on the mountain next Friday!"    Then another little child said: "My Mama has made me a beautiful pink  dress, and I will wear that to your party.
"    Mama?  My Mama?    Bessie Bell leaned against the little fluted post of the gallery to the  cabin where she and Sister Helen Vincula lived, and thought a great  deal about that.
    And Bessie Bell wondered a great deal what that could mean: Mama?  My  Mama?    There were strange new things in this world.
    Bessie Bell almost forgot to remember now, because every day was so  full of such strange new things to know.
    Mama?  My Mama?    Bessie Bell did a great deal of thinking about that.
    One day the little children were playing at building rock chimneys.
    There was not much sand there for little children to play in, so that  the children often built rock chimneys, and rock tables, and rock  fences.
    As they were playing one little girl suddenly left the playground and  ran, calling: "Mama! Mama! Come here; come this way, and see the  chimney we have built!"    Bessie Bell turned quickly from play and looked after the little girl  who was running across the playground to where three ladies were  standing.
    The little girl caught the dress of one of the ladies, and came pulling  at her dress and bringing her across the ground to see the stone  chimney, and the little girl kept saying:    "Look, Mama! See, Mama! Isn't it a grand chimney? Won't it 'most hold  smoke?"    Bessie Bell stood still with her little hands--they were beginning to  be round pink little hands again, now--clasped in front of her and  wondered.
    "See, Mama! Look, Mama!" cried the little girl.
    "Why does she say: Mama?" asked Bessie Bell, because she just wondered,  and wondered--and she did not know.
    "Because it is her Mama," said a child who had just brought two more  rocks to put on the chimney.
    "Oh," said Bessie Bell.
    That lady who was the little girl's Mama looked much as all the ladies  looked.
    "Are all Ladies Mamas?" asked Bessie Bell.
    She hoped the child who had brought the two rocks would not laugh, for  Bessie Bell knew she would cry if she did.
    The little girl did not laugh at all.
  She was trying so carefully to  put the last rock on top of the stone chimney, she said: "No, Bessie  Bell: some are Mamas, and some are only just Ladies.
"    There.
  There it was again: Only-Just-Ladies.
    Bessie Bell wondered how to tell which were Mamas, and which were  Ladies--just Ladies.
    Very often after that day she watched those who passed the cabin where  she and Sister Helen Vincula lived, and wondered which were Mamas--    And which were Ladies.
    There was no rule of old or young by which Bessie Bell could tell.
    Nor was it as one could tell Sisters from Just-Ladies by a way of  dress.
  For Sisters, like Sister Helen Vincula, wore a soft white  around the face, and soft long black veils, and a small cross on the  breast of the dress: so that even had any not known the difference one  could easily have guessed.
    But for Ladies and Mamas there were none of these differences.
    But Bessie Bell looked and looked and wondered, but her eyes brought to  her no way of knowing.
    Bessie Bell could at length think of only one way to find out the  difference, and that was to ask--to let her ears help her eyes to bring  to her some way of knowing.
    One day, a dear old lady with white curls all around under her bonnet  stopped near the playground and called Bessie Bell to her and gave her  some chocolate candy, every piece of candy folded up in its own white  paper.
    Bessie Bell said: "Thank you, ma'am.
"    Then as the lady still stood by the playground Bessie Bell asked her:  "Are you a Lady, ma'am?"    "I have been called so," said the lady, smiling down at Bessie Bell.
    "Or are you a Mama?" asked Bessie Bell.
    "Ah," said the lady; "I am a Mama, too, but all my little girls have  grown up and left me.
"    Bessie Bell wondered how they could have done that, those little girls.
  But she saw, and was so glad to see, that this lady was very wise, and  that she understood all the things that little girls wonder about.
    But though there was a difference, a very great difference, between  Mamas and Ladies it was very hard to tell--unless you asked.
    One day a large fat lady took Bessie Bell on her lap.
  That was very  strange to Bessie Bell--to sit on top of anybody.
    And the lady made a rabbit, and a pony, and a preacher, all out of a  handkerchief and her nice fat fingers.
  And then she made with the same  handkerchief and fingers a Mama holding a Baby.
    Then Bessie Bell looked up at her with her wondering eyes and asked:  "Are you a Lady--"    "Bless my soul!" cried the lady.
 "Do you hear this child?  And now,  come to think of it, I don't know whether I am a lady or not--"    And the lady laughed until Bessie Bell felt quite shaken up.
    "Or are you a Mama?" asked Bessie Bell, when it seemed that the lady  was about to stop laughing.
    "So that is it?" asked the lady, and she seemed about to begin laughing  again.
    "Yes, I am a Mama, and I have three little girls about as funny as you  are.
"    Another time a lady passed by the cabin where Bessie Bell stood leaning  against the little fluted white post of the gallery, and said:    "Good morning, Bessie Bell.
  I am Alice's Mama.
"    That made things so simple, thought Bessie Bell.
  This lady was a Mama.
  And she was Alice's Mama.
    Bessie Bell wished that all would tell in that nice way at once whether  they were Mamas or Just-Ladies.
    The next lady who passed by the cabin also stopped to talk to Bessie  Bell.
    And Bessie Bell asked: "Are you a Mama or Only-Just-A-Lady?"    "I am only just a lady," the lady said, patting Bessie Bell's little  tiny hand.
  And it was easy to see that, in Bessie Bell's mind, though  Only-Just-Ladies were kind and sweet, Mamas were far greater and more  important beings.
    One night, when Sister Helen Vincula had put Bessie Bell to bed in the  small bed that was not a crib-bed, though like that she had slept in  before she had come to the high mountain, Bessie Bell still lay wide  awake.
    Her blue eyes were wide open and both of her pink little hands were  above her head on the pillow.
  She was thinking, and thinking, and she  forgot that she was thinking her thinking aloud, and she said:    "Alice has a mama.
  Robbie has a mama.
  Katie has a mama.
  Where is  Bessie Bell's mama?  Never mind: Bessie Bell will find a mama.
"    Then Sister Helen Vincula, who was wide awake, too, said:    "Ah me, ah me.
"    Bessie Bell said: "Sister Helen Vincula, did you call me?"    Sister Helen Vincula said:    "No, child: go to sleep.
"                       The next day was the day for Sister Helen Vincula and Bessie Bell to  leave the high, cool mountain.
  They were to leave the little cabin  where the lady had told them to live until they had gotten well again.
    So when their leaving day came Sister Helen Vincula put a clean  stiff-starched blue-checked apron on Bessie Bell, and they walked  together to the Mall where the band was playing.
    Bessie Bell was always so glad when Sister Helen Vincula took her to  the Mall in the afternoon when the band played.
    All the little children went every afternoon in their prettiest dresses  to the Mall where the band played.
    Because in the afternoon the band played just the sort of music that  little girls liked to hear.
    Every afternoon all the nurses came to the Mall and brought all the  babies, and the nurses rolled the babies up and down the sawdust walks  in the pretty baby-carriages, with nice white, and pink, and blue  parasols over the babies' heads.
    That afternoon Sister Helen Vincula stayed a long time with Bessie  Bell, on the Mall, sitting by her on the stone bench and listening to  the gay music, and looking at the children in their prettiest clothes,  and at the nurses rolling the babies in the pretty carriages with the  beautiful pink, and white, and blue parasols over the babies' heads.
    Then Sister Helen Vincula said: "Bessie Bell, I am going across the  long bridge to see some ladies and to tell them Good-bye, because we  are going away tomorrow.
"    And Sister Helen Vincula said: "Now, will you stay right here on this  stone bench till I come back for you?"    Bessie Bell said, "Yes, Sister Helen Vincula.
"    So Sister Helen Vincula went away across the long bridge to see the  ladies and to tell them Good-bye.
    Bessie Bell did not know much about going away, and she did not  understand about it at all, so she did not care at all about it.
    She just sat on the stone bench with her little pink hands folded on  her blue checked apron, and looked at the children in their prettiest  clothes, and at the babies, and at the parasols.
    She loved so to look, and she loved so to listen to the pretty gay  music that she did not notice that a lady had come to the stone bench,  and had seated herself just where Sister Helen Vincula had sat before  she went to see the ladies and to tell them Good-bye.
    There were many other ladies on the Mall, and many ladies passed in  their walk by the stone bench where Bessie Bell and the lady sat.
    Everybody loved to come to the Mall in the afternoon when the band  played.
 Everybody loved to hear the gay music.
  Everybody loved to see  the children in their prettiest clothes, and to see all the nurses  rolling the babies in the carriages with the pretty parasols.
    And one of the ladies passing by looked over to the stone bench where  Bessie Bell sat with her hands folded on her blue checked apron, and  where the lady had seated herself just as Sister Helen Vincula had sat  before she went across the long bridge.
    And the lady said, as she passed by and looked: "Striking likeness.
"    Another lady with her said: "Wonderful!"    And another one with them said: "Impossible! But strange indeed--"    Bessie Bell did not notice what the ladies said, but because they  looked so attentively to where she sat on the stone bench her attention  was turned the way their eyes turned as they talked in low tones and  looked attentively passing by.
    So when they had passed by, Bessie Bell turned and looked to the other  end of the bench where the lady sat.
    Bessie Bell was so surprised at the first look that she hardly knew  what to think.
    The lady did not look like Sister Helen Vincula, oh, not at all; but  the veil that she wore was soft and black like that that Sister Helen  Vincula wore.
  The dress that the lady wore was black also, but it  looked as if it were stiff and very crisp, and not soft like the dress  that Sister Helen Vincula wore.
  Bessie Bell did not mean to be rude,  but she reached out one tiny hand and took hold of the lady's dress,  just a tiny pinch of it.
    Yes, it was very crisp.
    Then the lady turned and looked at Bessie Bell.
    Then Bessie Bell was still more surprised, for there was something  white under her veil.
  Not white all round the face like that Sister  Helen Vincula wore, but soft crinkly white just over the lady's soft  yellow hair.
    Also on the breast of her black dress was a cross, but not white like  the cross that Sister Helen Vincula wore.
  No, this cross was shining  very brightly, and it was very golden in the sunlight,--and--somehow,  somehow,--Bessie Bell knew just how that cross felt,--she knew without  feeling it.
  She did not have to feel it as she had felt the dress.
    Bessie Bell looked and thought.
  She thought this lady looked like a  Sister--and yet there was a difference.
  She looked also like  Just-A-Lady, and she also looked grand and important enough for a Mama.
    Bessie Bell looked and thought, but she could not tell just exactly  what this lady was.
    It was best that she should ask, and then she would surely know.
    So she asked: "Are you a Lady, ma'am?"    "I hope so, little girl," the lady said.
    "I thought, maybe, you were a Sister," said Bessie Bell.
    "No," said the lady.
    "Like Sister Mary Felice, and Sister Angela, and Sister Helen Vincula,"  said Bessie Bell.
    "No," said the lady.
    "Are you a Mama, then?" asked Bessie Bell.
    The lady looked as if she were going to cry.
    But Bessie Bell could see nothing to cry about.
  The band was still  playing ever so gaily, and all the little children looked so beautiful  and so happy, all playing and running hither and thither on the sawdust  walks, that it was good just to look at them.
    But on the instant Bessie Bell remembered how sorrowful it was to cry  when you could not understand things, so she quickly reached out her  little pink hand and laid it on the lady's hand--just because she knew  how sorrowful it felt to feel like crying and not to know.
    "You see," said Bessie Bell gently, as she softly patted the lady's  hand, "you see, you do look something like a Sister,--but," said Bessie  Bell, "I believe you do look more like a Mama.
"    "Little girl," said the lady, "what do you mean?"    And she still looked as if she might cry.
    "Yes," said Bessie Bell, for she had begun to think very hard, "Alice  has a mama.
  Robbie has a mama.
  Lucy has a mama.
  Everybody has a  mama.
  Never mind, Bessie Bell will find a mama--"    "Little girl," said the lady, "why do you say, Bessie Bell--?"    When the lady said that it seemed to Bessie Bell that she heard  something sweet--something away off beyond what the band was playing,  so she just clapped her hands and laughed out loud, and said over and  over as if it were a little song:    "Bessie Bell! Bessie, Bessie, Bessie Bell!"    But the lady at her side looked down at the child as if she were  afraid.
  Bessie Bell knew how sorrowful it was to be afraid, so she  stopped patting her hands and laughing,--for she didn't know why she  had begun to do it--and she laid her hand again on the lady's hand,  just because she knew how sorrowful it was to be afraid.
    But Bessie Bell could not see anything to be afraid of: the band was  playing just as gaily as ever, and the children, and the nurses, and  the babies, and the parasols were as gay as ever.
    "Where is your mama?" asked the lady, taking fast hold of the little  hand that patted her hand.
    "Everybody has a mama--never mind--"    "But where is your mama?" asked the lady again.
    Bessie Bell had begun to wonder and so had forgotten to answer.
    "Child, where is your mama?" said the lady again, still holding fast to  Bessie Bell's hand.
    "But--I don't know," said Bessie Bell.
    Then the lady looked as if she had begun to wonder, too, and she seemed  to be looking away off; away off, but how closely she held Bessie  Bell's hand--closer than Sister Angela, or Sister Theckla, or even  Sister Helen Vincula, or Sister Justina--    Then Bessie Bell began to wonder still more, and to remember, as the  lady held fast to her little fingers.
  She began to talk her thinking  out loud, and she said: "Yes, there was a window--where everything was  green, and, small, and moving--but Sister Justina said there was not  any window like that in the whole world--"    The lady held Bessie Bell's hand very hard, and she said--softly, as if  she, too, was talking her thinking aloud:    "Yes, there was a window like that in the world, for just outside the  nursery-window there grew a Pride of China Tree, and it filled all the  window with small, green, moving leaves--"    Then Bessie Bell just let the lady draw her up close, and she leaned up  against the lady.
    She felt so happy now, for she knew she had found the Wisest Woman in  the world, for this lady knew the things that little girls only could  remember.
  If she had thought about it she would have told the lady  about the tiny apple-trees with the very, very small apples on them,  and other rows of apple-trees over those, and other rows on top of  those, and on top of all a row of big round red apples.
    Then the lady might have said: Yes, there were apple-trees like that in  the world, for all the nursery walls were papered like that, with a row  of big round red apples at the top.
    But Bessie Bell did not think of or remember that then; she just leaned  up against the lady and swung one of her little feet up and down, back  and forth, as she sat on the stone bench: she was so happy to have met  the Wisest Woman in the world.
    The people who passed by looked, and turned to look again, at the  little girl in the stiff-starched, faded blue checked apron leaning up  against the lady in the crisp, dull silk.
    But Bessie Bell did not look at anybody who passed.
    And the lady did not look at anybody who passed.
    And the band kept on playing gay music.
    It was not very long before Sister Helen Vincula came back from seeing  the ladies across the long bridge, and from telling them Good-bye.
  As  soon as she saw Bessie Bell leaning up against the lady she cried:    "Why, Bessie Bell!"    Bessie Bell said, "Sister Helen Vincula," and she knew she had done  something wrong, but she could only wonder what.
    But the lady said very quickly,--and she held Bessie Bell's hand even  harder than before,--she said:    "Sister Helen Vincula, I must ask you something--"    Sister Helen Vincula and the lady talked a long time.
    Bessie Bell did not listen very much to what they said.
    She did not lean up against the lady now, but she sat close.
  Sister  Helen Vincula did not seem to mind that.
    She did not swing her foot to and fro now, but she still felt very  contented and happy to have met the very Wisest Woman.
    When she did listen a little she heard the lady say:    "There came news that my husband was ill in Mobile, and I feared that  it was of the Dreadful Fever, and I hurried there so that I could get  to him before the Dreadful Quarantines were put on.
  I felt all safe  about the baby, for I left her with my mother and the faithful nurse  who had been my nurse, too.
  But when the worst had come and was  over,--and it was the Dreadful Fever,--then I tried to get back to my  home; but I could not for many, many days, because the Dreadful  Quarantines were on.
  Then at last I did get there--I slipped up  secretly by water.
  All were gone.
 I could find no one who could tell  me anything.
  I could find no one who knew anything.
  The house was  wide open.
  There was no sign of life, but that the cat came and rubbed  up against me, and walked round and round me.
  The Dreadful Fever was  everywhere, and nobody could tell me anything; and I searched  everywhere, always and always alone--there was no one to help me:  everyone was trying to save from the Dreadful Fever--"    Bessie Bell did not know what all that was about, but she felt so sorry  for the lady that she squeezed down ever so softly on her hand that  held her own still so tightly.
    Sister Helen Vincula wiped her eyes.
    The lady kept looking away off, but still held Bessie Bell's hand in  hers.
    Then Sister Helen Vincula said: "We are going away to-morrow.
"    But the lady held fast to Bessie Bell's hand and said: "Not this little  girl.
"    "Oh," said Sister Helen Vincula, "but she is in my charge, and so what  can I do!"    And the lady said: "I cannot let her leave me--not ever.
"    But Sister Helen Vincula said: "Oh, madam, you do not know.
  No matter  what we hope, we do not know--"    But the lady held still faster to Bessie Bell's hand.
    "Oh," said Sister Helen Vincula, "I have a thought! Come to our cabin  with me.
"    So they went.
    And Bessie Bell walked between Sister Helen Vincula and the lady.
    And they each held one of her little pink hands.
    When they were at the cabin Sister Helen Vincula opened the old trunk  with the brass tacks on it, and she went down to the very bottom of it,  unpacking as she went.
  For the old trunk was almost entirely packed  for the going away to-morrow.
  Then Sister Helen Vincula took out, from  almost the bottom of the trunk, the little white night-gown that had  "Bessie Bell" written on it with linen thread.
    And Sister Helen Vincula laid the little white night-gown across the  lady's lap.
    Then the lady read the name written with the linen thread.
    The lady said: "I worked this name with my own hands.
"    She drew Bessie Bell closer to her, and she said: "Sister Helen  Vincula, can you doubt?"    Bessie Bell stood contentedly where the lady held her, and she looked  first at the night-gown and then at the lady, then at Sister Helen  Vincula.
  She did not know or care what it was all about--she scarcely  wondered.
    "Sister Helen Vincula," said the lady, "I know past all doubting that I  worked this name.
  You believe that.
  Much more past all doubting do  you not know--You must know--"    "Ah," said Sister Helen Vincula, "I hope with you.
" She reached for the  little night-gown, and she smoothed it in her fingers.
  "Ah," she said,  "the child has grown since she has been with us, so much, but the  little gown--it looks--really smaller to me--"    But the lady was not listening to Sister Helen Vincula.
  She had her  arms about Bessie Bell's shoulders and was looking into her face.
    "I am glad I brought the little gown," Sister Helen Vincula was saying;  "the child was so ill, so fearfully thin, I feared--it was only a  fancy--I feared--"    "No, no, no," cried the lady, drawing Bessie Bell closer.
    "Now nearly two years she has been with us," said Sister Helen Vincula.
    "She was just old enough to be put to the table in a high chair," said  the lady.
  "Ah, how she did laugh and crow and jump when her father  took the peacock-feather-fly-brush from the maid, and waved it in front  of her!  She would seize the ends of the feathers, and laugh and crow  louder than ever, and hide her laughing little face deep into the  feathers--Ah me--"    But Bessie Bell said nothing, nor remembered anything.
  For she did not  know that the lady was talking of something green, and blue, and soft,  and brown.
    And it was Sister Justina, and not Sister Helen Vincula, who had told  her to be ashamed when she had cried: Pretty! Pretty! Pretty!  as the  something green, and blue, and soft, and brown was waved to and fro in  front of her until she seized it and buried her little face in it for  the joy--of remembering--    So Sister Helen Vincula did not know, and Bessie Bell did not remember,  while the lady talked.
    Only long after, when Bessie Bell grew much larger, it happened that  whenever she saw an old-fashioned peacock-feather-fly-brush--at first,  just for a second, she felt very glad; and then, just for a second, she  felt very sorry; and she never knew or could remember why.
  She forgot  after awhile how she had been so full of sorrow when Sister Justina  said, Be Ashamed, and she could no longer remember why she was glad;  only a feeling of both was left--and she could not tell how or why.
    But the lady would not let Bessie Bell get far from her, and Bessie did  not care to go far from her.
  She stood with her little pink hands  folded, and looked up at the lady who held to her so closely.
    Sister Helen Vincula said: "It was Sister Theckla who spent that summer  with the sick, and it was Sister Theckla who brought the child to us.
  Can you not go home with us?  Or I could write to you at once--"    "No," said the lady.
 "I will go.
  The child shall not leave me--'    "And we will talk to Sister Theckla, and she will tell us all that she  knows, and then--God willing--we shall know all.
"    The lady said: "Yes, we will all go together.
  We will go at once.
"    And so it was that when Sister Theckla had told all that she knew, then  the lady knew (as she always had said she had known), past all  doubting, that Bessie Bell had really found what she most wished for.
    But we do not know how long it was before Bessie Bell really understood  that the Wisest Woman in the world, who knew what little girls had  almost forgotten how to remember, was her own Mother.
                     When all the people on the high, cool mountains heard about all that  the lady knew, and all that Sister Theckla told, and all that Bessie  Bell had found, they were all as glad as they could be.
    And when the boy with the long-striped-stocking-legs heard all about it  he said: "That is fine!  Bessie Bell said that she would find a  Mama--and she has!"              End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Somebody's Little Girl, by Martha Young    .

          CONTENTS                                 PAGE  THE ROADMENDER                  1  OUT OF THE SHADOW              61  AT THE WHITE GATE             119    The Roadmender            I HAVE attained my ideal: I am a roadmender, some say stonebreaker.
  Both  titles are correct, but the one is more pregnant than the other.
  All day  I sit by the roadside on a stretch of grass under a high hedge of  saplings and a tangle of travellers joy, woodbine, sweetbrier, and late  roses.
  Opposite me is a white gate, seldom used, if one may judge from  the trail of honeysuckle growing tranquilly along it: I know now that  whenever and wherever I die my soul will pass out through this white  gate; and then, thank God, I shall not have need to undo that trail.
    In our youth we discussed our ideals freely: I wonder how many beside  myself have attained, or would understand my attaining.
  After all, what  do we ask of life, here or indeed hereafter, but leave to serve, to live,  to commune with our fellowmen and with ourselves; and from the lap of  earth to look up into the face of God?  All these gifts are mine as I sit  by the winding white road and serve the footsteps of my fellows.
  There  is no room in my life for avarice or anxiety; I who serve at the altar  live of the altar: I lack nothing but have nothing over; and when the  winter of life comes I shall join the company of weary old men who sit on  the sunny side of the workhouse wall and wait for the tender mercies of  God.
    Just now it is the summer of things; there is life and music  everywherein the stones themselves, and I live to-day beating out the  rhythmical hammer-song of The Ring.
  There is real physical joy in the  rise and swing of the arm, in the jar of a fair stroke, the split and  scatter of the quartz: I am learning to be ambidextrous, for why should  Esau sell his birthright when there is enough for both?  Then the  rest-hour comes, bringing the luxurious ache of tired but not weary  limbs; and I lie outstretched and renew my strength, sometimes with my  face deep-nestled in the cool green grass, sometimes on my back looking  up into the blue sky which no wise man would wish to fathom.
    The birds have no fear of me; am I not also of the brown brethren in my  sober fustian livery?  They share my mealsat least the little dun-coated  Franciscans do; the blackbirds and thrushes care not a whit for such  simple food as crumbs, but with legs well apart and claws tense with  purchase they disinter poor brother worm, having first mocked him with  sound of rain.
  The robin that lives by the gate regards my heap of  stones as subject to his special inspection.
  He sits atop and practises  the trill of his summer song until it shrills above and through the  metallic clang of my strokes; and when I pause he cocks his tail, with a  humorous twinkle of his round eye which meansWhat! shirking, big  brother?and I fall, ashamed, to my mending of roads.
    The other day, as I lay with my face in the grass, I heard a gentle  rustle, and raised my head to find a hedge-snake watching me fearless,  unwinking.
  I stretched out my hand, picked it up unresisting, and put it  in my coat like the husbandman of old.
  Was he so ill-rewarded, I wonder,  with the kiss that reveals secrets?  My snake slept in peace while I  hammered away with an odd quickening of heart as I thought how to me, as  to Melampus, had come the messengerhad come, but to ears deafened by  centuries of misrule, blindness, and oppression; so that, with all my  longing, I am shut out of the wondrous world where walked Melampus and  the Saint.
  To me there is no suggestion of evil in the little silent  creatures, harmless, or deadly only with the Death which is Life.
  The  beasts who turn upon us, as a rule maul and tear unreflectingly; with the  snake there is the swift, silent strike, the tiny, tiny wound, then sleep  and a forgetting.
    My brown friend, with its message unspoken, slid away into the grass at  sundown to tell its tale in unstopped ears; and I, my task done, went  home across the fields to the solitary cottage where I lodge.
  It is old  and decrepittwo rooms, with a quasi-attic over them reached by a ladder  from the kitchen and reached only by me.
  It is furnished with the  luxuries of life, a truckle bed, table, chair, and huge earthenware pan  which I fill from the ice-cold well at the back of the cottage.
  Morning  and night I serve with the Gibeonites, their curse my blessing, as no  doubt it was theirs when their hearts were purged by service.
  Morning  and night I send down the moss-grown bucket with its urgent message from  a dry and dusty world; the chain tightens through my hand as the liquid  treasure responds to the messenger, and then with creak and janglethe  welcome of labouring earththe bucket slowly nears the top and disperses  the treasure in the waiting vessels.
  The Gibeonites were servants in the  house of God, ministers of the sacrament of service even as the High  Priest himself; and I, sharing their high office of servitude, thank God  that the ground was accursed for my sake, for surely that curse was the  womb of all unborn blessing.
    The old widow with whom I lodge has been deaf for the last twenty years.
  She speaks in the strained high voice which protests against her own  infirmity, and her eyes have the pathetic look of those who search in  silence.
  For many years she lived alone with her son, who laboured on  the farm two miles away.
  He met his death rescuing a carthorse from its  burning stable; and the farmer gave the cottage rent free and a weekly  half-crown for life to the poor old woman whose dearest terror was the  workhouse.
  With my shilling a week rent, and sharing of supplies, we  live in the lines of comfort.
  Of death she has no fears, for in the long  chest in the kitchen lie a web of coarse white linen, two pennies covered  with the same to keep down tired eyelids, decent white stockings, and a  white cotton sun-bonneta decorous death-suit trulyand enough money in  the little bag for self-respecting burial.
  The farmer buried his servant  handsomelygood man, he knew the love of reticent grief for a kind  burialand one day Harrys mother is to lie beside him in the little  churchyard which has been a cornfield, and may some day be one again.
              ON Sundays my feet take ever the same way.
  First my temple service, and  then five miles tramp over the tender, dewy fields, with their ineffable  earthy smell, until I reach the little church at the foot of the  grey-green down.
  Here, every Sunday, a young priest from a neighbouring  village says Mass for the tiny hamlet, where all are very old or very  youngfor the heyday of life has no part under the long shadow of the  hills, but is away at sea or in service.
  There is a beautiful seemliness  in the extreme youth of the priest who serves these aged children of God.
  He bends to communicate them with the reverent tenderness of a son, and  reads with the careful intonation of far-seeing love.
  To the old people  he is the son of their old age, God-sent to guide their tottering  footsteps along the highway of foolish wayfarers; and he, with his youth  and strength, wishes no better task.
  Service ended, we greet each other  friendlyfor men should not be strange in the acre of God; and I pass  through the little hamlet and out and up on the grey down beyond.
  Here,  at the last gate, I pause for breakfast; and then up and on with  quickening pulse, and evergreen memory of the weary war-worn Greeks who  broke rank to greet the great blue Mother-way that led to home.
  I stand  on the summit hatless, the wind in my hair, the smack of salt on my  cheek, all round me rolling stretches of cloud-shadowed down, no sound  but the shrill mourn of the peewit and the gathering of the sea.
    The hours pass, the shadows lengthen, the sheep-bells clang; and I lie in  my niche under the stunted hawthorn watching the to and fro of the sea,  and olus shepherding his white sheep across the blue.
  I love the sea  with its impenetrable fathoms, its wash and undertow, and rasp of shingle  sucked anew.
  I love it for its secret dead in the Caverns of Peace, of  which account must be given when the books are opened and earth and  heaven have fled away.
  Yet in my love there is a paradox, for as I watch  the restless, ineffective waves I think of the measureless, reflective  depths of the still and silent Sea of Glass, of the dead, small and  great, rich or poor, with the works which follow them, and of the Voice  as the voice of many waters, when the multitude of one mind rends heaven  with alleluia: and I lie so still that I almost feel the kiss of White  Peace on my mouth.
  Later still, when the flare of the sinking sun has  died away and the stars rise out of a veil of purple cloud, I take my way  home, down the slopes, through the hamlet, and across miles of sleeping  fields; over which night has thrown her shifting web of misthome to the  little attic, the deep, cool well, the kindly wrinkled face with its  listening eyespeace in my heart and thankfulness for the rhythm of the  road.
    Monday brings the joy of work, second only to the Sabbath of rest, and I  settle to my heap by the white gate.
  Soon I hear the distant stamp of  horsehoofs, heralding the grind and roll of the wheels which reaches me  latera heavy flour-waggon with a team of four great gentle horses, gay  with brass trappings and scarlet ear-caps.
  On the top of the craftily  piled sacks lies the white-clad waggoner, a pink in his mouth which he  mumbles meditatively, and the reins looped over the inactive whipwhy  should he drive a willing team that knows the journey and responds as  strenuously to a cheery chirrup as to the well-directed lash?  We greet  and pass the time of day, and as he mounts the rise he calls back a  warning of coming rain.
  I am already white with dust as he with flour,  sacramental dust, the outward and visible sign of the stir and beat of  the heart of labouring life.
    Next to pass down the road is an anxious ruffled hen, her speckled breast  astir with maternal troubles.
  She walks delicately, lifting her feet  high and glancing furtively from side to side with comb low dressed.
  The  sight of man, the heartless egg-collector, from whose haunts she has  fled, wrings from her a startled cluck, and she makes for the white gate,  climbs through, and disappears.
  I know her feelings too well to intrude.
  Many times already has she hidden herself, amassed four or five precious  treasures, brooding over them with anxious hope; and then, after a brief  desertion to seek the necessary food, she has returned to find her  efforts at concealment vain, her treasures gone.
  At last, with the  courage of despair she has resolved to brave the terrors of the unknown  and seek a haunt beyond the tyranny of man.
  I will watch over her from  afar, and when her mother-hope is fulfilled I will marshal her and her  brood back to the farm where she belongs; for what end I care not to  think, it is of the mystery which lies at the heart of things; and we are  all Gods beasts, says St Augustine.
    Here is my stone-song, a paraphrase of the Treasure Motif.
       [Picture: Music score: F# dotted crotchet, F# quaver, F# quaver, F#   dotted crotchet, D crotchet, E crotchet.
  This bar is then repeated once                                    more]    What a wonderful work Wagner has done for humanity in translating the  toil of life into the readable script of music!  For those who seek the  tale of other worlds his magic is silent; but earth-travail under his  wand becomes instinct with rhythmic song to an accompaniment of the  elements, and the blare and crash of the bottomless pit itself.
  The  Pilgrims March is the sad sound of footsore men; the San Graal the  tremulous yearning of servitude for richer, deeper bondage.
  The yellow,  thirsty flames lick up the willing sacrifice, the water wails the secret  of the river and the sea; the birds and beasts, the shepherd with his  pipe, the underground life in rocks and caverns, all cry their message to  this nineteenth-century toiling, labouring worldand to me as I mend my  road.
    Two tramps come and fling themselves by me as I eat my noonday meal.
  The  one, red-eyed, furtive, lies on his side with restless, clutching hands  that tear and twist and torture the living grass, while his lips mutter  incoherently.
  The other sits stooped, bare-footed, legs wide apart, his  face grey, almost as grey as his stubbly beard; and it is not long since  Death looked him in the eyes.
  He tells me querulously of a two hundred  miles tramp since early spring, of search for work, casual jobs with more  kicks than halfpence, and a brief but blissful sojourn in a hospital bed,  from which he was dismissed with sentence passed upon him.
  For himself,  he is determined to die on the road under a hedge, where a man can see  and breathe.
  His anxiety is all for his fellow; _he_ has said he will  do for a man; he wants to swing, to get out of his dogs life.
  I  watch him as he lies, this Ishmael and would-be Lamech.
  Ignorance,  hunger, terror, the exhaustion of past generations, have done their work.
  The man is mad, and would kill his fellowman.
    Presently we part, and the two go, dogged and footsore, down the road  which is to lead them into the great silence.
              YESTERDAY was a day of encounters.
    First, early in the morning, a young girl came down the road on a  bicycle.
  Her dressguard was loose, and she stopped to ask for a piece of  string.
  When I had tied it for her she looked at me, at my worn dusty  clothes and burnt face; and then she took a Niphetos rose from her belt  and laid it shyly in my dirty disfigured palm.
  I bared my head, and  stood hat in hand looking after her as she rode away up the hill.
  Then I  took my treasure and put it in a nest of cool dewy grass under the hedge.
  _Ecce ancilla Domini_.
    My next visitor was a fellow-worker on his way to a job at the  cross-roads.
  He stood gazing meditatively at my heap of stones.
    Ow long ave yer bin at this job that yere in such a hurry?    I stayed my hammer to answerFour months.
    Seen better days?    Never, I said emphatically, and punctuated the remark with a stone  split neatly in four.
    The man surveyed me in silence for a moment; then he said slowly, Mean  ter say yer like crackin these blamed stones to fill oles some other  fools made?    I nodded.
    Well, that beats everything.
  Now, I _ave_ seen better days; worked in  a big brewery over near Maidstonea town that, and something doing; and  now, ere I am, ammering me eart out on these blasted stones for a bit  o bread and a pipe o baccy once a weekit aint good enough.
  He  pulled a blackened clay from his pocket and began slowly filling it with  rank tobacco; then he lit it carefully behind his battered hat, put the  spent match back in his pocket, rose to his feet, hitched his braces,  and, with a silent nod to me, went on to his job.
    Why do we give these tired children, whose minds move slowly, whose eyes  are holden that they cannot read the Book, whose hearts are full of sore  resentment against they know not what, such work as this to dohammering  their hearts out for a bit of bread?  All the pathos of unreasoning  labour rings in these few words.
  We fit the collar on unwilling necks;  and when their service is over we bid them go out free; but we break the  good Mosaic law and send them away empty.
  What wonder there is so little  willing service, so few ears ready to be thrust through against the  masters door.
    The swift stride of civilisation is leaving behind individual effort, and  turning man into the Dmon of a machine.
  To and fro in front of the long  loom, lifting a lever at either end, paces he who once with painstaking  intelligence drove the shuttle.
  _Then_ he tasted the joy of completed  work, that which his eye had looked upon, and his hands had handled; now  his work is as little finished as the web of Penelope.
  Once the reaper  grasped the golden corn stems, and with dexterous sweep of sickle set  free the treasure of the earth.
  Once the creatures of the field were  known to him, and his eye caught the flare of scarlet and blue as the  frail poppies and sturdy corn-cockles laid down their beauty at his feet;  now he sits serene on Juggernauts car, its guiding Dmon, and the field  is silent to him.
    As with the web and the grain so with the wood and stone in the  treasure-house of our needs.
  The ground was accursed _for our sake_ that  in the sweat of our brow we might eat bread.
  Now the many live in the  brain-sweat of the few; and it must be so, for as little as great King  Cnut could stay the sea until it had reached the appointed place, so  little can we raise a barrier to the wave of progress, and say, Thus far  and no further shalt thou come.
    What then?  This at least; if we live in an age of mechanism let us see  to it that we are a race of intelligent mechanics; and if man is to be  the Dmon of a machine let him know the setting of the knives, the rise  of the piston, the part that each wheel and rod plays in the economy of  the whole, the part that he himself plays, co-operating with it.
  Then,  when he has lived and served intelligently, let us give him of our flocks  and of our floor that he may learn to rest in the lengthening shadows  until he is called to his work above.
    So I sat, hammering out my thoughts, and with them the conviction that  stonebreaking should be allotted to minor poets or vagrant children of  nature like myself, never to such tired folk as my poor mate at the  cross-roads and his fellows.
    At noon, when I stopped for my meal, the sun was baking the hard white  road in a pitiless glare.
  Several waggons and carts passed, the horses  sweating and straining, with drooping, fly-tormented ears.
  The men for  the most part nodded slumberously on the shaft, seeking the little  shelter the cart afforded; but one shuffled in the white dust, with an  occasional chirrup and friendly pressure on the tired horses neck.
    Then an old woman and a small child appeared in sight, both with enormous  sun-bonnets and carrying baskets.
  As they came up with me the woman  stopped and swept her face with her hand, while the child, depositing the  basket in the dust with great care, wiped her little sticky fingers on  her pinafore.
  Then the shady hedge beckoned them and they came and sat  down near me.
  The woman looked about seventy, tall, angular, dauntless,  good for another ten years of hard work.
  The little maidher only  grandchild, she told mewas just four, her father away soldiering, and  the mother died in childbed, so for four years the child had known no  other guardian or playmate than the old woman.
  She was not the least  shy, but had the strange self-possession which comes from associating  with one who has travelled far on lifes journey.
    I couldnt leave her alone in the house, said her grandmother, and she  wouldnt leave the kitten for fear it should be lonesomewith a  humorous, tender glance at the childbut its a long tramp in the heat  for the little one, and weve another mile to go.
    Will you let her bide here till you come back? I said.
  Shell be all  right by me.
    The old lady hesitated.
    Will ee stay by him, dearie? she said.
    The small child nodded, drew from her miniature pocket a piece of  sweetstuff, extracted from the basket a small black cat, and settled in  for the afternoon.
  Her grandmother rose, took her basket, and, with a  nod and Thank ee kindly, mister, went off down the road.
    I went back to my work a little depressedwhy had I not white hair?for a  few minutes had shown me that I was not old enough for the child despite  my forty years.
  She was quite happy with the little black cat, which lay  in the small lap blinking its yellow eyes at the sun; and presently an  old man came by, lame and bent, with gnarled twisted hands, leaning  heavily on his stick.
    He greeted me in a high, piping voice, limped across to the child, and  sat down.
  Your little maid, mister? he said.
    I explained.
    Ah, he said, Ive left a little darlin like this at ome.
  Its ard  on us old folks when were one too many; but the little mouths must be  filled, and my son, e said e didnt see they could keep me on the  arf-crown, with another child on the way; so Im tramping to N, to the  House; but its a ard pinch, leavin the little ones.
    I looked at hima typical countryman, with white hair, mild blue eyes,  and a rosy, childish, unwrinkled face.
    Im eighty-four, he went on, and terrible bad with the rheumatics and  my chest.
  Maybe itll not be long before the Lord remembers me.
    The child crept close and put a sticky little hand confidingly into the  tired old palm.
  The two looked strangely alike, for the world seems much  the same to those who leave it behind as to those who have but taken the  first step on its circular pathway.
    Ook at my kitty, she said, pointing to the small creature in her lap.
  Then, as the old man touched it with trembling fingers she went onOo  isnt my grandad; hes away in the sky, but Ill kiss oo.
    I worked on, hearing at intervals the old piping voice and the  child-treble, much of a note; and thinking of the blessings vouchsafed to  the simple old age which crowns a harmless working-life spent in the  fields.
  The two under the hedge had everything in common and were  boundlessly content together, the sting of the knowledge of good and evil  past for the one, and for the other still to come; while I stood on the  battlefield of the world, the flesh, and the devil, though, thank God,  with my face to the foe.
    The old man sat resting: I had promised him a lift with my friend the  driver of the flour-cart, and he was almost due when the childs  grandmother came down the road.
    When she saw my other visitor she stood amazed.
    What, Richard Hunton, that worked with my old man years ago up at  Ditton, whatever are you doin all these miles from your own place?    Is it Eliza Jakes?    He looked at her dazed, doubtful.
    An who else should it be?  Wheres your memory gone, Richard Hunton,  and you not such a great age either?  Where are you stayin?    Shame overcame him; his lips trembled, his mild blue eyes filled with  tears.
  I told the tale as I had heard it, and Mrs Jakess indignation  was good to see.
    Not keep you on alf a crown!  Send you to the House!  May the Lord  forgive them!  You wouldnt eat no more than a fair-sized cat, and not  long for this world either, thats plain to see.
  No, Richard Hunton, you  dont go to the House while Im above ground; itd make my good man turn  to think of it.
  Youll come ome with me and the little un there.
  Ive  my washin, and a bit put by for a rainy day, and a bed to spare, and the  Lord and the parson will see I dont come to want.
    She stopped breathless, her defensive motherhood in arms.
    The old man said quaveringly, in the pathetic, grudging phrase of the  poor, which veils their gratitude while it testifies their independence,  Maybe I might as well.
  He rose with difficulty, picked up his bundle  and stick, the small child replaced the kitten in its basket, and thrust  her hand in her new friends.
    Then oo _is_ grandad tum back, she said.
    Mrs Jakes had been fumbling in her pocket, and extracted a penny, which  she pressed on me.
    Its little enough, mister, she said.
    Then, as I tried to return it: Nay, Ive enough, and yours is poor paid  work.
    I hope I shall always be able to keep that penny; and as I watched the  three going down the dusty white road, with the child in the middle, I  thanked God for the Brotherhood of the Poor.
              YESTERDAY a funeral passed, from the work-house at N, a quaint sepulture  without solemnities.
  The rough, ungarnished coffin of stained deal lay  bare and unsightly on the floor of an old market-cart; a woman sat  beside, steadying it with her feet.
  The husband drove; and the most  depressed of the three was the horse, a broken-kneed, flea-bitten grey.
  It was pathetic, this bringing home in death of the old father whom,  while he lived, they had been too poor to house; it was at no small  sacrifice that they had spared him that terror of old age, a paupers  grave, and brought him to lie by his wife in our quiet churchyard.
  They  felt no emotion, this husband and wife, only a dull sense of filial duty  done, respectability preserved; and above and through all, the bitter but  necessary counting the cost of this last bed.
    It is strange how pagan many of us are in our beliefs.
  True, the funeral  libations have made way for the comfortable bake-meats; still, to the  large majority Death is Pluto, king of the dark Unknown whence no  traveller returns, rather than Azrael, brother and friend, lord of this  mansion of life.
  Strange how men shun him as he waits in the shadow,  watching our puny straining after immortality, sending his comrade sleep  to prepare us for himself.
  When the hour strikes he comesvery gently,  very tenderly, if we will but have it sofolds the tired hands together,  takes the way-worn feet in his broad strong palm; and lifting us in his  wonderful arms he bears us swiftly down the valley and across the waters  of Remembrance.
    Very pleasant art thou, O Brother Death, thy love is wonderful, passing  the love of women.
                                            To-day I have lived in a whirl of dust.
  To-morrow is the great annual  Cattle Fair at E, and through the long hot hours the beasts from all the  district round have streamed in broken procession along my road, to  change hands or to die.
  Surely the lordship over creation implies wise  and gentle rule for intelligent use, not the pursuit of a mere immediate  end, without any thought of community in the great sacrament of life.
    For the most part mystery has ceased for this working Western world, and  with it reverence.
  Coventry Patmore says: God clothes Himself actually  and literally with His whole creation.
  Herbs take up and assimilate  minerals, beasts assimilate herbs, and God, in the Incarnation and its  proper Sacrament, assimilates us, who, says St Augustine, are Gods  beasts.
  It is man in his blind self-seeking who separates woof from  weft in the living garment of God, and loses the more as he neglects the  outward and visible signs of a world-wide grace.
    In olden days the herd led his flock, going first in the post of danger  to defend the creatures he had weaned from their natural habits for his  various uses.
  Now that good relationship has ceased for us to exist, man  drives the beasts before him, means to his end, but with no harmony  between end and means.
  All day long the droves of sheep pass me on their  lame and patient way, no longer freely and instinctively following a  protector and forerunner, but _driven_, impelled by force and resistless  willthe same will which once went before without force.
  They are all  trimmed as much as possible to one pattern, and all make the same sad  plaint.
  It is a day on which to thank God for the unknown tongue.
  The  drover and his lad in dusty blue coats plod along stolidly, deaf and  blind to all but the way before them; no longer wielding the crook,  instrument of deliverance, or at most of gentle compulsion, but armed  with a heavy stick and mechanically dealing blows on the short thick  fleeces; without evil intent because without thoughtit is the ritual of  the trade.
    Of all the poor dumb pilgrims of the road the bullocks are the most  terrible to see.
  They are not patient, but go most unwillingly with  lowered head and furtive sideways motion, in their eyes a horror of great  fear.
  The sleek cattle, knee deep in pasture, massed at the gate, and  stared mild-eyed and with inquiring bellow at the retreating drove; but  these passed without answer on to the Unknown, and for them it spelt  death.
    Behind a squadron of sleek, well-fed cart-horses, formed in fours, with  straw braid in mane and tail, came the ponies, for the most part a merry  company.
  Long strings of rusty, shaggy two-year-olds, unbroken, unkempt,  the short Down grass still sweet on their tongues; full of fun, frolic,  and wickedness, biting and pulling, casting longing eyes at the  hedgerows.
  The boys appear to recognise them as kindred spirits, and are  curiously forbearing and patient.
  Soon both ponies and boys vanish in a  white whirl, and a long line of carts, which had evidently waited for the  dust to subside, comes slowly up the incline.
  For the most part they  carry the pigs and fowls, carriage folk of the road.
  The latter are hot,  crowded, and dusty under the open netting; the former for the most part  cheerfully remonstrative.
    I drew a breath of relief as the noise of wheels died away and my road  sank into silence.
  The hedgerows are no longer green but white and  choked with dust, a sight to move good sister Rain to welcome tears.
  The  birds seem to have fled before the noisy confusion.
  I wonder whether my  snake has seen and smiled at the clumsy ruling of the lord he so little  heeds?  I turned aside through the gate to plunge face and hands into the  cool of the sheltered grass that side the hedge, and then rested my eyes  on the stretch of green I had lacked all day.
  The rabbits had apparently  played and browsed unmindful of the stir, and were still flirting their  white tails along the hedgerows; a lark rose, another and another, and I  went back to my road.
  Peace still reigned, for the shadows were  lengthening, and there would be little more traffic for the fair.
  I  turned to my work, grateful for the stillness, and saw on the white  stretch of road a lone old man and a pig.
  Surely I knew that tall figure  in the quaint grey smock, surely I knew the face, furrowed like natures  face in springtime, and crowned by a round, soft hat?  And the pig, the  black pig walking decorously free?  Ay, I knew them.
    In the early spring I took a whole holiday and a long tramp; and towards  afternoon, tired and thirsty, sought water at a little lonely cottage  whose windows peered and blinked under overhanging brows of thatch.
  I  had, not the water I asked for, but milk and a bowl of sweet porridge for  which I paid only thanks; and stayed for a chat with my kindly hosts.
  They were a quaint old couple of the kind rarely met with nowadays.
  They  enjoyed a little pension from the Squire and a garden in which vegetables  and flowers lived side by side in friendliest fashion.
  Bees worked and  sang over the thyme and marjoram, blooming early in a sunny nook; and in  a homely sty lived a solemn black pig, a pig with a history.
    It was no common utilitarian pig, but the honoured guest of the old  couple, and it knew it.
  A year before, their youngest and only surviving  child, then a man of five-and-twenty, had brought his mother the result  of his savings in the shape of a fine young pig: a week later he lay dead  of the typhoid that scourged Maidstone.
  Hence the pig was sacred, cared  for and loved by this Darby and Joan.
    Ee be mos like a child to me and the mother, an mos as sensible as a  Christian, ee be, the old man had said; and I could hardly credit my  eyes when I saw the tall bent figure side by side with the black pig,  coming along my road on such a day.
    I hailed the old man, and both turned aside; but he gazed at me without  remembrance.
    I spoke of the pig and its history.
  He nodded wearily.
  Ay, ay, lad,  youve got it; tis poor Dicks pig right enow.
    But youre never going to take it to E?    Ay, but I be, and comin back alone, if the Lord be marciful.
  The  missus has been terrible bad this two mouths and more; Squires in  foreign parts; and food-stuffs such as the old woman wants is hard buying  for poor folks.
  The stockings empty, now tis the pig must go, and I  believe hed be glad for to do the missus a turn; she were terrible good  to him, were the missus, and fond, too.
  I dursnt tell her he was to go;  shed sooner starve than lose poor Dicks pig.
  Well, wed best be  movin; tis a fairish step.
    The pig followed comprehending and docile, and as the quaint couple  passed from sight I thought I heard Brother Death stir in the shadow.
  He  is a strong angel and of great pity.
              THERE is always a little fire of wood on the open hearth in the kitchen  when I get home at night; the old lady says it is company for her, and  sits in the lonely twilight, her knotted hands lying quiet on her lap,  her listening eyes fixed on the burning sticks.
    I wonder sometimes whether she hears music in the leap and lick of the  fiery tongues, music such as he of Bayreuth draws from the violins till  the hot energy of the fire spirit is on us, embodied in sound.
    Surely she hears some voice, that lonely old woman on whom is set the  seal of great silence?    It is a great truth tenderly said that God builds the nest for the blind  bird; and may it not be that He opens closed eyes and unstops deaf ears  to sights and sounds from which others by these very senses are debarred?    Here the best of us see through a mist of tears men as trees walking; it  is only in the land which is very far off and yet very near that we shall  have fulness of sight and see the King in His beauty; and I cannot think  that any listening ears listen in vain.
    The coppice at our back is full of birds, for it is far from the road and  they nest there undisturbed year after year.
  Through the still night I  heard the nightingales calling, calling, until I could bear it no longer  and went softly out into the luminous dark.
    The little wood was manifold with sound, I heard my little brothers who  move by night rustling in grass and tree.
  A hedgehog crossed my path  with a dull squeak, the bats shrilled high to the stars, a white owl  swept past me crying his hunting note, a beetle boomed suddenly in my  face; and above and through it all the nightingales sangand sang!    The night wind bent the listening trees, and the stars yearned earthward  to hear the song of deathless love.
  Louder and louder the wonderful  notes rose and fell in a passion of melody; and then sank to rest on that  low thrilling call which it is said Death once heard, and stayed his  hand.
    They will scarcely sing again this year, these nightingales, for they are  late on the wing as it is.
  It seems as if on such nights they sang as  the swan sings, knowing it to be the last timewith the lavish note of  one who bids an eternal farewell.
    At last there was silence.
  Sitting under the big beech tree, the giant  of the coppice, I rested my tired self in the lap of mother earth,  breathed of her breath and listened to her voice in the quickening  silence until my flesh came again as the flesh of a little child, for it  is true recreation to sit at the footstool of God wrapped in a fold of  His living robe, the while night smoothes our tired face with her healing  hands.
    The grey dawn awoke and stole with trailing robes across earths floor.
  At her footsteps the birds roused from sleep and cried a greeting; the  sky flushed and paled conscious of coming splendour; and overhead a file  of swans passed with broad strong flight to the reeded waters of the  sequestered pool.
    Another hour of silence while the light throbbed and flamed in the east;  then the larks rose harmonious from a neighbouring field, the rabbits  scurried with ears alert to their morning meal, the day had begun.
    I passed through the coppice and out into the fields beyond.
  The dew lay  heavy on leaf and blade and gossamer, a cool fresh wind swept clear over  dale and down from the sea, and the clover field rippled like a silvery  lake in the breeze.
    There is something inexpressibly beautiful in the unused day, something  beautiful in the fact that it is still untouched, unsoiled; and town and  country share alike in this loveliness.
  At half-past three on a June  morning even London has not assumed her responsibilities, but smiles and  glows lighthearted and smokeless under the caresses of the morning sun.
    Five oclock.
  The bell rings out crisp and clear from the monastery  where the Bedesmen of St Hugh watch and pray for the souls on this  labouring forgetful earth.
  Every hour the note of comfort and warning  cries across the land, tells the Sanctus, the Angelus, and the Hours of  the Passion, and calls to remembrance and prayer.
    When the wind is north, the sound carries as far as my road, and  companies me through the day; and if to His dumb children God in His  mercy reckons work as prayer, most certainly those who have forged  through the ages an unbroken chain of supplication and thanksgiving will  be counted among the stalwart labourers of the house of the Lord.
    Sun and bell together are my only clock: it is time for my water drawing;  and gathering a pile of mushrooms, children of the night, I hasten home.
    The cottage is dear to me in its quaint untidiness and want of rectitude,  dear because we are to be its last denizens, last of the long line of  toilers who have sweated and sown that others might reap, and have passed  away leaving no trace.
    I once saw a tall cross in a seaboard churchyard, inscribed, To the  memory of the unknown dead who have perished in these waters.
  There  might be one in every village sleeping-place to the unhonoured many who  made fruitful the land with sweat and tears.
  It is a consolation to  think that when we look back on this stretch of lifes road from beyond  the first milestone, which, it is instructive to remember, is always a  grave, we may hope to see the work of this world with open eyes, and to  judge of it with a due sense of proportion.
    A bee with laden honey-bag hummed and buzzed in the hedge as I got ready  for work, importuning the flowers for that which he could not carry, and  finally giving up the attempt in despair fell asleep on a buttercup, the  best place for his weary little velvet body.
  In five minutesthey may  have been five hours to himhe awoke a new bee, sensible and  clear-sighted, and flew blithely away to the hive with his sufficiencyan  example this weary world would be wise to follow.
    My road has been lonely to-day.
  A parson came by in the afternoon, a  stranger in the neighbourhood, for he asked his way.
  He talked awhile,  and with kindly rebuke said it was sad to see a man of my education  brought so low, which shows how the outside appearance may mislead the  prejudiced observer.
  Was it misfortune?  Nay, the best of good luck,  I answered, gaily.
    The good man with beautiful readiness sat down on a heap of stones and  bade me say on.
  Read me a sermon in stone, he said, simply; and I  stayed my hand to read.
    He listened with courteous intelligence.
    You hold a roadmender has a vocation? he asked.
    As the monk or the artist, for, like both, he is universal.
  The world  is his home; he serves all men alike, ay, and for him the beasts have  equal honour with the men.
  His soul is bound up in the bundle of life  with all other souls, he sees his father, his mother, his brethren in the  children of the road.
  For him there is nothing unclean, nothing common;  the very stones cry out that they serve.
    Parson nodded his head.
    It is all true, he said; beautifully true.
  But need such a view of  life necessitate the work of roadmending?  Surely all men should be  roadmenders.
    O wise parson, so to read the lesson of the road!    It is true, I answered; but some of us find our salvation in the  actual work, and earn our bread better in this than in any other way.
  No  man is dependent on our earning, all men on our work.
  We are rich  beyond the dreams of avarice because we have all that we need, and yet  we taste the life and poverty of the very poor.
  We are, if you will,  uncloistered monks, preaching friars who speak not with the tongue,  disciples who hear the wise words of a silent master.
    Robert Louis Stevenson was a roadmender, said the wise parson.
    Ay, and with more than his pen, I answered.
  I wonder was he ever so  truly great, so entirely the man we know and love, as when he inspired  the chiefs to make a highway in the wilderness.
  Surely no more fitting  monument could exist to his memory than the Road of Gratitude, cut, laid,  and kept by the pure-blooded tribe kings of Samoa.
    Parson nodded.
    He knew that the people who make no roads are ruled out from intelligent  participation in the worlds brotherhood.
  He filled his pipe, thinking  the while, then he held out his pouch to me.
    Try some of this baccy, he said; Sherwood of Magdalen sent it me from  some outlandish place.
    I accepted gratefully.
  It was such tobacco as falls to the lot of few  roadmenders.
    He rose to go.
    I wish I could come and break stones, he said, a little wistfully.
    Nay, said I, few men have such weary roadmending as yours, and perhaps  you need my road less than most men, and less than most parsons.
    We shook hands, and he went down the road and out of my life.
    He little guessed that I knew Sherwood, ay, and knew him too, for had not  Sherwood told me of the man he delighted to honour.
    Ah, well!  I am no Browning Junior, and Sherwoods name is not Sherwood.
              AWHILE ago I took a holiday; mouched, played truant from my road.
  Jem  the waggoner hailed me as he passedhe was going to the millwould I ride  with him and come back atop of the full sacks?    I hid my hammer in the hedge, climbed into the great waggon white and  fragrant with the clean sweet meal, and flung myself down on the empty  flour bags.
  The looped-back tarpaulin framed the long vista of my road  with the downs beyond; and I lay in the cool dark, caressed by the fresh  breeze in its thoroughfare, soothed by the strong monotonous tramp of the  great grey team and the music of the jangling harness.
    Jem walked at the leaders heads; it is his rule when the waggon is  empty, a rule no company will make him break.
  At first I regretted it,  but soon discovered I learnt to know him better so, as he plodded along,  his thickset figure slightly bent, his hands in his pockets, his whip  under one arm, whistling hymn tunes in a low minor, while the great  horses answered to his voice without touch of lash or guiding rein.
    I lay as in a blissful dream and watched my road unfold.
  The sun set the  pine-boles aflare where the hedge is sparse, and stretched the long  shadows of the besom poplars in slanting bars across the white highway;  the roadside gardens smiled friendly with their trim-cut laurels and rows  of stately sunflowersa seemly proximity this, Daphne and Clytie, sisters  in experience, wrapped in the warm caress of the god whose wooing they  need no longer fear.
  Here and there we passed little groups of women and  children off to work in the early cornfields, and Jem paused in his fond  repetition of The Lord my pasture shall prepare to give them good-day.
    It is like Life, this travelling backwardsthat which has been, alone  visiblelike Life, which is after all, retrospective with a steady moving  on into the Unknown, Unseen, until Faith is lost in Sight and experience  is no longer the touchstone of humanity.
  The face of the son of Adam is  set on the road his brothers have travelled, marking their landmarks,  tracing their journeyings; but with the eyes of a child of God he looks  forward, straining to catch a glimpse of the jewelled walls of his future  home, the city Eternal in the Heavens.
    Presently we left my road for the deep shade of a narrow country way  where the great oaks and beeches meet overhead and no hedge-clipper sets  his hand to stay natures profusion; and so by pleasant lanes scarce the  waggons width across, now shady, now sunny, here bordered by thickset  coverts, there giving on fruitful fields, we came at length to the mill.
    I left Jem to his business with the miller and wandered down the flowery  meadow to listen to the merry clack of the stream and the voice of the  waters on the weir.
  The great wheel was at rest, as I love best to see  it in the later afternoon; the splash and churn of the water belong  rather to the morning hours.
  It is the chief mistake we make in  portioning out our day that we banish rest to the night-time, which is  for sleep and recreating, instead of setting apart the later afternoon  and quiet twilight hours for the stretching of weary limbs and repose of  tired mind after a days toil that should begin and end at five.
    The little stone bridge over the mill-stream is almost on a level with  the clear running water, and I lay there and gazed at the huge wheel  which, under multitudinous forms and uses, is one of the worlds wonders,  because one of the few things we imitative children have not learnt from  nature.
  Is it perchance a memory out of that past when Adam walked  clear-eyed in Paradise and talked with the Lord in the cool of the day?  Did he see then the flaming wheels instinct with service, wondrous  messengers of the Most High vouchsafed in vision to the later prophets?    Maybe he did, and going forth from before the avenging sword of his own  forging to the bitterness of an accursed earth, took with him this bright  memory of perfect, ceaseless service, and so fashioned our labouring  wheelpathetic link with the time of his innocency.
  It is one of many  unanswered questions, good to ask because it has no answer, only the  suggestion of a train of thought: perhaps we are never so receptive as  when with folded hands we say simply, This is a great mystery.
  I  watched and wondered until Jem called, and I had to leave the rippling  weir and the waters side, and the wheel with its untold secret.
    The millers wife gave me tea and a crust of home-made bread, and the  millers little maid sat on my knee while I told the sad tale of a little  pink cloud separated from its parents and teazed and hunted by  mischievous little airs.
  To-morrow, if I mistake not, her garden will be  wet with its tears, and, let us hope, point a moral; for the tale had its  origin in a frenzied chicken driven from the side of an anxious mother,  and pursued by a sturdy, relentless figure in a white sun-bonnet.
    The little maid trotted off, greatly sobered, to look somewhat  prematurely for the clouds tears; and I climbed to my place at the top  of the piled-up sacks, and thence watched twilight pass to starlight  through my narrow peep, and, so watching, slept until Jems voice hailed  me from Dreamland, and I went, only half awake, across the dark fields  home.
    Autumn is here and it is already late.
  He has painted the hedges russet  and gold, scarlet and black, and a tangle of grey; now he has damp brown  leaves in his hair and frost in his finger-tips.
    It is a season of contrasts; at first all is stir and bustle, the  ingathering of man and beast; barn and rickyard stand filled with golden  treasure; at the farm the sound of threshing; in wood and copse the  squirrels busied twixt tree and storehouse, while the ripe nuts fall  with thud of thunder rain.
  When the harvesting is over, the fruit  gathered, the last rick thatched, there comes a pause.
  Earth strips off  her bright colours and shows a bare and furrowed face; the dead leaves  fall gently and sadly through the calm, sweet air; grey mists drape the  fields and hedges.
  The migratory birds have left, save a few late  swallows; and as I sit at work in the soft, still rain, I can hear the  blackbirds melancholy trill and the thin pipe of the redbreasts winter  songthe air is full of the sound of farewell.
    Forethought and preparation for the Future which shall be; farewell,  because of the Future which may never befor us; Man, thou hast goods  laid up for many years, and it is well; but, remember, this night _thy_  soul may be required; is the unvoiced lesson of autumn.
  There is  growing up among us a great fear; it stares at us white, wide-eyed, from  the faces of men and women alikethe fear of pain, mental and bodily  pain.
  For the last twenty years we have waged war with sufferinga noble  war when fought in the interest of the many, but fraught with great  danger to each individual man.
  It is the fear which should not be,  rather than the hope which is in us, that leads men in these days to  drape Death in a flowery mantle, to lay stress on the shortness of  parting, the speedy reunion, to postpone their good-byes until the last  moment, or avoid saying them altogether; and this fear is a poor, ignoble  thing, unworthy of those who are as gods, knowing good and evil.
  We are  still paying the price of that knowledge; suffering in both kinds is a  substantial part of it, and brings its own healing.
  Let us pay like men,  our face to the open heaven, neither whimpering like children in the  dark, nor lulled to unnecessary oblivion by some lethal drug; for it is  manly, not morbid, to dare to taste the pungent savour of pain, the  lingering sadness of farewell which emphasises the aftermath of life; it  should have its place in all our preparation as a part of our inheritance  we dare not be without.
    There is an old couple in our village who are past work.
  The married  daughter has made shift to take her mother and the parish half-crown, but  there is neither room nor food for the father, and he must go to N.
  If  husband and wife went together, they would be separated at the workhouse  door.
  The parting had to come; it came yesterday.
  I saw them stumbling  lamely down the road on their last journey together, walking side by side  without touch or speech, seeing and heeding nothing but a blank future.
  As they passed me the old man said gruffly, Tis far eno; better be  gettin back; but the woman shook her head, and they breasted the hill  together.
  At the top they paused, shook hands, and separated; one went  on, the other turned back; and as the old woman limped blindly by I  turned away, for there are sights a man dare not look upon.
  She passed;  and I heard a childs shrill voice say, I come to look for you, gran;  and I thanked God that there need be no utter loneliness in the world  while it holds a little child.
    Now it is my turn, and I must leave the wayside to serve in the  sheepfolds during the winter months.
  It is scarcely a farewell, for my  road is ubiquitous, eternal; there are green ways in Paradise and golden  streets in the beautiful City of God.
  Nevertheless, my heart is heavy;  for, viewed by the light of the waning year, roadmending seems a great  and wonderful work which I have poorly conceived of and meanly performed:  yet I have learnt to understand dimly the truths of three great  paradoxesthe blessing of a curse, the voice of silence, the  companionship of solitudeand so take my leave of this stretch of road,  and of you who have fared along the white highway through the medium of a  printed page.
    Farewell!  It is a roadmenders word; I cry you Godspeed to the next  milestoneand beyond.
          OUT OF THE SHADOW            I AM no longer a roadmender; the stretch of white highway which leads to  the end of the world will know me no more; the fields and hedgerows,  grass and leaf stiff with the crisp rime of winters breath, lie beyond  my horizon; the ewes in the folding, their mysterious eyes quick with the  consciousness of coming motherhood, answer anothers voice and hand;  while I lie here, not in the lonely companionship of my expectations, but  where the shadow is bright with kindly faces and gentle hands, until one  kinder and gentler still carries me down the stairway into the larger  room.
    But now the veil was held aside and one went by crowned with the majesty  of years, wearing the ermine of an unstained rule, the purple of her  peoples loyalty.
  Nations stood with bated breath to see her pass in the  starlit mist of her childrens tears; a monarchgreatest of her time; an  empressconquered men called mother; a womanEnglishmen cried queen;  still the crowned captive of her peoples heartthe prisoner of love.
    The night-goers passed under my window in silence, neither song nor shout  broke the welcome dark; next morning the workmen who went by were  strangely quiet.
        VICTORIA DEI GRATIA BRITANNIARUM REGINA.
    Did they think of how that legend would disappear, and of all it meant,  as they paid their pennies at the coffee-stall?  The feet rarely know the  true value and work of the head; but all Englishmen have been and will be  quick to acknowledge and revere Victoria by the grace of God a wise  woman, a great and loving mother.
    Years ago, I, standing at a level crossing, saw her pass.
  The train  slowed down and she caught sight of the gatekeepers little girl who had  climbed the barrier.
  Such a smile as she gave her!  And then I caught a  quick startled gesture as she slipped from my vision; I thought  afterwards it was that she feared the child might fall.
  Mother first,  then Queen; even so rest came to hernot in one of the royal palaces, but  in her own home, surrounded by the immediate circle of her nearest and  dearest, while the world kept watch and ward.
    I, a shy lover of the fields and woods, longed always, should a painless  passing be vouchsafed me, to make my bed on the fragrant pine needles in  the aloneness of a great forest; to lie once again as I had lain many a  time, bathed in the bitter sweetness of the sun-blessed pines, lapped in  the manifold silence; my ear attuned to the wind of Heaven with its call  from the Cities of Peace.
  In sterner mood, when Loves hand held a  scourge, I craved rather the stress of the moorland with its bleaker mind  imperative of sacrifice.
  To rest again under the lee of Rippon Tor swept  by the strong peat-smelling breeze; to stare untired at the long  cloud-shadowed reaches, and watch the mist-wraiths huddle and shrink  round the stones of blood; until my sacrifice too was accomplished, and  my soul had fled.
  A wild waste moor; a vast void sky; and naught between  heaven and earth but man, his sin-glazed eyes seeking afar the distant  light of his own heart.
    With years came counsels more profound, and the knowledge that man was no  mere dweller in the woods to follow the footsteps of the piping god, but  an integral part of an organised whole, in which Pan too has his  fulfilment.
  The wise Venetians knew; and read pantheism into  Christianity when they set these words round Ezekiels living creatures  in the altar vault of St Marks:        QUAEQUE SUB OBSCURIS DE CRISTO DICTA FIGURIS      HIS APERIRE DATUR ET IN HIS, DEUS IPSE NOTATUR.
    Thou shalt have none other gods but me.
  If man had been able to keep  this one commandment perfectly the other nine would never have been  written; instead he has comprehensively disregarded it, and perhaps never  more than now in the twentieth century.
  Ah, well! this world, in spite  of all its sinning, is still the Garden of Eden where the Lord walked  with man, not in the cool of evening, but in the heat and stress of the  immediate working day.
  There is no angel now with flaming sword to keep  the way of the Tree of Life, but tapers alight morning by morning in the  Hostel of God to point us to it; and we, who are as gods knowing good and  evil, partake of that fruit whereof whoso eateth shall never die; the  greatest gift or the most awful penaltyEternal Life.
    I then, with my craving for tree and sky, held that a great capital with  its stir of life and death, of toil and strife and pleasure, was an ill  place for a sick man to wait in; a place to shrink from as a child  shrinks from the rude blow of one out of authority.
  Yet here, far from  moor and forest, hillside and hedgerow, in the family sitting-room of the  English-speaking peoples, the London much misunderstood, I find the  fulfilment by antithesis of all desire.
  For the loneliness of the  moorland, there is the warmth and companionship of Londons swift beating  heart.
  For silence there is soundthe sound and stir of servicefor the  most part far in excess of its earthly equivalent.
  Against the fragrant  incense of the pines I set the honest sweat of the man whose lifetime is  the measure of his working day.
  He that loveth not his brother whom he  hath seen, how shall he love God whom he hath not seen? wrote Blessed  John, who himself loved so much that he beheld the Lamb as it had been  slain from the beginning when Adam fell, and the City of God with light  most precious.
  The burden of corporate sin, the sword of corporate  sorrow, the joy of corporate righteousness; thus we become citizens in  the Kingdom of God, and companions of all his creatures.
  It is not good  that the man should be alone, said the Lord God.
    I live now as it were in two worlds, the world of sight, and the world of  sound; and they scarcely ever touch each other.
  I hear the grind of  heavy traffic, the struggle of horses on the frost-breathed ground, the  decorous jolt of omnibuses, the jangle of cab bells, the sharp warning of  bicycles at the corner, the swift rattle of costers carts as they go  south at night with their shouting, goading crew.
  All these things I  hear, and more; but I see no road, only the silent river of my heart with  its tale of wonder and years, and the white beat of seagulls wings in  strong inquiring flight.
    Sometimes there is naught to see on the waterway but a solitary black  hull, a very Stygian ferry-boat, manned by a solitary figure, and moving  slowly up under the impulse of the far-reaching sweeps.
  Then the great  barges pass with their coffined treasure, drawn by a small self-righteous  steam-tug.
  Later, lightened of their load, and waiting on wind and tide,  I see them swooping by like birds set free; tawny sails that mind me of  red-roofed Whitby with its northern fleet; black sails as of some  heedless Theseus; white sails that sweep out of the morning mist like  restless gossameres.
  They make the bridge, which is just within my  vision, and then away past Westminster and Blackfriars where St Pauls  great dome lifts the cross high over a self-seeking city; past Southwark  where Englands poet illuminates in the scroll of divine wisdom the sign  of the Tabard; past the Tower with its haunting ghosts of history; past  Greenwich, fairy city, caught in the meshes of riverside mist; and then  the salt and speer of the sea, the companying with great ships, the fresh  burden.
    At night I see them again, silent, mysterious; searching the darkness  with unwinking yellow stare, led by a great green light.
  They creep up  under the bridge which spans the river with its watching eyes, and  vanish, crying back a warning note as they make the upper reach, or  strident hail, as a chain of kindred phantoms passes, ploughing a  contrary tide.
    Throughout the long watches of the night I follow them; and in the early  morning they slide by, their eyes pale in the twilight; while the stars  flicker and fade, and the gas lamps die down into a dull yellow blotch  against the glory and glow of a new day.
              FEBRUARY is here, February fill-dyke; the month of purification, of  cleansing rains and pulsing bounding streams, and white mist clinging  insistent to field and hedgerow so that when her veil is withdrawn  greenness may make us glad.
    The river has been uniformly grey of late, with no wind to ruffle its  surface or to speed the barges dropping slowly and sullenly down with the  tide through a blurring haze.
  I watched one yesterday, its useless sails  half-furled and no sign of life save the man at the helm.
  It drifted  stealthily past, and a little behind, flying low, came a solitary  seagull, grey as the rivers hazea following bird.
    Once again I lay on my back in the bottom of the tarry old fishing smack,  blue sky above and no sound but the knock, knock of the waves, and the  thud and curl of falling foam as the old boats blunt nose breasted the  coming sea.
  Then Daddy Whiddon spoke.
    A follerin burrd, he said.
    I got up, and looked across the blue field we were ploughing into white  furrows.
  Far away a tiny sail scarred the great solitude, and astern  came a gull flying slowly close to the waters breast.
    Daddy Whiddon waved his pipe towards it.
    A follerin burrd, he said, again; and again I waited; questions were  not grateful to him.
    There be a carpse there, sure enough, a carpse driftin and shiftin on  the floor of the sea.
  There be those as cant rest, poor sawls, and  herll be mun, herll be mun, and the sperrit of her is with the burrd.
    The clumsy boom swung across as we changed our course, and the water ran  from us in smooth reaches on either side: the bird flew steadily on.
    What will the spirit do? I said.
    The old man looked at me gravely.
    Herll rest in the Lards time, in the Lards gude timebut now herll  just be follerin on with the burrd.
    The gull was flying close to us now, and a cold wind swept the sunny sea.
  I shivered: Daddy looked at me curiously.
    There be reason enough to be cawld if us did but knaw it, but I he mos  used to em, poor sawls.
  He shaded his keen old blue eyes, and looked  away across the water.
  His face kindled.
  There be a skule comin, and  by my sawl tis mackerel they be drivin.
    I watched eagerly, and saw the dark line rise and fall in the trough of  the sea, and, away behind, the stir and rush of tumbling porpoises as  they chased their prey.
    Again we changed our tack, and each taking an oar, pulled lustily for the  beach.
    Please God herll break inshore, said Daddy Whiddon; and he shouted the  news to the idle waiting men who hailed us.
    In a moment all was stir, for the fishing had been slack.
  Two boats put  out with the lithe brown seine.
  The dark line had turned, but the school  was still behind, churning the water in clumsy haste; they were coming  in.
    Then the brit broke in silvery leaping waves on the shelving beach.
  The  threefold hunt was over; the porpoises turned out to sea in search of  fresh quarry; and the seine, dragged by ready hands, came slowly,  stubbornly in with its quivering treasure of fish.
  They had sought a  haven and found none; the brit lay dying in flickering iridescent heaps  as the bare-legged babies of the village gathered them up; and far away  over the water I saw a single grey speck; it was the following bird.
                                            The curtain of river haze falls back; barge and bird are alike gone, and  the lamplighter has lit the first gas-lamp on the far side of the bridge.
  Every night I watch him come, his progress marked by the great yellow  eyes that wake the dark.
  Sometimes he walks quickly; sometimes he  loiters on the bridge to chat, or stare at the dark water; but he always  comes, leaving his watchful deterrent train behind him to police the  night.
    Once Demeter in the black anguish of her desolation searched for lost  Persephone by the light of Hecates torch; and searching all in vain,  spurned beneath her empty feet an earth barren of her smile; froze with  set brows the merry brooks and streams; and smote forest, and plain, and  fruitful field, with the breath of her last despair, until even Iambes  laughing jest was still.
  And then when the desolation was complete,  across the wasted valley where the starveling cattle scarcely longed to  browse, came the dreadful chariotand Persephone.
  The day of the  prisoner of Hades had dawned; and as the sun flamed slowly up to light  her thwarted eyes the world sprang into blossom at her feet.
    We can never be too Pagan when we are truly Christian, and the old myths  are eternal truths held fast in the Churchs net.
  Prometheus fetched  fire from Heaven, to be slain forever in the fetching; and lo, a Greater  than Prometheus came to fire the cresset of the Cross.
  Demeter waits now  patiently enough.
  Persephone waits, too, in the faith of the sun she  cannot see: and every lamp lit carries on the crusade which has for its  goal a sunless, moonless, city whose light is the Light of the world.
        Lume e lassu, che visibile face      lo creatore a quella creatura,      che solo in lui vedere ha la sua pace.
    Immediately outside my window is a lime treea little black skeleton of  abundant branchesin which sparrows congregate to chirp and bicker.
  Farther away I have a glimpse of graceful planes, children of moonlight  and mist; their dainty robes, still more or less unsullied, gleam ghostly  in the gaslight athwart the dark.
  They make a brave show even in winter  with their feathery branches and swinging tassels, whereas my little tree  stands stark and uncompromising, with its horde of sooty sparrows cockney  to the last tail feather, and a pathetic inability to look anything but  black.
  Rain comes with strong caressing fingers, and the branches seem  no whit the cleaner for her care; but then their glistening blackness  mirrors back the succeeding sunlight, as a muddy pavement will sometimes  lap our feet in a sea of gold.
  The little wet sparrows are for the  moment equally transformed, for the sun turns their dun-coloured coats to  a ruddy bronze, and cries Chrysostom as it kisses each shiny beak.
  They  are dumb Chrysostoms; but they preach a golden gospel, for the sparrows  are to London what the rainbow was to eight saved souls out of a waste of  watersa perpetual sign of the remembering mercies of God.
    Last night there was a sudden clatter of hoofs, a shout, and then  silence.
  A runaway cab-horse, a dark night, a wide crossing, and a heavy  burden: so death came to a poor woman.
  People from the house went out to  help; and I heard of her, the centre of an unknowing curious crowd, as  she lay bonnetless in the mud of the road, her head on the kerb.
  A rude  but painless death: the misery lay in her life; for this womanworn,  white-haired, and wrinkledhad but fifty years to set against such a  condition.
  The policeman reported her respectable, hard-working, living  apart from her husband with a sister; but although they shared rooms,  they did not speak, and the sister refused all responsibility; so the  parish buried the dead woman, and thus ended an uneventful tragedy.
    Was it her own fault?  If so, the greater pathos.
  The lonely souls that  hold out timid hands to an unheeding world have their meed of interior  comfort even here, while the sons of consolation wait on the thresh-hold  for their footfall: but God help the soul that bars its own door!  It is  kicking against the pricks of Divine ordinance, the ordinance of a triune  God; whether it be the dweller in crowded street or tenement who is proud  to say, I keep myself to myself, or Seneca writing in pitiful  complacency, Whenever I have gone among men, I have returned home less  of a man.
  Whatever the next world holds in store, we are bidden in this  to seek and serve God in our fellow-men, and in the creatures of His  making whom He calls by name.
    It was once my privilege to know an old organ-grinder named Gawdine.
  He  was a hard swearer, a hard drinker, a hard liver, and he fortified  himself body and soul against the world: he even drank alone, which is an  evil sign.
    One day to Gawdine sober came a little dirty child, who clung to his  empty trouser leghe had lost a limb years beforewith a persistent  unintelligible request.
  He shook the little chap off with a blow and a  curse; and the child was trotting dismally away, when it suddenly turned,  ran back, and held up a dirty face for a kiss.
    Two days later Gawdine fell under a passing dray which inflicted terrible  internal injuries on him.
  They patched him up in hospital, and he went  back to his organ-grinding, taking with him two friendsa pain which fell  suddenly upon him to rack and rend with an anguish of crucifixion, and  the memory of a childs upturned face.
  Outwardly he was the same save  that he changed the tunes of his organ, out of long-hoarded savings, for  the jigs and reels which children hold dear, and stood patiently playing  them in child-crowded alleys, where pennies are not as plentiful as  elsewhere.
    He continued to drink; it did not come within his new code to stop, since  he could carry his liquor well; but he rarely, if ever, swore.
  He told  me this tale through the throes of his anguish as he lay crouched on a  mattress on the floor; and as the grip of the pain took him he tore and  bit at his hands until they were maimed and bleeding, to keep the ready  curses off his lips.
    He told the story, but he gave no reason, offered no explanation: he has  been dead now many a year, and thus would I write his epitaph:    He saw the face of a little child and looked on God.
              TWO began, in a low voice, Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here  ought to have been a _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by  mistake.
    As I look round this room I feel sure Two, and Five, and Seven, have all  been at work on it, and made no mistakes, for round the walls runs a  frieze of squat standard rose-trees, red as red can be, and just like  those that Alice saw in the Queens garden.
  In between them are  Chaucers name-children, prim little daisies, peering wideawake from  green grass.
  This same grass has a history which I have heard.
  In the  original stencil for the frieze it was purely conventional like the rest,  and met in spikey curves round each tree; the painter, however, who was  doing the work, was a lover of the fields; and feeling that such grass  was a travesty, he added on his own account dainty little tussocks, and  softened the hard line into a tufted carpet, the grass growing  irregularly, bent at will by the wind.
    The result from the standpoint of conventional art is indeed disastrous;  but my sympathy and gratitude are with the painter.
  I see, as he saw,  the far-reaching robe of living ineffable green, of whose brilliance the  eye never has too much, and in whose weft no two threads are alike; and  shrink as he did from the conventionalising of that windswept glory.
    The sea has its crested waves of recognisable form; the river its eddy  and swirl and separate vortices; but the grass!  The wind bloweth where  it listeth and the grass bows as the wind blowsthou canst not tell  whither it goeth.
  It takes no pattern, it obeys no recognised law; it  is like a beautiful creature of a thousand wayward moods, and its voice  is like nothing else in the wide world.
  It bids you rest and bury your  tired face in the green coolness, and breathe of its breath and of the  breath of the good earth from which man was taken and to which he will  one day return.
  Then, if you lend your ear and are silent minded, you  may hear wondrous things of the deep places of the earth; of life in  mineral and stone as well as in pulsing sap; of a green world as the  stars saw it before man trod it under footof the emerald which has its  place with the rest in the City of God.
                    What if earth      Be but the shadow of heaven, and things therein,      Each to each other like, more than on earth to thought?    It is a natural part of civilisations lust of re-arrangement that we  should be so ready to conventionalise the beauty of this world into  decorative patterns for our pilgrim tents.
  It is a phase, and will melt  into other phases; but it tends to the increase of artificiality, and  exists not only in art but in everything.
  It is no new thing for jaded  sentiment to crave the spur of the unnatural, to prefer the clever  imitation, to live in a Devachan where the surroundings appear that which  we would have them to be; but it is an interesting record of the pulse of  the present day that An Englishwomans Love Letters should have taken  society by storm in the way it certainly has.
    It is a delightful book to leave about, with its vellum binding, dainty  ribbons, and the hallmark of a great publishers name.
  But when we seek  within we find love with its thousand voices and wayward moods, its shy  graces and seemly reticences, love which has its throne and robe of state  as well as the garment of the beggar maid, love which is before time was,  which knew the world when the stars took up their courses, presented to  us in gushing outpourings, the appropriate language of a womans heart to  the boor she delights to honour.
    It is woman who is the glory of man, says the author of The House of  Wisdom and Love, _Regina mundi_, greater, because so far the less; and  man is her head, but only as he serves his queen.
  Set this sober  aphorism against the school girl love-making which kisses a mans feet  and gaily refuses him the barren honour of having loved her first.
    There is scant need for the apologia which precedes the letters; a few  pages dispels the fear that we are prying into anothers soul.
  As for  the authorship, there is a womans influence, an artists poorly  concealed bias in the foreign letters; and for the rest a mans  blundersso much easier to see in another than to avoid oneselfwrit  large from cover to cover.
  King Cophetua, who sends profoundly grateful  remembrances, has most surely written the letters he would wish to  receive.
    Mrs Meynell! cries one reviewer, triumphantly.
  Nay, the saints be good  to us, what has Mrs Meynell in common with the Englishwomans language,  style, or most unconvincing passion?  Men can write as from a womans  heart when they are minded to do so in desperate earnestnessthere is  Clarissa Harlowe and Stevensons Kirstie, and many more to prove it; but  when a man writes as the author of the Love Letters writes, I feel, as  did the painter of the frieze, that pattern-making has gone too far and  included that which, like the grass, should be spared such a convention.
    I quite agree with you, said the Duchess, and the moral of that isBe  what you would seem to beor, if youd like to put it more simplynever  imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others  that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had  been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.
  And so by way of the  Queens garden I come back to my room again.
    My hearts affections are still centred on my old attic, with boarded  floor and white-washed walls, where the sun blazoned a frieze of red and  gold until he travelled too far towards the north, the moon streamed in  to paint the trees in inky wavering shadows, and the stars flashed their  glory to me across the years.
  But now sun and moon greet me only  indirectly, and under the red roses hang pictures, some of them the dear  companions of my days.
  Opposite me is the Arundel print of the  Presentation, painted by the gentle Brother of the Angels.
  Priest  Simeon, a stately figure in green and gold, great with prophecy, gazes  adoringly at the Bambino he holds with fatherly care.
  Our Lady, in robe  of red and veil of shadowed purple, is instinct with light despite the  sombre colouring, as she stretches out hungering, awe-struck hands for  her souls delight.
  St Joseph, dignified guardian and servitor, stands  behind, holding the Sacrifice of the Poor to redeem the First-begotten.
    St Peter Martyr and the Dominican nun, gazing in rapt contemplation at  the scene, are not one whit surprised to find themselves in the presence  of eternal mysteries.
  In the Entombment, which hangs on the opposite  wall, St Dominic comes round the corner full of grievous amaze and  tenderest sympathy, but with no sense of shock or intrusion, for was he  not famigliar di Cristo?  And so he takes it all in; the stone bed  empty and waiting; the Beloved cradled for the last time on His mothers  knees to be washed, lapped round, and laid to rest as if He were again  the Babe of Bethlehem.
  He sees the Magdalen anointing the Sacred Feet;  Blessed John caring for the living and the Dead; and he, Dominichound of  the Lordhaving his real, living share in the anguish and hope, the  bedding of the dearest Dead, who did but leave this earth that He might  manifest Himself more completely.
    Underneath, with a leap across the centuries, is Rossettis picture;  Dante this time the onlooker, Beatrice, in her pale beauty, the  death-kissed one.
  The same idea under different representations; the one  conceived in childlike simplicity, the other recalling, even in the  photograph, its wealth of colour and imagining; the one a world-wide  ideal, the other an individual expression of it.
    Beatrice was to Dante the inclusion of belief.
  She was more to him than  he himself knew, far more to him after her death than before.
  And,  therefore, the analogy between the pictures has at core a common reality.
  It is expedient for you that I go away, is constantly being said to us  as we cling earthlike to the outward expression, rather than to the  inward manifestationand blessed are those who hear and understand, for  it is spoken only to such as have been with Him from the beginning.
  The  eternal mysteries come into time for us individually under widely  differing forms.
  The tiny child mothers its doll, croons to it, spends  herself upon it, why she cannot tell you; and we who are here in our  extreme youth, never to be men and women grown in this world, nurse our  ideal, exchange it, refashion it, call it by many names; and at last in  here or hereafter we find in its naked truth the Child in the manger,  even as the Wise Men found Him when they came from the East to seek a  great King.
  There is but one necessary condition of this finding; we  must follow the particular manifestation of light given us, never resting  until it restsover the place of the Child.
  And there is but one  insurmountable hindrance, the extinction of or drawing back from the  light truly apprehended by us.
  We forget this, and judge other men by  the light of our own soul.
    I think the old bishop must have understood it.
  He is my friend of  friends as he lies opposite my window in his alabaster sleep, clad in  pontifical robes, with unshod feet, a little island of white peace in a  many-coloured marble sea.
  The faithful sculptor has given every line and  wrinkle, the heavy eyelids and sunken face of tired old age, but withal  the smile of a contented child.
    I do not even know my bishops name, only that the work is of the  thirteenth century; but he is good to company with through the day, for  he has known darkness and light and the minds of many men; most surely,  too, he has known that God fulfils Himself in strange ways, so with the  shadow of his feet upon the polished floor he rests in peace.
              ON Sunday my little tree was limned in white and the sparrows were  craving shelter at my window from the blizzard.
  Now the mild thin air  brings a breath of spring in its wake and the daffodils in the garden  wait the kisses of the sun.
  Hand-in-hand with memory I slip away down  the years, and remember a day when I awoke at earliest dawn, for across  my sleep I had heard the lusty golden-throated trumpeters heralding the  spring.
    The air was sharp-set; a delicate rime frosted roof and road; the sea lay  hazy and still like a great pearl.
  Then as the sky stirred with flush  upon flush of warm rosy light, it passed from misty pearl to opal with  heart of flame, from opal to gleaming sapphire.
  The earth called, the  fields called, the river calledthat pied piper to whose music a man  cannot stop his ears.
  It was with me as with the Canterbury pilgrims:        So priketh hem nature in hir corages;      Than longen folk to gon on pilgrimages.
    Half an hour later I was away by the early train that carries the branch  mails and a few workmen, and was delivered at the little wayside station  with the letters.
  The kind air went singing past as I swung along the  reverberating road between the high tree-crowned banks which we call  hedges in merry Devon, with all the world to myself and the Brethren.
  A  great blackbird flew out with a loud chook, chook, and the red of the  haw on his yellow bill.
  A robin trilled from a low rose-bush; two wrens  searched diligently on a fallen tree for breakfast, quite unconcerned  when I rested a moment beside them; and a shrewmouse slipped across the  road followed directly by its mate.
  March violets bloomed under the  sheltered hedge with here and there a pale primrose; a frosted bramble  spray still held its autumn tints clinging to the semblance of the past;  and great branches of snowy blackthorn broke the barren hedgeway as if  spring made a mock of winters snows.
    Light of heart and foot with the new wine of the year I sped on again,  stray daffodils lighting the wayside, until I heard the voice of the  stream and reached the field gate which leads to the lower meadows.
  There before me lay springs pageant; green pennons waving, dainty maids  curtseying, and a host of joyous yellow trumpeters proclaiming Victory  to an awakened earth.
  They range in serried ranks right down to the  river, so that a man must walk warily to reach the waters edge where  they stand gazing down at themselves in fairest semblance like their most  tragic progenitor, and, rising from the bright grass in their thousands,  stretch away until they melt in a golden cloud at the far end of the  misty mead.
  Through the field gate and across the road I see them,  starring the steep earth bank that leads to the upper copse, gleaming  like pale flames against the dark tree-boles.
  There they have but frail  tenure; here, in the meadows, they reign supreme.
    At the upper end of the field the river provides yet closer sanctuary for  these children of the spring.
  Held in its embracing arms lies an island  long and narrow, some thirty feet by twelve, a veritable untrod Eldorado,  glorious in gold from end to end, a fringe of reeds by the waters edge,  and save for thatdaffodils.
  A great oak stands at the meadows neck, an  oak with gnarled and wandering roots where a man may rest, for it is bare  of daffodils save for a group of three, and a solitary one apart growing  close to the old trees side.
  I sat down by my lonely little sister,  blue sky overhead, green grass at my feet decked, like the pastures of  the Blessed, in glorious sheen; a sea of triumphant, golden heads tossing  blithely back as the wind swept down to play with them at his pleasure.
    It was all mine to have and to hold without severing a single slender  stem or harbouring a thought of covetousness; mine, as the whole earth  was mine, to appropriate to myself without the burden and bane of worldly  possession.
  Thou sayest that I ama King, said the Lord before Pilate,  and My kingdom is not of this world.
  We who are made kings after His  likeness possess all things, not after this worlds fashion but in  proportion to our poverty; and when we cease to toil and spin, are  arrayed as the lilies, in a glory transcending Solomons.
  Bride  Povertyshe who climbed the Cross with Christstretched out eager hands  to free us from our chains, but we flee from her, and lay up treasure  against her importunity, while Amytas on his seaweed bed weeps tears of  pure pity for crave-mouth Csar of great possessions.
    Presently another of springs lovers cried across the water Cuckoo,  cuckoo, and the voice of the stream sang joyously in unison.
  It is free  from burden, this merry little river, and neither weir nor mill bars its  quick way to the sea as it completes the eternal circle, lavishing gifts  of coolness and refreshment on the children of the meadows.
    It has its birth on the great lone moor, cradled in a wonderful  peat-smelling bog, with a many-hued coverlet of soft mossespale gold,  orange, emerald, tawny, olive and white, with the red stain of sun-dew  and tufted cotton-grass.
  Under the old grey rocks which watch it rise,  yellow-eyed tormantil stars the turf, and bids Godspeed to the little  child of earth and sky.
  Thus the journey begins; and with  ever-increasing strength the stream carves a way through the dear brown  peat, wears a fresh wrinkle on the patient stones, and patters merrily  under a clapper bridge which spanned its breadth when the mistletoe  reigned and Bottor, the grim rock idol, exacted the toll of human life  that made him great.
  On and on goes the stream, for it may not stay;  leaving of its freshness with the great osmunda that stretches eager  roots towards the running water; flowing awhile with a brother stream, to  part again east and west as each takes up his separate burden of  servicemy friend to cherish the lower meadows in their flowery  joyanceand so by the great sea-gate back to sky and earth again.
    The river of God is full of water.
  The streets of the City are pure  gold.
  Verily, here also having nothing we possess all things.
                                            The air was keen and still as I walked back in the early evening, and a  daffodil light was in the sky as if Heaven mirrored back earths  radiance.
  Near the station some children flitted past, like little white  miller moths homing through the dusk.
  As I climbed the hill the moon  rode high in a golden fieldit was daffodils to the last.
              THE seagulls from the upper reaches pass down the river in sober steady  flight seeking the open sea.
  I shall miss the swoop and circle of silver  wings in the sunlight and the plaintive call which sounds so strangely  away from rock and shore, but it is good to know that they have gone from  mudbank and murky town back to the free airs of their inheritance, to the  shadow of sun-swept cliffs and the curling crest of the wind-beaten  waves, to brood again over the great ocean of a worlds tears.
    My little tree is gemmed with buds, shy, immature, but full of promise.
  The sparrows busied with nest-building in the neighbouring pipes and  gutters use it for a vantage ground, and crowd there in numbers, each  little beak sealed with long golden straw or downy feather.
    The river is heavy with hay barges, the last fruits of winters  storehouse; the lengthening days slowly and steadily oust the dark; the  air is loud with a growing clamour of life: spring is not only  proclaimed, but on this Feast she is crowned, and despite the warring  wind the days bring their meed of sunshine.
  We stand for a moment at the  meeting of the ways, the handclasp of Winter and Spring, of Sleep and  Wakening, of Life and Death; and there is between them not even the thin  line which Rabbi Jochanan on his death-bed beheld as all that divided  hell from heaven.
    _Sphra cujus centrum ubique_, _circumferentia nullibus_, was said of  Mercury, that messenger of the gods who marshalled reluctant spirits to  the Underworld; and for Mercury we may write Life with Death as its great  sacrament of brotherhood and release, to be dreaded only as we dread to  partake unworthily of great benefits.
  Like all sacraments it has its  rightful time and due solemnities; the horror and sin of suicide lie in  the presumption of free will, the forestalling of a gift,the sin of Eve  in Paradise, who took that which might only be given at the hand of the  Lord.
  It has too its physical pains, but they are those of a woman in  travail, and we remember them no more for joy that a child-man is born  into the world naked and not ashamed: beholding ourselves as we are we  shall see also the leaves of the Tree of Life set for the healing of the  nations.
    We are slowly, very slowly, abandoning our belief in sudden and violent  transitions for a surer and fuller acceptance of the doctrine of  evolution; but most of us still draw a sharp line of demarcation between  this world and the next, and expect a radical change in ourselves and our  surroundings, a break in the chain of continuity entirely contrary to the  teaching of nature and experience.
  In the same way we cling to the  specious untruth that we can begin over and over again in this world,  forgetting that while our sorrow and repentance bring sacramental gifts  of grace and strength, God Himself cannot, by His own limitation, rewrite  the Past.
  We are in our sorrow that which we have made ourselves in our  sin; our temptations are there as well as the way of escape.
  We are in  the image of God.
  We create our world, our undying selves, our heaven,  or our hell.
  _Qui creavit te sine te non salvabit te sine te_.
  It is  stupendous, magnificent, and most appalling.
  A man does not change as he  crosses the threshold of the larger room.
  His personality remains the  same, although the expression of it may be altered.
  Here we have  material bodies in a material worldthere, perhaps, ether bodies in an  ether world.
  There is no indecency in reasonable speculation and  curiosity about the life to come.
  One end of the thread is between our  fingers, but we are haunted for the most part by the snap of Atropos  shears.
    Socrates faced death with the magnificent calm bred of dignified  familiarity.
  He had built for himself a desired heaven of colour, light,  and precious stonesthe philosophic formula of those who set the  spiritual above the material, and worship truth in the beauty of  holiness.
  He is not troubled by doubts or regrets, for the path of the  just lies plain before his face.
  He forbids mourning and lamentations as  out of place, obeys minutely and cheerily the directions of his  executioner, and passes with unaffected dignity to the apprehension of  that larger truth for which he had constantly prepared himself.
  His  friends may bury him provided they will remember they are not burying  Socrates; and that all things may be done decently and in order, a cock  must go to sculapius.
    Long before, in the days of the Captivity, there lived in godless,  blood-shedding Nineveh an exiled Jew whose father had fallen from the  faith.
  He was a simple man, child-like and direct; living the careful,  kindly life of an orthodox Jew, suffering many persecutions for  conscience sake, and in constant danger of death.
  He narrates the story  of his life and of the blindness which fell on him, with gentle  placidity, and checks the exuberance of his more emotional wife with the  assurance of untroubled faith.
  Finally, when his pious expectations are  fulfilled, his sight restored, and his son prosperously established  beside him, he breaks into a prayer of rejoicing which reveals the secret  of his confident content.
  He made use of two great faculties: the sense  of proportion, which enabled him to apprise life and its accidents  justly, and the gift of in-seeing, which led Socrates after him, and  Blessed John in lonely exile on Patmos, to look through the things  temporal to the hidden meanings of eternity.
    Let my soul bless God the great King, he cries; and looks away past the  present distress; past the Restoration which was to end in fresh  scattering and confusion; past the dream of gold, and porphyry, and  marble defaced by the eagles and emblems of the conqueror; until his eyes  are held by the Jerusalem of God, built up with sapphires, and emeralds,  and precious stones, with battlements of pure gold, and the cry of  Alleluia in her streets.
    Many years later, when he was very aged, he called his son to him and  gave him as heritage his own simple rule of life, adding but one request:  Keep thou the law and the commandments, and shew thyself merciful and  just, that it may go well with thee.
 .
 .
 .
 Consider what alms doeth, and  how righteousness doth deliver.
 .
 .
 .
 And bury me decently, and thy  mother with me.
  Having so said, he went his way quietly and contentedly  to the Jerusalem of his heart.
    It is the simple note of familiarity that is wanting in us; that by which  we link world with world.
  Once, years ago, I sat by the bedside of a  dying man in a wretched garret in the East End.
  He was entirely  ignorant, entirely quiescent, and entirely uninterested.
  The minister of  a neighbouring chapel came to see him and spoke to him at some length of  the need for repentance and the joys of heaven.
  After he had gone my  friend lay staring restlessly at the mass of decrepit broken chimney pots  which made his horizon.
  At last he spoke, and there was a new note in  his voice:    Ee said as ow there were golding streets in them parts.
  I aint no  ways particler wot theyre made of, but itll feel natral like if theres  chimleys too.
    The sun stretched a sudden finger and painted the chimney pots red and  gold against the smoke-dimmed sky, and with his face alight with  surprised relief my friend died.
    We are one with the earth, one in sin, one in redemption.
  It is the  fringe of the garment of God.
  If I may but touch the hem, said a  certain woman.
    On the great Death-day which shadows the early spring with a shadow of  which it may be said _Umbra Dei est Lux_, the earth brought gifts of  grief, the fruit of the curse, barren thorns, hollow reed, and the wood  of the cross; the sea made offering of Tyrian purple; the sky veiled her  face in great darkness, while the nation of priests crucified for the  last time their Paschal lamb.
  I will hear, saith the Lord; I will hear  the heavens, and they shall hear the earth, and the earth shall hear the  corn and wine and oil, and they shall hear Jezreel, and I will sow her  unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not  obtained mercy, and I will say unto them which were not my people, Thou  art my people, and they shall say Thou art my God.
    The second Adam stood in the garden with quickening feet, and all the  earth pulsed and sang for joy of the new hope and the new life quickening  within her, to be hers through the pains of travail, the pangs of  dissolution.
  The Tree of Life bears Bread and Winefood of the wayfaring  man.
  The day of divisions is past, the day of unity has dawned.
  One has  risen from the dead, and in the Valley of Achor stands wide the Door of  Hopethe Sacrament of Death.
        Scio Domine, et vere scio .

 quia non sum dignus accedere ad      tantum mysterium propter nimia peccata mea et infinitas negligentias      meas.
  Sed scio .
 .

 quia tu potes me facere dignum.
              ANYTUS and Meletus can kill me, but they cannot hurt me, said Socrates;  and Governor Sancho, with all the itch of newly-acquired authority, could  not make the young weaver of steel-heads for lances sleep in prison.
  In  the Vision of Er the souls passed straight forward under the throne of  necessity, and out into the plains of forgetfulness, where they must  severally drink of the river of unmindfulness whose waters cannot be held  in any vessel.
  The throne, the plain, and the river are still here, but  in the distance rise the great lone heavenward hills, and the wise among  us no longer ask of the gods Lethe, but rather remembrance.
  Necessity  can set me helpless on my back, but she cannot keep me there; nor can  four walls limit my vision.
  I pass out from under her throne into the  garden of God a free man, to my ultimate beatitude or my exceeding shame.
  All day long this world lies open to me; ay, and other worlds also, if I  will but have it so; and when night comes I pass into the kingdom and  power of the dark.
    I lie through the long hours and watch my bridge, which is set with  lights across the gloom; watch the traffic which is for me but so many  passing lamps telling their tale by varying height and brightness.
  I  hear under my window the sprint of over-tired horses, the rattle of  uncertain wheels as the street-sellers hasten south; the jangle of cab  bells as the theatre-goers take their homeward way; the gruff altercation  of weary men, the unmelodious song and clamorous laugh of women whose  merriment is wearier still.
  Then comes a time of stillness when the  light in the sky waxes and wanes, when the cloud-drifts obscure the  stars, and I gaze out into blackness set with watching eyes.
  No sound  comes from without but the voice of the night-wind and the cry of the  hour.
  The clock on the mantelpiece ticks imperatively, for a check has  fallen on the familiarity which breeds a disregard of common things, and  a reason has to be sought for each sound which claims a hearing.
  The  pause is wonderful while it lasts, but it is not for long.
  The working  world awakes, the poorer brethren take up the burden of service; the dawn  lights the sky; remembrance cries an end to forgetting.
    Sometimes in the country on a night in early summer you may shut the  cottage door to step out into an immense darkness which palls heaven and  earth.
  Going forward into the embrace of the great gloom, you are as a  babe swaddled by the hands of night into helpless quiescence.
  Your feet  tread an unseen path, your hands grasp at a void, or shrink from the  contact they cannot realise; your eyes are holden; your voice would die  in your throat did you seek to rend the veil of that impenetrable  silence.
    Shut in by the intangible dark, we are brought up against those worlds  within worlds blotted out by our concrete daily life.
  The working of the  great microcosm at which we peer dimly through the little window of  science; the wonderful, breathing earth; the pulsing, throbbing sap; the  growing fragrance shut in the calyx of to-morrows flower; the heart-beat  of a sleeping world that we dream that we know; and around, above, and  interpenetrating all, the world of dreams, of angels and of spirits.
    It was this world which Jacob saw on the first night of his exile, and  again when he wrestled in Peniel until the break of day.
  It was this  world which Elisha saw with open eyes; which Job knew when darkness fell  on him; which Ezekiel gazed into from his place among the captives; which  Daniel beheld as he stood alone by the great river, the river Hiddekel.
    For the moment we have left behind the realm of question and explanation,  of power over matter and the exercise of bodily faculties; and passed  into darkness alight with visions we cannot see, into silence alive with  voices we cannot hear.
  Like helpless men we set our all on the one thing  left us, and lift up our hearts, knowing that we are but a mere speck  among a myriad worlds, yet greater than the sum of them; having our roots  in the dark places of the earth, but our branches in the sweet airs of  heaven.
    It is the material counterpart of the Night of the Soul.
  We have left  our house and set forth in the darkness which paralyses those faculties  that make us men in the world of men.
  But surely the great mystics, with  all their insight and heavenly love, fell short when they sought freedom  in complete separateness from creation instead of in perfect unity with  it.
  The Greeks knew better when they flung Ariadnes crown among the  stars, and wrote Demeters grief on a barren earth, and Persephones joy  in the fruitful field.
  For the earth is gathered up in man; he is the  whole which is greater than the sum of its parts.
  Standing in the image  of God, and clothed in the garment of God, he lifts up priestly hands and  presents the sacrifice of redeemed earth before the throne of the  All-Father.
  Dust and ashes and a house of devils, he cries; and there  comes back for answer, _Rex concupiscet decorem tuam_.
    The Angel of Death has broad wings of silence and mystery with which he  shadows the valley where we need fear no evil, and where the voice which  speaks to us is as the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.
  It  is a place of healing and preparation, of peace and refreshing after the  sharply-defined outlines of a garish day.
  Walking there we learn to use  those natural faculties of the soul which are hampered by the familiarity  of bodily progress, to apprehend the truths which we have intellectually  accepted.
  It is the place of secrets where the humility which embraces  all attainable knowledge cries I know not; and while we proclaim from  the house-tops that which we have learnt, the manner of our learning lies  hid for each one of us in the sanctuary of our souls.
    The Egyptians, in their ancient wisdom, act in the desert a great  androsphinx, image of mystery and silence, staring from under level brows  across the arid sands of the sea-way.
  The Greeks borrowed and debased  the image, turning the inscrutable into a semi-woman who asked a foolish  riddle, and hurled herself down in petulant pride when dipus answered  aright.
  So we, marring the office of silence, question its mystery;  thwart ourselves with riddles of our own suggesting; and turn away,  leaving our offering but half consumed on the altar of the unknown god.
  It was not the theft of fire that brought the vengeance of heaven upon  Prometheus, but the mocking sacrifice.
  Orpheus lost Eurydice because he  must see her face before the appointed time.
  Persephone ate of the  pomegranate and hungered in gloom for the day of light which should have  been endless.
    The universe is full of miracle and mystery; the darkness and silence are  set for a sign we dare not despise.
  The pall of night lifts, leaving us  engulphed in the light of immensity under a tossing heaven of stars.
  The  dawn breaks, but it does not surprise us, for we have watched from the  valley and seen the pale twilight.
  Through the wondrous Sabbath of  faithful souls, the long day of rosemary and rue, the light brightens in  the East; and we pass on towards it with quiet feet and opening eyes,  bearing with us all of the redeemed earth that we have made our own,  until we are fulfilled in the sunrise of the great Easter Day, and the  peoples come from north and south and east and west to the City which  lieth foursquarethe Beatific Vision of God.
        Vere Ierusalem est illa civitas      Cuius pax iugis et summa iucunditas;      Ubi non prvenit rem desiderium,      Nec desiderio minus est prmium.
          AT THE WHITE GATE            A GREAT joy has come to me; one of those unexpected gifts which life  loves to bestow after we have learnt to loose our grip of her.
  I am back  in my own place very near my roadthe white gate lies within my distant  vision; near the lean grey Downs which keep watch and ward between the  country and the sea; very near, nay, in the lap of Mother Earth, for as I  write I am lying on a green carpet, powdered yellow and white with the  suns own flowers; overhead a great sycamore where the bees toil and  sing; and sighing shimmering poplars golden grey against the blue.
  The  day of Persephone has dawned for me, and I, set free like Demeters  child, gladden my eyes with this foretaste of coming radiance, and rest  my tired sense with the scent and sound of home.
  Away down the meadow I  hear the early scythe song, and the warm air is fragrant with the fallen  grass.
  It has its own message for me as I lie here, I who have obtained  yet one more mercy, and the burden of it is life, not death.
    I remember when, taking a grace from my road, I helped to mow Farmer  Marlers ten-acre field, rich in ripe upstanding grass.
  The mechanism of  the ancient reaper had given way under the strain of the home meadows,  and if this crop was to be saved it must be by hand.
  I have kept the  record of those days of joyous labour under a June sky.
  Men were hard to  get in our village; old Dodden, who was over seventy, volunteered his  serviceshe had done yeoman work with the scythe in his youthand two of  the farm hands with their master completed our strength.
    We took our places under a five oclock morning sky, and the larks cried  down to us as we stood knee-deep in the fragrant dew-steeped grass, each  man with his gleaming scythe poised ready for its sweeping swing.
  Old  Dodden led by right of age and ripe experience; bent like a sickle, brown  and dry as a nut, his face a tracery of innumerable wrinkles, he has  never ailed a day, and the cunning of his craft was still with him.
  At  first we worked stiffly, unreadily, but soon the monotonous motion  possessed us with its insistent rhythm, and the grass bowed to each  sibilant swish and fell in sweet-smelling swathes at our feet.
  Now and  then a startled rabbit scurried through the miniature forest to vanish  with white flick of tail in the tangled hedge; here and there a mother  lark was discovered sitting motionless, immovable upon her little brood;  but save for these infrequent incidents we paced steadily on with no  speech save the cry of the hone on the steel and the swish of the falling  swathes.
  The sun rose high in the heaven and burnt on bent neck and bare  and aching arms, the blood beat and drummed in my veins with the unwonted  posture and exercise; I worked as a man who sees and hears in a mist.
  Once, as I paused to whet my scythe, my eye caught the line of the  untroubled hills strong and still in the broad sunshine; then to work  again in the labouring, fertile valley.
    Rest time came, and wiping the sweat from brow and blade we sought the  welcome shadow of the hedge and the cool sweet oatmeal water with which  the wise reaper quenches his thirst.
  Farmer Marler hastened off to see  with master-eye that all went well elsewhere; the farm men slept  tranquilly, stretched at full length, clasped hands for pillow; and old  Dodden, sitting with crooked fingers interlaced to check their trembling  betrayal of old age, told how in his youth he had swep a four-acre  field single-handed in three daysan almost impossible featand of the  first reaping machine in these parts, and how it brought, to his  thinking, the ruin of agricultural morals with it.
  Tis again nature,  he said, the Lard gave us the land an the seed, but Ee said that a man  should sweat.
  Wheres the sweat drivin round wi two horses cuttin the  straw down an gatherin it again, wi scarce a hands turn i the days  work?    Old Doddens high-pitched quavering voice rose and fell, mournful as he  surveyed the present, vehement as he recorded the heroic past.
  He spoke  of the rural exodus and shook his head mournfully.
  We old uns were  content wi earth and the open sky like our feythers before us, but wi  the children tis first machines to save doin a hands turn o honest  work, an then land an sky aint big enough seeminly, nor grand enough;  it must be town an a paved street, an they sweat their lives out atwixt  four walls an call it seein lifetis death an worse comes to the most  of em.
  Ay, tis better to stay by the land, as the Lard said, till time  comes to lie under it.
  I looked away across the field where the hot air  throbbed and quivered, and the fallen grass, robbed already of its  freshness, lay prone at the feet of its upstanding fellows.
  It is quite  useless to argue with old Dodden; he only shakes his head and says  firmly, An old man, seventy-five come Martinmass knows more o life than  a young chap, stands ter reason; besides, his epitome of the town life  he knows nothing of was a just one as far as it went; and his own son is  the sweeper of a Holborn crossing, and many other things that he should  not be; but that is the parsons secret and mine.
    We took rank again and swept steadily on through the hot still hours into  the evening shadows, until the sinking sun set a _Gloria_ to the psalm of  another working day.
  Only a third of the field lay mown, for we were not  skilled labourers to cut our acre a day; I saw it again that night under  the moonlight and the starlight, wrapped in a shroud of summers mist.
    The women joined us on the third day to begin haymaking, and the air was  fragrant of tossed and sun-dried grass.
  One of them walked apart from  the rest, without interest or freedom of movement; her face, sealed and  impassive, was aged beyond the vigour of her years.
  I knew the woman by  sight, and her history by hearsay.
  We have a code of morals herenot  indeed peculiar to this place or peoplethat a wedding is respectable  if it precedes child-birth by a bare month, tolerable, and to be  recognised, should it succeed the same by less than a year (provided the  pair are not living in the same village); but the child that has never  been fathered and the wife without a ring are anathema, and such in  one was Elizabeth Banks.
  She went away a maid and came back a year ago  with a child and without a name.
  Her mother was dead, her father and the  village would have none of her: the homing instinct is very strong, or  she would scarcely have returned, knowing the traditions of the place.
  Old Dodden, seeing her, grumbled to me in the rest-time.
Cant think  what the farmer wants wi Lizzie Banks in is field.
  She must live, I  said, and by all showing her life is a hard one.
  She ad the makin  of er bed, he went on, obstinately.
  What for do she bring her  disgrace home, wi a fatherless brat for all folks to see?  We dont want  them sort in our village.
  The Lords hand is heavy, an a brats a curse  that cannot be hid.
    When tea-time came I crossed the field to look for a missing hone, and  saw Elizabeth Banks far from the other women, busied with a bundle under  the hedge.
  I passed close on my search, and lo! the bundle was a little  boy.
  He lay smiling and stretching, fighting the air with his small pink  fists, while the wind played with his curls.
  A curse that cannot be  hid, old Dodden had said.
  The mother knelt a moment, devouring him with  her eyes, then snatched him to her with aching greed and covered him with  kisses.
  I saw the poor, plain face illumined, transfigured, alive with a  mothers love, and remembered how the word came once to a Hebrew  prophet:        Say unto your brethren Ammi, and to your sisters Ruhamah.
    The evening sky was clouding fast, the sound of rain was in the air;  Farmer Marler shook his head as he looked at the grass lying in ordered  rows.
  I was the last to leave, and as I lingered at the gate drinking in  the scent of the field and the cool of the coming rain, the first drops  fell on my upturned face and kissed the poor dry swathes at my feet, and  I was glad.
    David, child of the fields and the sheepfolds, his kingship laid aside,  sees through the parted curtain of the years the advent of his greater  Son, and cries in his psalm of the hilltops, his last prophetic prayer:        He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass.
    Even so He came, and shall still come.
  Three days ago the field, in its  pageant of fresh beauty, with shimmering blades and tossing banners,  greeted sun and shower alike with joy for the furtherance of its life and  purpose; now, laid low, it hears the young grass whisper the splendour of  its coming green; and the poor swathes are glad at the telling, but full  of grief for their own apparent failure.
  Then in great pity comes the  rain, the rain of summer, gentle, refreshing, penetrating, and the  swathes are comforted, for they know that standing to greet or prostrate  to suffer, the consolations of the former and the latter rain are still  their own, with tender touch and cool caress.
  Then, once more parched by  the sun, they are borne away to the new service their apparent failure  has fitted them for; and perhaps as they wait in the dark for the unknown  that is still to come they hear sometimes the call of the distant rain,  and at the sound the dry sap stirs afreshthey are not forgotten and can  wait.
    _Say unto your sisters Ruhamah_, cries the prophet.
    _He shall come down like rain on the mown grass_, sang the poet of the  sheepfolds.
    _My ways are not your ways_, _saith the Lord_.
                                            I remember how I went home along the damp sweet-scented lanes through the  grey mist of the rain, thinking of the mown field and Elizabeth Banks and  many, many more; and that night, when the sky had cleared and the  nightingale sang, I looked out at the moon riding at anchor, a silver  boat in a still blue sea ablaze with the headlights of the stars, and the  saying of the herdsman of Tekoa came to meas it has come oftentimes  since:        Seek Him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the      shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night;      that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the      face of earth; the Lord is His name.
              THIS garden is an epitome of peace; sun and wind, rain, flowers, and  birds gather me into the blessedness of their active harmony.
  The world  holds no wish for me, now that I have come home to die with my own  people, for verify I think that the sap of grass and trees must run in my  veins, so steady is their pull upon my heart-strings.
  London claimed all  my philosophy, but the country gives all, and asks of me only the warm  receptivity of a child in its mothers arms.
    When I lie in my cool light room on the garden level, I look across the  bright grass_il verde smalto_to a great red rose bush in lavish  disarray against the dark cypress.
  Near by, amid a tangle of many-hued  corn-flowers I see the promise of coming lilies, the sudden crimson of a  solitary pony; and in lowlier state against the poor parched earth glow  the golden cups of the eschseholtzias.
  Beyond the low hedge lies pasture  bright with buttercups, where the cattle feed.
  Farther off, where the  scythe has been busy, are sheep, clean and shorn, with merry, well-grown  lambs; and in the farthest field I can see the great horses moving in  slow steady pace as the farmer turns his furrow.
    The birds are noisy comrades and old friends, from the lark which chants  the dew-steeped morning, to the nightingale that breaks the silence of  the most wonderful nights.
  I hear the wisdom of the rooks in the great  elms; the lifting lilt of the linnet, and the robins quaint little  summer song.
  The starlings chatter ceaselessly, their queer strident  voices harsh against the melodious gossip of the other birds; the martins  shrill softly as they swoop to and fro busied with their nesting under  the caves; thrush and blackbird vie in friendly rivalry like the  Meister-singer of old; sometimes I hear the drawling cry of a peacock  strayed from the great house, or the laugh of the woodpecker; and at  night the hunting note of the owl reaches me as he sweeps by in search of  prey.
    To-day I am out again; and the great sycamore showers honey and flowers  on me as I lie beneath it.
  Sometimes a bee falls like an over-ripe  fruit, and waits awhile to clean his pollen-coated legs ere he flies home  to discharge his burden.
  He is too busy to be friendly, but his great  velvety cousin is much more sociable, and stays for a gentle rub between  his noisy shimmering wings, and a nap in the hollow of my hand, for he is  an idle friendly soul with plenty of time at his own disposal and no  responsibilities.
  Looking across I can watch the martins at work; they  have a starling and a sparrow for near neighbours in the wooden gutter.
  One nest is already complete all but the coping, the other two are  a-building: I wonder whether I or they will be first to go south through  the mist.
    This great tree is a world in itself, and the denizens appear full of  curiosity as to the Gulliver who has taken up his abode beneath it.
  Pale  green caterpillars and spiders of all sizes come spinning down to visit  me, and have to be persuaded with infinite difficulty to ascend their  threads again.
  There are flies with beautiful iridescent wings, beetles  of all shapes, some of them like tiny jewels in the sunlight.
  Their  nomenclature is a sealed book to me; of their life and habits I know  nothing; yet this is but a little corner of the cosmos I am leaving, and  I feel not so much desire for the beauty to come, as a great longing to  open my eyes a little wider during the time which remains to me in this  beautiful world of Gods making, where each moment tells its own tale of  active, progressive life in which there is no undoing.
  Nature knows  naught of the web of Penelope, that acme of anxious pathetic waiting, but  goes steadily on in ever widening circle towards the fulfilment of the  mystery of God.
    There are, I take it, two master-keys to the secrets of the universe,  viewed _sub specie ternitatis_, the Incarnation of God, and the  Personality of Man; with these it is true for us as for the pantheistic  little man of contemptible speech, that all things are ours, yea, even  unto the third heaven.
    I have lost my voracious appetite for books; their language is less plain  than scent and song and the wind in the trees; and for me the clue to the  next world lies in the wisdom of earth rather than in the learning of  men.
  _Libera me ab fuscina Hophni_, prayed the good Bishop fearful of  religious greed.
  I know too much, not too little; it is realisation that  I lack, wherefore I desire these last days to confirm in myself the  sustaining goodness of God, the love which is our continuing city, the  New Jerusalem whose length, breadth, and height are all one.
  It is a  time of exceeding peace.
  There is a place waiting for me under the firs  in the quiet churchyard; thanks to my poverty I have no worldly anxieties  or personal dispositions; and I am rich in friends, many of them unknown  to me, who lavishly supply my needs and make it ideal to live on the  charity of ones fellow-men.
  I am most gladly in debt to all the world;  and to Earth, my mother, for her great beauty.
    I can never remember the time when I did not love her, this mother of  mine with her wonderful garments and ordered loveliness, her tender care  and patient bearing of mans burden.
  In the earliest days of my lonely  childhood I used to lie chin on hand amid the milkmaids, red sorrel, and  heavy spear-grass listening to her many voices, and above all to the  voice of the little brook which ran through the meadows where I used to  play: I think it has run through my whole life also, to lose itself at  last, not in the great sea but in the river that maketh glad the City of  God.
  Valley and plain, mountain and fruitful field; the larks song and  the speedwell in the grass; surely a man need not sigh for greater  loveliness until he has read something more of this living letter, and  knelt before that earth of which he is the only confusion.
    It is a grave matter that the word religion holds such away among us,  making the very gap seem to yawn again which the Incarnation once and for  ever filled full.
  We have banished the protecting gods that ruled in  river and mountain, tree and grove; we have gainsayed for the most part  folk-lore and myth, superstition and fairy-tale, evil only in their  abuse.
  We have done away with mystery, or named it deceit.
  All this we  have done in an enlightened age, but despite this policy of destruction  we have left ourselves a belief, the grandest and most simple the world  has ever known, which sanctifies the water that is shed by every passing  cloud; and gathers up in its great central act vineyard and cornfield,  proclaiming them to be that Life of the world without which a man is dead  while he liveth.
  Further, it is a belief whose foundations are the most  heavenly mystery of the Trinity, but whose centre is a little Child: it  sets a price upon the head of the sparrow, and reckons the riches of this  world at their true value; it points to a way of holiness where the fool  shall not err, and the sage may find the realisation of his far-seeking;  and yet, despite its inclusiveness, it is a belief which cannot save the  birds from destruction, the silent mountains from advertisement, or the  stream from pollution, in an avowedly Christian land.
  John Ruskin  scolded and fought and did yeoman service, somewhat hindered by his  over-good conceit of himself; but it is not the worship of beauty we need  so much as the beauty of holiness.
  Little by little the barrier grows  and religion becomes a _rule_ of life, not life itself, although the  Bride stands ready to interpret, likened in her loveliness to the chief  treasures of her handmaid-Earth.
  There is more truth in the believing  cry, Come from thy white cliffs, O Pan! than in the religion that  measures a mans life by the letter of the Ten Commandments, and erects  itself as judge and ruler over him, instead of throwing open the gate of  the garden where God walks with man from morning until morning.
    As I write the sun is setting; in the pale radiance of the sky above his  glory there dawns the evening star; and earth like a tired child turns  her face to the bosom of the night.
              ONCE again I have paid a rare visit to my tree to find many things  changed since my last sojourn there.
  The bees are silent, for the  honey-laden flowers of the sycamore are gone and in their place hang  dainty two-fold keys.
  The poplar has lost its metallic shimmer, the  chestnut its tall white candles; and the sound of the wind in the  fully-leaved branches is like the sighing of the sea.
  The martins nests  are finished, and one is occupied by a shrill-voiced brood; but for the  most part the birds parental cares are over, and the nestlings in bold  flight no longer flutter on inefficient wings across the lawn with  clamorous, open bill.
  The robins show promise of their ruddy vests, the  slim young thrush is diligently practising maturer notes, and soon Maid  June will have fled.
    It is such a wonderful world that I cannot find it in my heart to sigh  for fresh beauty amid these glories of the Lord on which I look, seeing  men as trees walking, in my material impotence which awaits the final  anointing.
  The marigolds with their orange suns, the lilies white  flame, the corncockles blue crown of many flowers, the honeysuckles  horn of fragranceI can paraphrase them, name, class, dissect them; and  then, save for the purposes of human intercourse, I stand where I stood  before, my world bounded by my capacity, the secret of colour and  fragrance still kept.
  It is difficult to believe that the second lesson  will not be the sequence of the first, and death prove a feast of  opening eyes to all these wonders, instead of the heavy-lidded slumber  to which we so often liken it.
  Earth to earth?  Yes, dust thou art,  and unto dust thou shalt return, but what of the rest?  What of the  folded grave clothes, and the Forty Days?  If the next state be, as it  well might, space of four dimensions, and the first veil which will lift  for me be the material one, then the other world which is hidden from  our grosser material organism will lie open, and declare still further to  my widening eyes and unstopped ears the glory and purpose of the manifold  garment of God.
  Knowledge will give place to understanding in that  second chamber of the House of Wisdom and Love.
  Revelation is always  measured by capacity: Open thy mouth wide, and it shall be filled with  a satisfaction that in itself is desire.
    There is a child here, a happy quiet little creature holding gently to  its two months of life.
  Sometimes they lay it beside me, I the more  helpless of the twoperhaps the more ignorantand equally dependent for  the supply of my smallest need.
  I feel indecently large as I survey its  minute perfections and the tiny balled fist lying in my great palm.
  The  little creature fixes me with the wise wide stare of a soul in advance of  its medium of expression; and I, gazing back at the mystery in those  eyes, feel the thrill of contact between my worn and sustained self and  the innocence of a little white child.
  It is wonderful to watch a  womans rapturous familiarity with these newcomers.
  A mans love has far  more awe in it, and the passionate animal instinct of defence is wanting  in him.
  A woman shall be saved through the child-bearing, said St  Paul; not necessarily her own, but by participation in the great act of  motherhood which is the crown and glory of her sex.
  She is the prisoner  of love, caught in a net of her own weaving; held fast by little hands  which rule by impotence, pursued by feet the swifter for their faltering.
    It seems incredible that this is what a woman will barter for the right  to live her own lifesurely the most empty of desires.
  Man_vir_,  woman_femina_, go to make up _the_ man_homo_.
  There can be no  comparison, no rivalry between them; they are the complement of each  other, and a little child shall lead them.
  It is easy to understand that  desire to shelter under the dear mantle of motherhood which has led to  one of the abuses of modern Romanism.
  I met an old peasant couple at  Bornhofen who had tramped many weary miles to the famous shrine of Our  Lady to plead for their only son.
  They had a few pence saved for a  candle, and afterwards when they told me their tale the old woman heaved  a sigh of relief, Es wird bald gut gehen: Die da, Sie versteht, and I  saw her later paying a farewell visit to the great understanding Mother  whom she could trust.
  Superstitious misapprehension if you will, but  also the recognition of a divine principle.
    It was Behmen, I believe, who cried with the breath of inspiration, Only  when I know God shall I know myself; and so man remains the last of all  the riddles, to be solved it may be only in Heavens perfection and the  light of the Beatific Vision.
  Know thyself is a vain legend, the more  so when emphasised by a skull; and so I company with a friend and a  stranger, and looking across at the white gate I wonder concerning the  quiet pastures and still waters that lie beyond, even as Brother Ambrose  wondered long years ago in the monastery by the forest.
        The Brother Ambrose was ever a saintly man approved of God and      beloved by the Brethren.
  To him one night, as he lay abed in the      dormitory, came the word of the Lord, saying, Come, and I will show      thee the Bride, the Lambs wife.
  And Brother Ambrose arose and was      carried to a great and high mountain, even as in the Vision of      Blessed John.
  Twas a still night of many stars, and Brother      Ambrose, looking up, saw a radiant path in the heavens; and lo! the      stars gathered themselves together on either side until they stood as      walls of light, and the four winds lapped him about as in a mantle      and bore him towards the wondrous gleaming roadway.
  Then between the      stars came the Holy City with roof and pinnacle aflame, and walls      aglow with such colours as no earthly limner dreams of, and much      gold.
  Brother Ambrose beheld the Gates of Pearl, and by every gate      an angel with wings of snow and fire, and a face no man dare look on      because of its exceeding radiance.
        Then as Brother Ambrose stretched out his arms because of his great      longing, a little grey cloud came out of the north and hung between      the walls of light, so that he no longer beheld the Vision, but only      heard a sound as of a great multitude crying Alleluia; and suddenly      the winds came about him again, and lo! he found himself in his bed      in the dormitory, and it was midnight, for the bell was ringing to      Matins; and he rose and went down with the rest.
  But when the      Brethren left the choir Brother Ambrose stayed fast in his place,      hearing and seeing nothing because of the Vision of God; and at Lauds      they found him and told the Prior.
        He questioned Brother Ambrose of the matter, and when he heard the      Vision bade him limn the Holy City even as he had seen it; and the      Precentor gave him uterine vellum and much fine gold and what colours      he asked for the work.
  Then Brother Ambrose limned a wondrous fair      city of gold with turrets and spires; and he inlaid blue for the      sapphire, and green for the emerald, and vermilion where the city      seemed aflame with the glory of God; but the angels he could not      limn, nor could he set the rest of the colours as he saw them, nor      the wall of stars on either hand; and Brother Ambrose fell sick      because of the exceeding great longing he had to limn the Holy City,      and was very sad; but the Prior bade him thank God, and remember the      infirmity of the flesh, which, like the little grey cloud, veiled      Jerusalem to his sight.
    As I write the monastery bell hard by rings out across the larks song.
  They still have time for visions behind those guarding walls, but for  most of us it is not so.
  We let slip the ideal for what we call the  real, and the golden dreams vanish while we clutch at phantoms: we speed  along lifes pathway, counting to the full the sixty minutes of every  hour, yet the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong.
  Lying here in this quiet backwater it is hard to believe that the world  without is turbulent with storm and stress and the ebb and flow of  uncertain tides.
  The little yellow cat rolling on its back among the  daisies, the staid tortoise making a stately meal off the buttercups near  me, these are great events in this haven of peace.
  And yet, looking back  to the working days, I know how much goodness and loving kindness there  is under the froth and foam.
  If we do not know ourselves we most  certainly do not know our brethren: that revelation awaits us, it may be,  first in Heaven.
  To have faith is to create; to have hope is to call  down blessing; to have love is to work miracles.
  Above all let us see  visions, visions of colour and light, of green fields and broad rivers,  of palaces laid with fair colours, and gardens where a place is found for  rosemary and rue.
    It is our prerogative to be dreamers, but there will always be men ready  to offer us death for our dreams.
  And if it must be so let us choose  death; it is gain, not loss, and the gloomy portal when we reach it is  but a white gate, the white gate maybe we have known all our lives barred  by the tendrils of the woodbine.
              RAIN, rain, rain: the little flagged path outside my window is a  streaming way, where the coming raindrops meet again the grey clouds  whose storehouse they have but just now left.
  The grass grows greener as  I watch it, the burnt patches fade, a thousand thirsty beads are uplifted  for the cooling draught.
    The great thrush that robs the raspberry canes is busy; yesterday he had  little but dust for his guerdon, but now fresh, juicy fruit repays him as  he swings to and fro on the pliant branches.
  The blackbirds and  starlings find the worms an easy preypoor brother worm ever ready for  sacrifice.
  I can hear the soft expectant chatter of the family of  martins under the roof; there will be good hunting, and they know it, for  the flies are out when the rain is over, and there are clamorous mouths  awaiting.
  My little brown brothers, the sparrows, remain my chief  delight.
  Of all the birds these nestle closest to my heart, be they  grimy little cockneys or their trim and dainty country cousins.
  They  come day by day for their meed of crumbs spread for them outside my  window, and at this season they eat leisurely and with good appetite, for  there are no hungry babies pestering to be fed.
  Very early in the  morning I hear the whirr and rustle of eager wings, and the tap, tap, of  little beaks upon the stone.
  The sound carries me back, for it was the  first to greet me when I rose to draw water and gather kindling in my  roadmender days; and if I slip back another decade they survey me,  reproving my laziness, from the foot of the narrow bed in my little attic  overseas.
    Looking along the roadway that we have travelled we see the landmarks,  great and small, which have determined the direction of our feet.
  For  some those of childhood stand out above all the rest; but I remember few  notable ones, and those few the emphatic chord of the universe, rather  than any commerce with my fellows.
  There was the night of my great  disappointment, when I was borne from my comfortable bed to see the  wonders of the moons eclipse.
  Disappointment was so great that it  sealed my lips; but, once back on my pillow, I sobbed for grief that I  had seen a wonder so far below my expectation.
  Then there was a night at  Whitby, when the wind made speech impossible, and the seas rushed up and  over the great lighthouse like the hungry spirits of the deep.
  I like  better to remember the scent of the first cowslip field under the warm  side of the hedge, when I sang to myself for pure joy of their colour and  fragrance.
  Again, there were the bluebells in the deserted quarry like  the backwash of a southern sea, and below them the miniature forest of  sheltering bracken with its quaint conceits; and, crowned above all, the  day I stood on Watcombe Down, and looked across a stretch of golden gorse  and new-turned blood-red field, the green of the headland, and beyond,  the sapphire sea.
    Time sped, and there came a day when I first set foot on German soil and  felt the throb of its paternity, the beat of our common Life.
  England is  my mother, and most dearly do I love her swelling breasts and wind-swept,  salt-strewn hair.
  Scotland gave me my name, with its haunting derivation  handed down by brave men; but Germany has always been to me the  Fatherland _par excellence_.
  True, my love is limited to the southern  provinces, with their medieval memories; for the progressive guttural  north I have little sympathy, but the Rhine claimed me from the first,  calling, calling, with that wonderful voice which speaks of death and  life, of chivalry and greed of gold.
  If you would have the rivers  company you should wander, a happy solitary, along its banks, watching  its gleaming current in the early morning, its golden glory as it answers  the farewell of parting day.
  Then, in the silence of the night, you can  hear the wash and eddy calling one to another, count the heart-beats of  the great bearer of burdens, and watch in the moonlight the sisters of  the mist as they lament with wringing hands the days that are gone.
    The forests, too, are ready with story hid in the fastness of their  solitude, and it is a joy to think that those great pines, pointing ever  upwards, go for the most part to carry the sails of great ships seeking  afar under open sky.
  The forest holds other wonders still.
  It seems but  last night that I wandered down the road which led to the little unheeded  village where I had made my temporary home.
  The warm-scented breath of  the pines and the stillness of the night wrapped me in great content; the  summer lightning leapt in a lambent arch across the east, and the stars,  seen dimly through the sombre tree crests, were outrivalled by the  glow-worms which shone in countless points of light from bank and hedge;  even two charcoal-burners, who passed with friendly greeting, had  wreathed their hats with the living flame.
  The tiny shifting lamps were  everywhere; pale yellow, purely white, or green as the underside of a  northern wave.
  By day but an ugly, repellent worm; but darkness comes,  and lo, a star alight.
  Nature is full for us of seeming inconsistencies  and glad surprises.
  The worlds asleep, say you; on your ear falls the  nightingales song and the stir of living creatures in bush and brake.
  The mantle of night falls, and all unattended the wind leaps up and  scatters the clouds which veil the constant stars; or in the hour of the  great dark, dawn parts the curtain with the long foregleam of the coming  day.
  It is hard to turn ones back on night with her kiss of peace for  tired eye-lids, the kiss which is not sleep but its neglected forerunner.
  I made my way at last down to the vine-girt bridge asleep under the stars  and up the winding stairs of the old grey tower; and a stones-throw away  the Rhine slipped quietly past in the midsummer moonlight.
  Switzerland  came in its turn, unearthly in its white loveliness and glory of lake and  sky.
  But perhaps the landmark which stands out most clearly is the  solitary blue gentian which I found in the short slippery grass of the  Rigi, gazing up at the sky whose blue could not hope to excel it.
  It was  my first; and what need of another, for finding one I had gazed into the  mystery of all.
  This side the Pass, snow and the blue of heaven; later I  entered Italy through fields of many-hued lilies, her past glories  blazoned in the flowers of the field.
    Now it is a strangely uneventful road that leads to my White Gate.
  Each  day questions me as it passes; each day makes answer for me not yet.
  There is no material preparation to be made for this journey of mine into  a far countrya simple fact which adds to the unknowableness of the  other side.
  Do I travel alone, or am I one of a great company, swift yet  unhurried in their passage?  The voices of Penelopes suitors shrilled on  the ears of Ulysses, as they journeyed to the nether-world, like  nocturnal birds and bats in the inarticulateness of their speech.
  They  had abused the gift, and fled self-condemned.
  Maybe silence commends  itself as most suitable for the wayfarers towards the sunrisesilence  because they seek the Wordbut for those hastening towards the confusion  they have wrought there falls already the sharp oncoming of the curse.
    While we are still here the language of worship seems far, and yet lies  very nigh; for what better note can our frail tongues lisp than the voice  of wind and sea, river and stream, those grateful servants giving all and  asking nothing, the soft whisper of snow and rain eager to replenish, or  the thunder proclaiming a majesty too great for utterance?  Here, too,  stands the angel with the censer gathering up the fragrance of teeming  earth and forest-tree, of flower and fruit, and sweetly pungent herb  distilled by sun and rain for joyful use.
  Here, too, come acolytes  lighting the dark with taperssun, moon, and starsgifts of the Lord that  His sanctuary may stand ever served.
    It lies here ready to our hand, this life of adoration which we needs  must live hand in hand with earth, for has she not borne the curse with  us?  But beyond the white gate and the trail of woodbine falls the  silence greater than speech, darkness greater than light, a pause of a  little while; and then the touch of that healing garment as we pass to  the King in His beauty, in a land from which there is no return.
    At the gateway then I cry you farewell.

    There is scarcely an UN-DRAMATIC writer of the Seventeenth Century,  whose poems exhibit so many and such gross corruptions as those  of the author of LUCASTA.
  In the present edition, which is the  first attempt to present the productions of a celebrated and  elegant poet to the admirers of this class of literature in a  readable shape, both the text and the pointing have been amended  throughout, the original reading being always given in the footnotes;  but some passages still remain, which I have not succeeded  in elucidating to my satisfaction, and one or two which have defied  all my attempts at emendation, though, as they stand, they are  unquestionably nonsense.
  It is proper to mention that several  rather bold corrections have been hazarded in the course of the  volume; but where this has been done, the deviation from the  original has invariably been pointed out in the notes.
    On the title-page of the copy of LUCASTA, 1649, preserved among  the King's Pamphlets in the British Museum, the original possessor  has, according to his usual practice, marked the date of purchase,  viz.
, June 21; perhaps, and indeed probably, that was also  the date of publication.
  A copy of LUCASTA, 1649, occasionally  appears in catalogues, purporting to have belonged to Anne,  Lady Lovelace; but the autograph which it contains was taken  from a copy of Massinger's BONDMAN (edit.
 1638, 4to.
), which her  Ladyship once owned.
  This copy of Lovelace's LUCASTA is bound up  with the copy of the POSTHUME POEMS, once in the possession  of Benjamin Rudyerd, Esq.
, grandson and heir of the distinguished  Sir Benjamin Rudyerd, as appears also from his autograph  on the title.
<1.
1>    In the original edition of the two parts of LUCASTA, 1649-59,  the arrangement of the poems appears, like that of the text,  to have been left to chance, and the result has been a total  absence of method.
  I have therefore felt it part of my duty to  systematise the contents of the volume, and, so far as it lay in my  power, to place the various pieces of which it consisted in their  proper order; all the odes, sonnets, &c.
 addressed or referring to  the lady who is concealed under the names of LUCASTA and AMARANTHA  have now been, for the first time, brought together; and the copies  of commendatory and gratulatory verses, with one exception prefixed  by Lovelace to various publications by friends during his life-time,  either prior to the appearance of the first part of his own  poems in 1649, or between that date and the issue of his Remains  ten years later, have been placed by themselves, as an act of  justice to the writer, of whose style and genius they are, as is  generally the case with all compositions of the kind, by no means  favourable specimens.
  The translations from Catullus, Ausonius,  &c.
 have been left as they stood; they are, for the most part,  destitute of merit; but as they were inserted by the Poet's  brother, when he edited the posthumous volume, I did not think it  right to disturb them, and they have been retained in their full  integrity.
    Lovelace's LUCASTA was included by the late S.
 W.
 Singer, Esq.
,  in his series of "Early English Poets;" but that gentleman,  besides striking out certain passages, which he, somewhat  unaccountably and inconsistently, regarded as indelicate,  omitted a good deal of preliminary matter in the form of  commendatory verses which, though possibly of small worth,  were necessary to render the book complete; it is possible,  that Mr. Singer made use of a copy of LUCASTA which was deficient  at the commencement.
  It may not be generally known that,  independently of its imperfections in other respects,  Mr. Singer's reprint abounds with the grossest blunders.
    The old orthography has been preserved intact in this edition;  but with respect to the employment of capitals, the entirely  arbitrary manner in which they are introduced into the book as  originally published, has made it necessary to reduce them, as well  as the singularly capricious punctuation, to modern rules.
  At the  same time, in those cases where capitals seemed more characteristic  or appropriate, they have been retained.
    It is a singular circumstance, that Mr. Singer (in common with  Wood, Bliss, Ellis, Headley, and all other biographers,) overlooked  the misprint of ARAMANTHA for AMARANTHA, which the old compositor  made, with one or two exceptions, wherever the word occurred.
  In  giving a correct representation of the original title-page, I have  been obliged to print ARAMANTHA.
    In the hope of discovering the exact date of Lovelace's birth  and baptism, I communicated with the Rev.
 A.
 J.
 Pearman, incumbent  of Bethersden, near Ashford, and that gentleman obligingly examined  the registers for me, but no traces of Lovelace's name are to be  found.

    Kensington, August 12, 1863.
    <1.
1> Mr. B.
 R.
 was a somewhat diligent collector of books,  both English and foreign.
  On the fly-leaves of his copy  of Rosse's MYSTAGOGUS POETICUS, 1648, 8vo.
, he has written  the names of a variety of works, of which he was at the time  seemingly in recent possession.
                                   BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE.
    With the exception of Sir Egerton Brydges, who contributed to the  GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE for 1791-2 a series of articles on the life  and writings of the subject of the present memoir, all the  biographers of Richard Lovelace have contented themselves with  following the account left by Anthony Wood of his short and unhappy  career.
  I do not think that I can do better than commence, at  least, by giving word for word the narrative of Wood in his own  language, to which I purpose to add such additional particulars in  the form of notes or otherwise, as I may be able to supply.
  But  the reader must not expect much that is new: for I regret to say  that, after the most careful researches, I have not improved, to  any large extent, the state of knowledge respecting this elegant  poet and unfortunate man.
    "Richard Lovelace," writes Wood, "the eldest son of Sir William  Lovelace<2.
1> of Woollidge in Kent, knight, was born in that  country [in 1618], educated in grammar learning in  Charterhouse<2.
2> School near London, became a gent.
 commoner of  Gloucester Hall in the beginning of the year 1634,<2.
3> and in that  of his age sixteen, being then accounted the most amiable and  beautiful person that ever eye beheld; a person also of innate  modesty, virtue, and courtly deportment, which made him then, but  especially after, when he retired to the great city, much admired  and adored by the female sex.
  In 1636, when the king and queen  were for some days entertained at Oxon, he was, at the request of a  great lady belonging to the queen, made to the Archbishop of  Canterbury [Laud], then Chancellor of the University, actually  created, among other persons of quality, Master of Arts, though but  of two years' standing; at which time his conversation being made  public, and consequently his ingenuity and generous soul  discovered, he became as much admired by the male, as before by the  female, sex.
  After he had left the University, he retired in great  splendour to the court, and being taken into the favour of Lord  George Goring, afterwards Earl of Norwich, was by him adopted a  soldier, and sent in the quality of an ensign, in the Scotch  expedition, an.
 1639.
  Afterwards, in the second expedition, he was  commissionated a captain in the same regiment, and in that time  wrote a tragedy called THE SOLDIER, but never acted, because the  stage was soon after suppressed.
  After the pacification of  Berwick, he retired to his native country, and took possession [of  his estate] at Lovelace Place, in the parish of Bethersden,<2.
4> at  Canterbury, Chart, Halden, &c.
, worth, at least, <pounds>500 per  annum.
  About which time he [being then on the commission of the  peace] was made choice of by the whole body of the county of Kent  at an assize, to deliver the Kentish petition<2.
5> to the House of  Commons, for the restoring the king to his rights, and for settling  the government, &c.
  For which piece of service he was committed  [April 30, 1642] to the Gatehouse at Westminster,<2.
6> where he  made that celebrated song called, STONE WALLS DO NOT A PRISON MAKE,  &c.
  After three or four months' [six or seven weeks'] imprisonment,  he had his liberty upon bail of <pounds>40,000 [<pounds>4000?]  not to stir out of the lines of communication without a pass from  the speaker.
  During the time of this confinement to London,  he lived beyond the income of his estate, either to keep up  the credit and reputation of the king's cause by furnishing  men with horses and arms, or by relieving ingenious men in want,  whether scholars, musicians, soldiers, &c.
  Also, by furnishing  his two brothers, Colonel Franc.
 Lovelace, and Captain William  Lovelace (afterwards slain at Caermarthen)<2.
7> with men and  money for the king's cause, and his other brother, called Dudley  Posthumus Lovelace, with moneys for his maintenance in Holland,  to study tactics and fortification in that school of war.
  After  the rendition of Oxford garrison, in 1646, he formed a regiment  for the service of the French king, was colonel of it, and  wounded at Dunkirk;<2.
8> and in 1648, returning into England, he,  with Dudley Posthumus before mentioned, then a captain under him,  were both committed prisoners to Peter House,<2.
9> in London, where  he framed his poems for the press, entitled, LUCASTA: EPODES, ODES,  SONNETS, SONGS, &c.
, Lond.
 1649, Oct.
  The reason why he gave that  title was because, some time before, he had made his amours to a  gentlewoman of great beauty and fortune, named Lucy Sacheverell,  whom he usually called LUX CASTA; but she, upon a stray report that  Lovelace was dead of his wound received at Dunkirk, soon after  married.
<2.
10>  He also wrote ARAMANTHA [Amarantha], A PASTORAL,  printed with LUCASTA.
<2.
11> Afterwards a musical composition of two  parts was set to part of it by Henry Lawes,<2.
12> sometimes servant  to king Charles I.
, in his public and private music.
    "After the murther of king Charles I.
 Lovelace was set at liberty,  and, having by that time consumed all his estate,<2.
13> grew  very melancholy (which brought him at length into a consumption),  became very poor in body and purse, was the object of charity,  went in ragged cloaths (whereas when he was in his glory he wore  cloth of gold and silver), and mostly lodged in obscure and dirty  places, more befitting the worst of beggars and poorest of  servants, &c.
  After his death his brother Dudley, before  mentioned, made a collection of his poetical papers, fitted them  for the press, and entitled them LUCASTA: POSTHUME POEMS, Lond.
  1659,<2.
14> Oct.
, the second part, with his picture before  them.
<2.
15>  These are all the things that he hath extant; those  that were never published were his tragedy, called THE SOLDIER or  SOLDIERS, before mentioned; and his comedy, called THE  SCHOLAR,<2.
16> which he composed at sixteen years of age, when he  came first to Gloucester hall, acted with applause afterwards in  Salisbury Court.
  He died in a very mean lodging in Gunpowder  Alley,<2.
17> near Shoe Lane,<2.
18> and was buried at the west-end  of the church of S.
 Bride, alias Bridget, in London, near to the  body of his kinsman Will.
 Lovelace, of Gray's Inn, Esq.
, in sixteen  hundred fifty and eight,<2.
19> having before been accounted by all  those that well knew him to have been a person well versed in the  Greek<2.
20> and Latin<2.
21> poets, in music, whether practical or  theoretical, instrumental or vocal, and in other things befitting a  gentleman.
  Some of the said persons have also added, in my  hearing, that his common discourse was not only significant and  witty, but incomparably graceful, which drew respect from all men  and women.
  Many other things I could now say of him, relating  either to his most generous mind in his prosperity, or dejected  estate in his worst state of poverty, but for brevity's sake I  shall now pass them by.
  At the end of his Posthume Poems are  several elegies written on him by eminent poets of that time,  wherein you may see his just character.
"    Such is Wood's account; it is to be regretted that that writer  did not supply the additional information, which he tantalizes us  by saying that he possessed, and could have published, had he not  been afraid of being tedious.
  His love of brevity is, in this  case, most provoking.
    As might be expected, the Journals of Parliament cast additional  light on the personal connexion of Lovelace with the Kentish  Petition of 1642, which was for the GENERAL redress of existing  grievances, not, as the editor of the VERNEY PAPERS seems to have  considered, merely for the adjustment of certain points relative to  the Militia.
  Parliamentary literature has not a very strong  fascination for the editors of old authors, and the biographers of  Lovelace have uniformly overlooked the mine of information which  lies in the LORDS' AND COMMONS' JOURNALS.
  The subject was  apparently introduced, for the first time, into Parliament on the  28th March, 1642, when a conference of both Houses took place,  respecting "a petition from Kent, which, praying for a Restoration  of the Bishops, Liturgy and Common Prayer, and other constitutional  measures, was voted seditious and against privilege and the peace  of the kingdom;" on the same occasion, Lord Bristol and Mr. Justice  Mallett were committed to the Tower for having in their possession  a copy of the document.
  On the 7th April it was ordered by both  Houses, that the Kentish Petition should be burned by the hands of  the common hangman.
    On the 28th April, the Commons acquainted the Upper House,  by Mr. Oliver Cromwell, "that a great meeting was to be held  next day on Blackheath, to back the rejected Kentish  Petition.
"<2.
22>    Two days later, a strange scene occurred at Westminster.
  Let the Commons' Journals tell the story in their own language:--    "30 April, 1642.
  The House being informed that divers gentlemen  of the county of Kent were at the door, that desired to present  a petition to the House;    "They were called in, presented their Petition, and withdrew.
    "And their Petition was read, and appeared to be the same  that was formerly burnt, by order of both Houses, by the hands  of the common hangman.
  Captain LEIGH reports that, being at  the Quarter Sessions held at MAIDSTONE, he observed certain  passages which he delivered in writing.
    "Captain Lovelace, who presented the Petition, was called in;  and Mr. Speaker was commanded to ask him, from whose hand  he had this Petition, and who gave him warrant to present it.
    "'Mr. GEO.
 CHUTE delivered him [he replied] the Petition the next  day after the Assizes.
'    "'The gentlemen [he continued], that were assembled at BLACKHEATH,  commanded him to deliver it.
'    "[The Speaker then inquired] whether he knew that the like was  burnt by the order of this House, and that some were here  questioned for the business.
    "'He understood a general rumour, that some gentlemen were  questioned.
    "'He had heard a fortnight since, that the like Petition was burned  by the hand of the common hangman.
    "'He knew nothing of the bundle of printed petitions.
'    "He likewise said, 'that there was a petition at the Quarter  Sessions, disavowed by all the Justices there, which he tore.
'    "Sir William Boteler was likewise called in, [and] asked when he  was at Yorke.
    "[He] answered, 'On Wednesday last was sevennight, he came from  Yorke, and came to his house in London.
    "'He heard of a petition that was never delivered.
    "'He never heard of any censure of the Parliament.
    "'He heard that a paper was burnt for being irregularly burnt  [?presented].
    "'He had heard that the Petition, that went under the name of  the Kentish Petition, was burnt by the hands of the common hangman.
    "'He never heard of any order of either, [or] of both, the Houses  concerning [the Petition].
    "'He was at Hull on Thursday or Friday was a sevennight: as he  came from Yorke, he took Hull in the way.
  He had heard, that  Sir Roger Twisden was questioned for the like Petition.
    "'He was yesterday at BLACKHEATH.
'    "Resolved, upon the question, that Captain Lovelace shall be  presently Committed prisoner to the Gatehouse.
    "Resolved, upon the question, that Sir William Boteler shall be  presently committed prisoner to the Fleet.
    "Ordered, that the sergeant shall apprehend them, and carry them  in safe custody, and deliver them as prisoners to the several  prisons aforesaid.
"    On the 4th May, 1642, the House of Commons ordered Mr. Whittlock  and others to prepare a charge against Mr. Lovelace and Sir William  Boteler with all expedition; but nothing further is heard of the  matter till the 17th June, When Lovelace<2.
23> and Boteler  petitioned the House separately for their release from custody.
  Hereupon Sir William was discharged on finding personal bail to the  extent of <pounds>10,000, with a surety for <pounds>5000; and in  the case of his companion in misfortune it was ordered, on the  question, that "he be forthwith bailed upon GOOD security.
"  This  "good security," surely, did not reach the sum mentioned by Wood,  namely, <pounds>40,000; but it is likely that the author of the  ATHENAE is ONLY wrong by a cypher, and that the amount fixed was  <pounds>4000, as it has been already suggested.
  Thus Lovelace's  confinement did not exceed seven weeks in duration, and the  probability, is that the sole inconvenience, which he subsequently  experienced, was the loss of the bail.
    The description left by Wood and Aubrey of the end of Lovelace  can only be reconciled with the fact, that his daughter and heiress  conveyed Kingsdown, Hever,<2.
24> and a moiety of Chipsted,  to the Cokes by marriage with Mr. Henry Coke, by presuming that  those manors were entailed; while Lovelace Place, as well perhaps  as Bayford and Goodneston, not being similarly secured, were sold  to defray the owner's incumbrances.
  At any rate it is not,  upon the whole, very probable that he died in a hovel, in a state  of absolute poverty;<2.
25> that he received a pound a week  (equal to about <pounds>4 of our money) from two friends,  Cotton and another, Aubrey himself admits; and we may rest  satisfied that, however painful the contrast may have been between  the opening and close of that career, the deplorable account given  in the ATHENAE, and in the so-called LIVES OF EMINENT MEN, is much  exaggerated and overdrawn.
    It has not hitherto been remarked, that among the Kentish gentry  who, from time to time, elected to change the nature of their  tenure from gavelkind to primogeniture, were the Lovelaces  themselves, in the person of Thomas Lovelace,<2.
26> who, by Act of  Parliament 2 and 3 Edw.
 VI.
 obtained, concurrently with several  other families, the power of conversion.
  This Thomas Lovelace was  not improbably the same, who was admitted a student of Gray's Inn  in 1541; and that he was of the Kentish Lovelaces there is not much  reason to doubt; although, at the same time, I am unable to fix the  precise degree of consanguinity between him and Serjeant William  Lovelace of Gray's Inn, who died in 1576, and who was great-grandfather  to the author of LUCASTA.
  The circumstance that the real property  of Thomas Lovelace aforesaid, situated in Kent, was released by Act  of Parliament, 2 and 3 Edw.
 VI.
 from the operations of gavelkind tenure  (assuming, as is most likely to have been the case, that he was of the  same stock as the poet, though not an immediate ancestor,) seems to  explain the following allusion by Dudley Lovelace in the verses  prefixed by him to LUCASTA, 1649:--        "Those by the landed have been writ,       Mine's but a younger-brother wit.
"    As well as the subjoined lines by Lovelace in the poem entitled,  "To Lucasta, from Prison," (see p.
 44 of present edition):--        "Next would I court my LIBERTY,       And then my birthright, PROPERTY.
"    There is evidence to prove that Lovelace was on intimate terms  with some of the wits of his time, and that he had friendly  relations with many of them--such as Hall, Rawlins, Lenton, and  particularly the Cottons.
  John Tatham, the City Poet, and author  of THE FANCIES THEATER, 1640, knew him well, and addressed to him  some stanzas, not devoid of merit, during his stay abroad.
  In 1643, Henry Glapthorne, a celebrated dramatist and poet  of the same age, dedicated to Lovelace his poem of WHITEHALL,  printed in that year in a quarto pamphlet, with elegies  on the Earls of Bedford and Manchester.
<2.
27>  The pages  of LUCASTA bear testimony to the acquaintance of the author  with Anthony Hodges of New College, Oxford, translator of  CLITOPHON AND LEUCIPPE from the Greek of Achilles Tatius  (or rather probably from a Latin version of the original),  and with other<2.
28> members of the University.
<2.
29>    Although it is stated by Wood that LUCASTA was prepared for the  press by Lovelace himself, on his return from the Continent in  1648, it is impossible to believe that any care was bestowed on the  correction of the text, or on the arrangement of the various pieces  which compose the volume: nor did his brother Dudley Posthumus, who  edited the second part of the book in 1659, perform his task in any  degree better.
  In both instances, the printer seems to have been  suffered to do the work in his own way, and very infamously he has  done it.
  To supply all the short-comings of the author and his  literary executor at this distance of time, is, unfortunately, out  of the power of any editor; but in the present republication I have  taken the liberty of rearranging the poems, to a certain extent in  the order in which it may be conjectured that they were written;  and where Lovelace contributed commendatory verses to other works,  either before or after the appearance of the first portion of  LUCASTA, the two texts have been collated, and improved readings  been occasionally obtained.
    The few poems, on which the fame of Lovelace may be said to rest,  are emanations not only of the stirring period in which he lived,  but of the peculiar circumstances into which he was thrown  at different epochs of his life.
  Lovelace had not the melodious  and exquisite taste of Herrick, the wit of Suckling, or the power  of Randolph (so often second only to his master Jonson).
  Mr. Singer has praised the exuberant fancy of Lovelace; but,  in my thinking, Lovelace was inferior in fancy, as well as in  grace, both to Carew and the author of HESPERIDES.
  Yet Lovelace  has left behind him one or two things, which I doubt if any of  those writers could have produced, and which our greatest poets  would not have been ashamed to own.
  Winstanley was so far right in  instituting a comparison between Lovelace and Sydney, that it is  hard to name any one in the entire circle of early English  literature except Sydney and Wither, who could have attempted, with  any chance of success, the SONG TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON; and how  differently Sydney at least would have handled it!  We know what  Herrick would have made of it; it would have furnished the theme  for one more invocation to Julia.
  From Suckling we should have had  a bantering playfulness, or a fescennine gaiety, equally unsuited  to the subject.
  Waller had once an opportunity of realizing the  position, which has been described by his contemporary in immortal  stanzas; but Waller, when he was under confinement, was thinking  too much of his neck to write verses with much felicity, and  preferred waiting, till he got back to Beaconsfield (when his  inspiration had evaporated), to pour out his feelings to Lady  Dorothy or Lady Sophia.
  Wither's song, "Shall I wasting in  Despair," is certainly superior to the SONG TO ALTHEA.
  Wither was  frequently equal to Lovelace in poetical imagery and sentiment, and  he far excelled him in versification.
  The versification of  Lovelace is indeed more rugged and unmusical than that of any other  writer of the period, and this blemish is so conspicuous throughout  LUCASTA, and is noticeable in so many cases, where it might have  been avoided with very little trouble, that we are naturally led to  the inference that Lovelace, in writing, accepted from indolence or  haste, the first word which happened to occur to his mind.
  Daniel,  Drayton, and others were, it is well known, indefatigable revisers  of their poems; they "added and altered many times," mostly  for the better, occasionally for the worse.
  We can scarcely  picture to ourselves Lovelace blotting a line, though it would  have been well for his reputation, if he had blotted many.
    In the poem of the LOOSE SARABAND (p.
 34) there is some resemblance  to a piece translated from Meleager in Elton's SPECIMENS OF CLASSIC  POETS, i.
 411, and entitled by Elton "Playing at Hearts.
"        "Love acts the tennis-player's part,       And throws to thee my panting heart;       Heliodora! ere it fall,       Let desire catch swift the ball:       Let her in the ball-court move,       Follow in the game with love.
       If thou throw me back again,       I shall of foul play complain.
"    And an address to the Cicada by the same writer, (IBID.
 i.
 415)  opens with these lines:--        "Oh, shrill-voiced insect that, with dew-drops sweet       Inebriate, dost in desert woodlands sing.
"    In the poem called "The Grasshopper" (p.
 94), the author speaks  of the insect as        "Drunk ev'ry night with a delicious tear,       Dropped thee from heaven.
"----    The similarity, in each case, I believe to have been entirely  accidental: nor am I disposed to think that Lovelace was under any  considerable or direct obligations to the classics.
  I have taken  occasion to remark that Lovelace seems to have helped to furnish  a model to Cleveland, who carried to an extraordinary length that  fondness for words and figures derived from the alchymist's  vocabulary; but as regards the author of LUCASTA himself, it may  be asserted that there are few writers whose productions exhibit  less of book-lore than his, and even in those places, where he has  employed phrases or images similar to some found in Peele,  Middleton, Herrick, and others, there is great room to question,  whether the circumstance can be treated as amounting to more than  a curious coincidence.
    The Master of Dulwich College has obligingly informed me,  that the picture of ALTHEA, as well as that of Lovelace himself,  bequeathed by Cartwright the actor to Dulwich College in 1687,  bears no clue to date of composition, or to the artist's name,  and that it does not assist in the identification of the lady.
  This is the more vexatious, inasmuch as it seems probable that  ALTHEA, whoever she was, became the poet's wife, after LUCASTA'S  marriage to another.
  The CHLOES, &c.
 mentioned in the following  pages were merely more or less intimate acquaintances of Lovelace,  like the ELECTRA, PERILLA, CORINNA, &c.
 of Herrick.
  But at the  same time an obscurity has hitherto hung over some of the persons  mentioned under fictitious names in the poems of Lovelace,  which a little research and trouble would have easily removed.
  For instance, no one who reads "Amarantha, a Pastoral,"  doubts that LUCASTA and AMARANTHA are one and the same person.
  ALEXIS is Lovelace himself.
  ELLINDA is a female friend of  the poet, who occasionally stayed at her house, and on one  occasion (p.
 79) had a serious illness there.
  ELLINDA marries  AMYNTOR, under which disguise, I suspect, lurks the well known  Maecenas of his time, Endymion Porter.
  If Porter be AMYNTOR, of  course ELLINDA must be the Lady Olivia Porter, his wife.
  ARIGO  (see the poem of AMYNTOR'S GROVE) signifies Porter's friend,  Henry Jermyn.
  It may be as well to add that the LETTICE mentioned  at p.
 121, was the Lady Lettice Goring, wife of Lovelace's friend,  and third daughter of Richard Boyle, first Earl of Cork.
  This lady  died before her husband, to whom she brought no issue.
    The following lines are prefixed to FONS LACHRYMARUM, &c.
  by John Quarles, 1648, 8vo.
, and are subscribed, as will be seen,  R.
 L.
; they may be from the pen of Lovelace; but, if so,  it is strange that they were not admitted, with other productions  of a similar character, into the volume published by the poet  himself in 1649, or into that edited by his brother in 1659.
                       TO MY DEAR FRIEND THE AUTHOR.
         The Son begins to rise, the Father's set:       Heav'n took away one light, and pleas'd to let       Another rise.
  Quarles, thy light's divine,       And it shall teach Darkness it self to shine.
       Each word revives thy Father's name, his art       Is well imprinted in thy noble heart.
       I've read thy pleasing lines, wherein I find       The rare Endeavors of a modest mind.
       Proceed as well as thou hast well begun,       That we may see the Father by the Son.

    The above has been partly derived from a communication to the  GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE for Dec.
 1791, by Sir Egerton Brydges,  who chiefly compiled it from Hasted, compared with Berry's  KENT GENEALOGIES, 474, where there are a few inaccuracies.
  It is, of course, a mere skeleton-tree, and furnishes no  information as to the collateral branches, the connexion between  the houses of Stanley and Lovelace, &c.
  Sir Egerton Brydges'  series of articles on Lovelace in the GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE, with  the exception of that from which the foregoing table is taken,  does not contain much, if anything, that is new.
  On the 3rd of  May, 1577, Henry Binneman paid "vi<pence> and a copie" to the  Stationers' Company for the right to print "the Briefe Course of  the Accidents of the Deathe of Mr. Serjeant Lovelace;" and on the  30th of August following, Richard Jones obtained a licence to print  "A Short Epitaphe of Serjeant Lovelace.
" This was the same person  who is described in the pedigree as dying in 1576.
  His death  happened, no doubt, like that of Sir Robert Bell and others, at the  Oxford Summer assizes for 1576.
  See Stow's ANNALES, fol.

    Sir William Lovelace, the poet's grandfather who, according to  Berry, died in 1629, was a correspondent of Sir Dudley Carleton  (see CALENDARS OF STATE PAPERS, DOMESTIC SERIES, 1611-18, pp.
 443,  521, 533; Ibid.
 1618-23, p.
 17).
  It appears from some Latin lines  before the first portion of LUCASTA, that the poet's father served  with distinction in Holland, and probably it was this circumstance  which led to Lovelace himself turning his attention in a similar  direction: for the latter was on service in the Low Countries,  perhaps under his father (of whose death we do not know the date,  though Hasted intimates that he fell at the Gryll), when his friend  Tatham, afterwards the city poet, addressed to him some verses  printed in a volume entitled OSTELLA (printed in 1650).
    <2.
2> Mr. A.
 Keightley, Registrar of the Charterhouse, with his  usual kindness, examined for me the books of the institution,  in the hope of finding the date of Lovelace's admission, &c.
,  but without success.
  Mr. Keightley has suggested to me that  perhaps Lovelace was not on the foundation, which is of course  highly probable, and which, as Mr. Keightley seems to think,  may account for the omission of his name from the registers.

4> Bethersden is a parish in the Weald of Kent, eastward  of Smarden, near Surrenden.
  "The manor of Lovelace," says Hasted  (HISTORY OF KENT, iii.
 239), "is situated at a very small distance  SOUTH-WESTWARD from the church [of Bethersden].
  It was in early  times the property of a family named Grunsted, or Greenstreet,  as they were sometimes called; the last of whom, HENRY DE GRUNSTED,  a man of eminent repute, as all the records of this county testify,  in the reigns of both King Edward II.
 and III.
, passed away this  manor to KINET, in which name it did not remain long; for WILLIAM  KINET, in the 41st year of King Edward III.
, conveyed it by sale  to JOHN LOVELACE, who erected that mansion here, which from hence  bore his name in addition, being afterwards styled BETHERSDEN-LOVELACE,  from which sprang a race of gentlemen, who, in the  military line, acquired great reputation and honour, and by their  knowledge in the municipal laws, deserved well of the Commonwealth;  from whom descended those of this name seated at BAYFORD in  SITTINGBORNE, and at KINGSDOWN in this county, the Lords Lovelace  of Hurley, and others of the county of Berks.
" The same writer,  in his HISTORY OF CANTERBURY, has preserved many memorials  of the connexion of the Lovelaces from the earliest times  with Canterbury and its neighbourhood.
  William Lovelace,  in the reign of Philip and Mary, died possessed of the mansion  belonging to the abbey of St.
 Lawrence, near Canterbury;  after the death of his son William, it passed to other hands.
  In 1621, Lancelot Lovelace, Esq.
, was Recorder of Canterbury;  in 1638, Richard Lovelace, Esq.
, held that office; and in the  year of the Restoration, Richard Lovelace, the poet's brother, was  Recorder.
  In the Public Library at Plymouth, there is a folio MS.
  (mentioned in Mr. Halliwell's catalogue, 1853), containing  "Original Papers of the Molineux and LOVELACE Families.
" I regret  that I have not had an opportunity of inspecting it.
  Mr. Halliwell  does not seem to have examined the volume; at all events, that  gentleman does not furnish any particulars as to the nature of the  contents, or as to the period to which the papers belong.
  This  information, in the case of a MS.
 deposited in a provincial library  in a remote district, would have been peculiarly valuable.
  It is  possible that the documents refer only to the Lovelaces of Hurley,  co.
 Berks.

5> "The Humble Petition of the Gentry, Ministers, and  Commonalty, for the county of Kent, agreed upon at the General  Assizes for that county.
" See JOURNALS OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS, iv.
  675-6-7.
  The "framers and contrivers" of this petition were Sir  Edward Dering, Bart.
, of Surrenden-Dering; Sir Roger Twysden, the  well-known scholar; Sir George Strode, and Mr. Richard Spencer.
  On  the 21st May, 1641, Dering had unsuccessfully attempted to bring in  a bill for the ABOLITION of church government by bishops,  archbishops, &c.
, whereas one of the articles of the petition of  1642 (usually known as DERING'S PETITION) was a prayer for the  restoration of the Liturgy and the maintenance of the episcopal  bench in its integrity.
  A numerously signed petition had also  been addressed to both Houses by the county in 1641, in which  the strongest reasons were given for the adoption of Dering's  proposed act.
  From 1641 to 1648, indeed, the Houses were  overwhelmed by Kentish petitions of various kinds.
  This portion  of Wood's narrative is confirmed by Marvell's lines prefixed to  LUCASTA, 1649:--        "And one the Book prohibits, because Kent       Their first Petition by the Authour sent.
"    "Sir William Boteler, of Kent, returning about the beginning of  APRIL 1642, from his attendance (being then Gentleman Pentioner)  on the king at YORKE, then celebrating St.
 GEORGE'S feast,  was by the earnest solicitation of the Gentry of Kent ingaged  to joyn with them in presenting the most honest and famous Petition  of theirs to the House of Commons, delivered by Captain RICHARD  LOVELACE, for which service the Captain was committed Prisoner to  the GATE HOUSE, and SIR WILLIAM BOTELER to the Fleet, from whence,  after some weeks close imprisonment, no impeachment in all that  time brought in against him [Boteler], many Petitions being  delivered and read in the House for his inlargement, he was at last  upon bail of <pounds>20,000 [<pounds>15,000] remitted to his house  in LONDON, to attend DE DIE IN DIEM the pleasure of the House.
"--MERCURIUS  RUSTICUS, 1646 (edit.
 1685, pp.
 7, 8).
  The fact was  that, although on the 7th of April, 1642, the Kentish petition in  favour of the Liturgy, &c.
 had been ordered by the House of Commons  to be burned by the common hangman (PARLIAMENTS AND COUNCILS  OF ENGLAND, 1839, p.
 384), Boteler and Lovelace had the temerity,  on the 30th of the same month, to come up to London, and present it  again to the House.
  It was this which occasioned their committal.
  In the VERNEY PAPERS (Camd.
 Soc.
 1845, p.
 175) there is the  following memorandum:--        "Captaine Lovelace committed to the Gatehouse     !  Concerning       Sir William Butler committed to the Fleete       !  Deering's                                                        !  petition.

      UPON MY NOBLE FRIEND RICHARD LOVELACE, ESQ.
, HIS            BEING IN HOLLAND.
 AN INVITATION.
         Come, Adonis, come again;         What distaste could drive thee hence,       Where so much delight did reign,         Sateing ev'n the soul of sense?       And though thou unkind hast prov'd,       Never youth was more belov'd.
         Then, lov'd Adonis, come away,         For Venus brooks not thy delay.
         Wert thou sated with the spoil         Of so many virgin hearts,       And therefore didst change thy soil,         To seek fresh in other parts?       Dangers wait on foreign game;       We have deer more sound and tame.
         Then, lov'd Adonis, come away,         For Venus brooks not thy delay.
         Phillis, fed with thy delights,         In thy absence pines away;       And love, too, hath lost his rites,         Not one lass keeps holiday.
       They have changed their mirth for cares,       And do onely sigh thy airs.
         Then, lov'd Adonis, come away,         For Venus brooks not thy delay.
         Elpine, in whose sager looks         Thou wert wont to take delight,       Hath forsook his drink and books,         'Cause he can't enjoy thy sight:       He hath laid his learning by,       'Cause his wit wants company.
         Then, lov'd Adonis, come away,         For friendship brooks not thy delay.
         All the swains that once did use         To converse with Love and thee,       In the language of thy Muse,         Have forgot Love's deity:       They deny to write a line,       And do only talk of thine.
         Then, lov'd Adonis, come away,         For friendship brooks not thy delay.
         By thy sweet Althea's voice,         We conjure thee to return;       Or we'll rob thee of that choice,         In whose flames each heart would burn:       That inspir'd by her and sack,       Such company we will not lack:         That poets in the age to come,        Shall write of our Elisium.

9> Peter, or rather PETRE House, in Aldersgate Street,  belonged at one time to the antient family by whose name it was  known.
  The third Lord Petre, dying in 1638, left it, with other  possessions in and about the city of London, to his son William.
  (Collins's PEERAGE, by Brydges, vii.
 10, 11.
)  When Lovelace was  committed to Peter House, and probably long before (MERCURIUS  RUSTICUS, ed.
 1685, pp.
 76-79), this mansion was used as a house of  detention for political prisoners; but in Ward's DIARY (ed.
 Severn,  p.
 167), there is the following entry (like almost all Ward's  entries, unluckily without date):--"My Lord Peters is an Essex man;  hee hath a house in Aldersgate Street, wherein lives the Marquis  of Dorchester:" implying that at that period (perhaps about 1660),  the premises still belonged to the Petre family, though temporarily  let to Lord Dorchester.
  Another celebrated house in the same  street was London House, which continued for some time to be the  town residence of the Bishops of London.
  When it had ceased to be  an episcopal abode, it was adapted to the purposes of an ordinary  dwelling, and, among the occupants, at a somewhat later period, was  Tom Rawlinson, the great book-collector.

    <2.
10> How different was the conduct, under similar circumstances,  of the lady whom Charles Gerbier commemorates in his ELOGIUM  HEROINUM, 1651, p.
 127.
 "Democion, the Athenian virgin," he tells  us, "hearing that Leosthenes, to whom she was contracted, was slain  in the wars, she killed herself; but before her death she thus  reasoned with herself: 'Although my body is untoucht, yet should I  fall into the imbraces of another, I should but deceive the second,  since I am still married to the former in my heart.
'"    <2.
11> Wood's story about LUCASTA having been a Lucy Sacheverell,  "a lady of great beauty and fortune," may reasonably be doubted.
  Lucasta, whoever she was, seems to have belonged to Kent;  the SACHEVERELLS were not a Kentish family.
  Besides, the  corruption of Lucy Sacheverell into Lucasta is not very obvious,  and rather violent; and the probability is that the author of  the ATHENAE was misled by his informant on this occasion.
  The plate etched by Lely and engraved by Faithorne, which  is found in the second part of LUCASTA, 1659, can scarcely  be regarded as a portrait; it was, in all likelihood, a mere  fancy sketch, and we are not perhaps far from the truth in our  surmise that the artist was nearly, if not quite, as much  in the dark as to who Lucasta was, as we are ourselves  at the present day.
    <2.
12> This is a mistake on the part of Wood, which (with many  others) ought to be corrected in a new edition of the ATHENAE.
  Lawes did not set to music AMARANTHA, A PASTORAL, nor any portion  of it; but he harmonized two stanzas of a little poem to be found  at p.
 29 of the present volume, and called "To Amarantha; that she  would dishevel her Hair.
"    <2.
13> Hasted states that soon after the death of Charles I.
 the  manor of Lovelace-Bethersden passed by purchase to Richard Hulse,  Esq.
    <2.
14> On the title-page of this portion of LUCASTA, as well as  on that which had appeared in 1649, the author is expressly styled  RICHARD LOVELACE, ESQ.
: yet in Berry's KENT GENEALOGIES, p.
 474,  he is, curiously enough, called SIR Richard Lovelace, KNT.
  It is  scarcely necessary to observe that the error is on Berry's side.
    <2.
15> The most pleasing likeness of Lovelace, the only one,  indeed, which conveys any just idea to us of the "handsomest man of  his time," is the picture at Dulwich, which has been twice copied,  in both instances with very indifferent success.
  One of these  copies was made for Harding's BIOGRAPHICAL MIRROR.
  Bromley  (DICTIONARY OF ENGRAVED BRITISH PORTRAITS, 1793, p.
 101) correctly  names F[rancis] Lovelace, the writer's brother, as the designer  of the portrait before the POSTHUME POEMS.
    <2.
16> Winstanley, perhaps, intended some allusion to these two  lost dramas from the pen of Lovelace, when he thus characterizes  him in his LIVES OF THE POETS, 1687, p.
 170:--"I can compare no  man," he says, "so like this Colonel LOVELACE as SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,  of which latter it is said by one in an epitaph made of him:--        'Nor is it fit that more I should acquaint,         Lest men adore in one       A Scholar, SOULDIER, Lover, and a Saint.
'"    As to the comparison, Winstanley must be understood to signify  a resemblance between Lovelace and Sydney as men, rather than  as writers.
  Winstanley's extract is from WITS' RECREATIONS,  but the text, as he gives it, varies from that printed by  the editor of the reprint of that work in 1817.
    <2.
17> Gunpowder Alley still exists, but it is not the Gunpowder  Alley which Lovelace knew, having been rebuilt more than once  since 1658, It is now a tolerably wide and airy court, without  any conspicuous appearance of squalor.
  There is no tradition,  I am sorry to say, respecting Lovelace; all such recollections  have long been swept away.
  When one of the old inhabitants  told me (and there are one or two persons who have lived here  all their life) that a great poet once resided thereabout,  I naturally became eager to catch the name; but it turned out  to be Dr.
 Johnson, not Lovelace, the latter of whom might have  been contemporary with Homer for aught they knew to the contrary  in Gunpowder Alley.
  It appears from Decker and Webster's play  of WESTWARD HOE, 1607 (Webster's Works, ed.
 Hazlitt, i.
 67),  that there was another Gunpowder Alley, near Crutched Friars.
    <2.
18> Hone (EVERY-DAY BOOK, ii.
 561, edit.
 1827), states,  under date of April 28, that "during this month in 1658  the accomplished Colonel Richard Lovelace died IN THE GATEHOUSE  AT WESTMINSTER, whither he had been committed," &c.
  No authority,  however, is given for in assertion so wholly at variance with  the received view on the subject, and I am afraid that Hone has  here fallen into a mistake.
    <2.
19> Aubrey, in what are called his LIVES OF EMINENT MEN,  but which are, in fact, merely rough biographical memoranda,  states under the head of Lovelace:--"Obiit in a cellar in  Long acre, a little before the restauration of his Matie.
  Mr. Edm.

"  Aubrey was certainly a contemporary of Lovelace, and Wood seems  to have been indebted to him for a good deal of information;  but all who are acquainted with Aubrey are probably aware that  he took, in many instances, very little trouble to examine for  himself, but accepted statements on hearsay.
  Wood does not,  in the case of Lovelace, adopt Aubrey's account, and it is to  be observed that, IF the poet died as poor as he is represented  by both writers to have died, he would have been buried by the  parish, and, dying in Long Acre, the parochial authorities would  not have carried him to Fleet Street for sepulture.

  He is, no doubt, the E.

  He was evidently a person of the most benevolent  character, and Aubrey (LIVES OF EMINENT MEN, ii.

27> As so little is known of the personal history of Lovelace,  the reader may not be displeased to see this Dedication, and it is  therefore subjoined:--        "To my Noble Friend And Gossip, CAPTAIN RICHARD LOVELACE.
      "Sir,      "I have so long beene in your debt that I am almost desperate       in my selfe of making you paiment, till this fancy by       ravishing from you a new curtesie in its patronage, promised       me it would satisfie part of my former engagements to you.
       Wonder not to see it invade you thus on the sudden; gratitude       is aeriall, and, like that element, nimble in its motion and       performance; though I would not have this of mine of a French       disposition, to charge hotly and retreat unfortunately: there       may appeare something in this that may maintaine the field       courageously against Envy, nay come off with honour; if you,       Sir, please to rest satisfied that it marches under your       ensignes, which are the desires of           "Your true honourer,                "Hen.
 Glapthorne.
"    <2.
28> It has never, so far as I am aware, been suggested that  the friend to whom Sir John Suckling addressed his capital ballad:--        "I tell thee, Dick, where I have been,"    may have been Lovelace.
  It was a very usual practice (then even  more so than now) among familiar acquaintances to use the  abbreviated Christian name in addressing each other; thus Suckling  was JACK; Davenant, WILL; Carew, TOM, &c.
; in the preceding  generation Marlowe had been KIT; Jonson, BEN; Greene, ROBIN, and so  forth; and although there is no positive proof that Lovelace and  Suckling were intimate, it is extremely probable that such was the  case, more especially as they were not only brother poets, but both  country gentlemen belonging to neighbouring counties.
  Suckling  had, besides, some taste and aptitude for military affairs, and  could discourse about strategics in a city tavern over a bowl of  canary with the author of LUCASTA, notwithstanding that he was a  little troubled by nervousness (according to report), when the  enemy was too near.
    <2.
29> From Andrew Marvell's lines prefixed to LUCASTA, 1649,  it seems that Lovelace and himself were on tolerably good terms,  and that when the former presented the Kentish petition, and was  imprisoned for so doing, his friends, who exerted themselves to  procure his release, suspected Marvell of a share in his disgrace,  which Marvell, according to his own account, earnestly disclaimed.
  See the lines commencing:--        "But when the beauteous ladies came to know," &c.

                       VERSES ADDRESSED TO THE AUTHOR.
               TO MY BEST BROTHER ON HIS POEMS CALLED "LUCASTA.
"    Now y' have oblieg'd the age, thy wel known worth  Is to our joy auspiciously brought forth.
  Good morrow to thy son, thy first borne flame  Which, as thou gav'st it birth, stamps it a name,  That Fate and a discerning age shall set  The chiefest jewell in her coronet.
    Why then needs all this paines, those season'd pens,  That standing lifeguard to a booke (kinde friends),  That with officious care thus guard thy gate,  As if thy Child were illigitimate?  Forgive their freedome, since unto their praise  They write to give, not to dispute thy bayes.
    As when some glorious queen, whose pregnant wombe  Brings forth a kingdome with her first-borne Sonne,  Marke but the subjects joyfull hearts and eyes:  Some offer gold, and others sacrifice;  This slayes a lambe, that, not so rich as hee,  Brings but a dove, this but a bended knee;  And though their giftes be various, yet their sence  Speaks only this one thought, Long live the prince.
    So, my best brother, if unto your name  I offer up a thin blew-burning flame,  Pardon my love, since none can make thee shine,  Vnlesse they kindle first their torch at thine.
  Then as inspir'd, they boldly write, nay that,  Which their amazed lights but twinkl'd at,  And their illustrate thoughts doe voice this right,  Lucasta held their torch; thou gav'st it light.

    How humble is thy muse (Deare) that can daign  Such servants as my pen to entertaine!  When all the sonnes of wit glory to be  Clad in thy muses gallant livery.
  I shall disgrace my master, prove a staine,  And no addition to his honour'd traine;  Though all that read me will presume to swear  I neer read thee: yet if it may appear,  I love the writer and admire the writ,  I my owne want betray, not wrong thy wit.
  Did thy worke want a prayse, my barren brain  Could not afford it: my attempt were vaine.

 JOHN PINCHBACK, COL[ONEL].
  Pinchback neither is nor was, I believe, a name of common  occurrence; and it is just possible that the Colonel may be the  very "old Jack Pinchbacke" mentioned by Sir Nicholas L'Estrange,  in his MERRY PASSAGES AND JESTS, of which a selection was given  by Mr. Thoms in his ANECDOTES AND TRADITIONS, 1839.
  L'Estrange,  it is true, describes the Colonel as a "gamester and rufler,  daubed with gold lace;" but this is not incompatible with the  identity between the PINCHBACKE, who figures in LUCASTA, and  OLD JACK, who had perhaps not always been "a gamester and ruffler,"  and whose gold lace had, no doubt, once been in better company than  that which he seems to have frequented, when L'Estrange knew him.
  The "daubed gold lace," after all, only corresponds with the  picture, which Lovelace himself may have presented in GUNPOWDER  ALLEY days.

 RICHARD LOVELACE, ON HIS POEMS.
    He that doth paint the beauties of your verse,  Must use your pensil, be polite, soft, terse;  Forgive that man whose best of art is love,  If he no equall master to you prove.
  My heart is all my eloquence, and that  Speaks sharp affection, when my words fall flat;  I reade you like my mistresse, and discry  In every line the quicknesse of her eye:  Her smoothnesse in each syllable, her grace  To marshall ev'ry word in the right place.
  It is the excellence and soule of wit,  When ev'ry thing is free as well as fit:  For metaphors packt up and crowded close  Swath <ye> minds sweetnes, and display the throws,  And, like those chickens hatcht in furnaces,  Produce or one limbe more, or one limbe lesse  Then nature bids.
  Survey such when they write,  No clause but's justl'd with an epithite.
  So powerfully you draw when you perswade,  Passions in you in us are vertues made;  Such is the magick of that lawfull shell  That where it doth but talke, it doth compell:    For no Apelles 'till this time e're drew    A Venus to the waste so well as you.

        The world shall now no longer mourne nor vex  For th' obliquity of a cross-grain'd sex;  Nor beauty swell above her bankes, (and made  For ornament) the universe invade  So fiercely, that 'tis question'd in our bookes,  Whether kils most the Amazon's sword or lookes.
  Lucasta in loves game discreetly makes  Women and men joyntly to share the stakes,  And lets us know, when women scorne, it is  Mens hot love makes the antiparisthesis;  And a lay lover here such comfort finds  As Holy Writ gives to affected minds.

  Sir Thomas Overbury, in his CHARACTERS, represents  a chambermaid as carried away by the perusal of it into the realms  of romance, insomuch that she can barely refrain from forsaking  her occupation, and turning lady-errant.
  The book is better known  under the title of THE MIRROR OF PRINCELY DEEDES AND KNIGHTHOOD,  wherein is shewed the worthinesse of the Knight of the Sunne, &c.
  It consists of nine parts, which appear to have been published  at intervals between 1585 and 1601.

    SIR,    Ovr times are much degenerate from those,  Which your sweet Muse, which your fair fortune chose;  And as complexions alter with the climes,  Our wits have drawne th' infection of our times.

    The ayre's already tainted with the swarms  Of insects, which against you rise in arms.
  Word-peckers, paper-rats, book-scorpions,  Of wit corrupted the unfashion'd sons.
  The barbed censurers begin to looke  Like the grim Consistory on thy booke;  And on each line cast a reforming eye  Severer then the yong presbytery.

    But when the beauteous ladies came to know,  That their deare Lovelace was endanger'd so:  Lovelace, that thaw'd the most congealed brest,  He who lov'd best, and them defended best,  Whose hand so rudely grasps the steely brand,  Whose hand so gently melts the ladies hand,  They all in mutiny, though yet undrest,  Sally'd, and would in his defence contest.
  And one, the loveliest that was yet e're seen,  Thinking that I too of the rout had been,  Mine eyes invaded with a female spight  (She knew what pain 't would be to lose that sight).
  O no, mistake not, I reply'd: for I  In your defence, or in his cause, would dy.
  But he, secure of glory and of time,  Above their envy or mine aid doth clime.
  Him valianst men and fairest nymphs approve,  His booke in them finds judgement, with you, love.

 Marvell             TO COLONEL RICHARD LOVELACE,  ON THE PUBLISHING OF HIS INGENIOUS POEMS.
      If the desire of glory speak a mind  More nobly operative and more refin'd,  What vast soule moves thee, or what hero's spirit  (Kept in'ts traduction pure) dost thou inherit,  That, not contented with one single fame,  Dost to a double glory spread thy name,  And on thy happy temples safely set  Both th' Delphick wreath and civic coronet?    Was't not enough for us to know how far  Thou couldst in season suffer, act and dare  But we must also witnesse, with what height  And what Ionick sweetnesse thou canst write,  And melt those eager passions, that are  Stubborn enough t' enrage the god of war  Into a noble love, which may expire<9.
1>  In an illustrious pyramid of fire;  Which, having gained his due station, may  Fix there, and everlasting flames display.
  This is the braver path: time soone can smother  The dear-bought spoils and tropheis of the other.
  How many fiery heroes have there been,  Whose triumphs were as soone forgot as seen?  Because they wanted some diviner one  To rescue <thee> from night, and make <thee> known.
    Such art thou to thy selfe.
  While others dream  Strong flatt'ries on a fain'd or borrow'd theam,  Thou shalt remaine in thine owne lustre bright,  And adde unto 't LUCASTA'S chaster light.
    For none so fit to sing great things as he,  That can act o're all lights of poetry.

         TO THE HONORABLE, VALIANT, AND INGENIOUS COLONEL RICHARD LOVELACE,                        ON HIS EXQUISITE POEMS.
      Poets and painters have some near relation,  Compar'd with fancy and imagination;  The one paints shadowed persons (in pure kind),  The other paints the pictures of the mind  In purer verse.
  And as rare Zeuxes fame  Shin'd, till Apelles art eclips'd the same  By a more exquisite and curious line  In Zeuxeses (with pensill far more fine),  So have our modern poets late done well,  Till thine appear'd (which scarce have paralel).
    They like to Zeuxes grapes beguile the sense,  But thine do ravish the intelligence,  Like the rare banquet of Apelles, drawn,  And covered over with most curious lawn.
    Thus if thy careles draughts are cal'd the best,  What would thy lines have beene, had'st thou profest  That faculty (infus'd) of poetry,  Which adds such honour unto thy chivalry?  Doubtles thy verse had all as far transcended  As Sydneyes Prose, who Poets once defended.
    For when I read thy much renowned pen,  My fancy there finds out another Ben  In thy brave language, judgement, wit, and art,  Of every piece of thine, in every part:  Where thy seraphique Sydneyan fire is raised high  In valour, vertue, love, and loyalty.
    Virgil was styl'd the loftiest of all,  Ovid the smoothest and most naturall;  Martiall concise and witty, quaint and pure,  Iuvenall grave and learned, though obscure.
    But all these rare ones which I heere reherse,  Do live againe in Thee, and in thy Verse:  Although not in the language of their time,  Yet in a speech as copious and sublime.
    The rare Apelles in thy picture wee  Perceive, and in thy soule Apollo see.
  Wel may each Grace and Muse then crown thy praise  With Mars his banner and Minerva's bayes.

    If to be absent were to be        Away from thee;      Or that when I am gone,      You or I were alone;  Then my LUCASTA might I crave  Pity from blustring winde or swallowing wave.
                        II.
    But I'le not sigh one blast or gale        To swell my saile,      Or pay a teare to swage      The foaming blew-gods rage;  For whether he will let me passe  Or no, I'm still as happy as I was.
                        III.
    Though seas and land betwixt us both,        Our faith and troth,      Like separated soules,      All time and space controules:  Above the highest sphere wee meet,  Unseene, unknowne, and greet as angels greet                        IV.
    So then we doe anticipate        Our after-fate,      And are alive i'th' skies,      If thus our lips and eyes  Can speake like spirits unconfin'd  In Heav'n, their earthy bodies left behind.

                        III.
  Yet this inconstancy is such,    As you too shall adore;  I could not love thee, dear, so much,    Lov'd I not Honour more.

                        IV.
  Then as a top he sets it up,    And pitifully whips it;  Sometimes he cloathes it gay and fine,    Then straight againe he strips it.
                        V.
  He cover'd it with false reliefe,<20.
4>    Which gloriously show'd it;  And for a morning-cushionet    On's mother he bestow'd it.
                        VI.
  Each day, with her small brazen stings,    A thousand times she rac'd it;  But then at night, bright with her gemmes,    Once neere her breast she plac'd it.
                        VII.
  There warme it gan to throb and bleed;    She knew that smart, and grieved;  At length this poore condemned heart    With these rich drugges repreeved.
                        VIII.
  She washt the wound with a fresh teare,    Which my LUCASTA dropped,  And in the sleave<20.
5>-silke of her haire    'Twas hard bound up and wrapped.
                        IX.
  She proab'd it with her constancie,    And found no rancor nigh it;  Only the anger of her eye    Had wrought some proud flesh by it.
                        X.
  Then prest she narde in ev'ry veine,    Which from her kisses trilled;  And with the balme heald all its paine,    That from her hand distilled.
                        XI.
  But yet this heart avoyds me still,    Will not by me be owned;  But's fled to its physitian's breast;    There proudly sits inthroned.

<25.
1>                        I.
  Long in thy shackels, liberty  I ask not from these walls, but thee;  Left for awhile anothers bride,  To fancy all the world beside.
                        II.
  Yet e're I doe begin to love,  See, how I all my objects prove;  Then my free soule to that confine,  'Twere possible I might call mine.
                        III.
  First I would be in love with PEACE,  And her rich swelling breasts increase;  But how, alas! how may that be,  Despising earth, she will love me?                        IV.
  Faine would I be in love with WAR,  As my deare just avenging star;  But War is lov'd so ev'rywhere,  Ev'n he disdaines a lodging here.
                        V.
  Thee and thy wounds I would bemoane,  Faire thorough-shot RELIGION;  But he lives only that kills thee,  And who so bindes thy hands, is free.
                        VI.
  I would love a PARLIAMENT  As a maine prop from Heav'n sent;  But ah! who's he, that would be wedded  To th' fairest body that's beheaded?                        VII.
  Next would I court my LIBERTY,  And then my birth-right, PROPERTY;  But can that be, when it is knowne,  There's nothing you can call your owne?                        VIII.
  A REFORMATION I would have,  As for our griefes a SOV'RAIGNE salve;  That is, a cleansing of each wheele  Of state, that yet some rust doth feele.
                        IX.
  But not a reformation so,  As to reforme were to ore'throw,  Like watches by unskilfull men  Disjoynted, and set ill againe.
                        X.
  The PUBLICK FAITH<25.
2> I would adore,  But she is banke-rupt of her store:  Nor how to trust her can I see,  For she that couzens all, must me.
                        XI.
  Since then none of these can be  Fit objects for my love and me;  What then remaines, but th' only spring  Of all our loves and joyes, the King?                        XII.
  He who, being the whole ball  Of day on earth, lends it to all;  When seeking to ecclipse his right,  Blinded we stand in our owne light.
                        XIII.
  And now an universall mist  Of error is spread or'e each breast,  With such a fury edg'd as is  Not found in th' inwards of th' abysse.
                        XIV.
  Oh, from thy glorious starry waine  Dispense on me one sacred beame,  To light me where I soone may see  How to serve you, and you trust me!    <25.
1> This was written, perhaps, during the poet's confinement  in Peterhouse, to which he was committed a prisoner on his return  from abroad in 1648.
  At the date of its composition, there can be  little doubt, from expressions in stanzas vi.
 and xii.
 that the  fortunes of Charles I.
 were at their lowest ebb, and it may be  assigned without much risk of error to the end of 1648.

                        V.
  But whilst a plumy curtaine she doth draw,    A chrystall mirror sparkles in thy breast,  In which her fresh aspect when as she saw,    And then her foe<26.

  Deare engine, that oth' sun got'st me the day,    'Spite of his hot assaults mad'st him retreat!  No wind (said she) dare with thee henceforth play    But mine own breath to coole the tyrants heat.
                        VII.
  My lively shade thou ever shalt retaine    In thy inclosed feather-framed glasse,  And but unto our selves to all remaine    Invisible, thou feature of this face!                        VIII.
  So said, her sad swaine over-heard and cried:    Yee Gods! for faith unstaind this a reward!  Feathers and glasse t'outweigh my vertue tryed!    Ah! show their empty strength! the gods accord.
                        IX.
  Now fall'n the brittle favourite lyes and burst!    Amas'd LUCASTA weepes, repents and flies  To her ALEXIS, vowes her selfe acurst,    If hence she dresse her selfe but in his eyes.

  Mr. Fairholt, in his COSTUME IN ENGLAND,  1846, p.

  But as through th' Organs of her breath    You trickle wantonly, beware:  Ambitious Seas in their just death    As well as Lovers, must have share.
                        VI.
  And see! you boyle as well as I;    You, that to coole her did aspire,  Now troubled and neglected lye,    Nor can your selves quench your owne fire.
                        VII.
  Yet still be happy in the thought,    That in so small a time as this,  Through all the Heavens you were brought    Of Vertue, Honour, Love and Blisse.
    <27.
1> From this it might be conjectured, though the ground for  doing so would be very slight, that LUCASTA was a native of Kent  or of one of the adjoining shires; but against this supposition  we have to set the circumstance that elsewhere this lady is called  a "northern star.

  Ah LUCASTA, why so chaste?  With that vigour, ripenes grac't,  Not to be by Man imbrac't  Makes that Royall coyne imbace't,  And this golden Orchard waste!                        III.
  Ah LUCASTA, why so great,  That thy crammed coffers sweat?  Yet not owner of a seat  May shelter you from Natures heat,  And your earthly joyes compleat.
                        IV.
  Ah Lucasta, why so good?  Blest with an unstained flood  Flowing both through soule and blood;  If it be not understood,  'Tis a Diamond in mud.
                        V.
  LUCASTA! stay! why dost thou flye?  Thou art not bright but to the eye,  Nor chaste but in the mariage-tye,  Nor great but in this treasurie,  Nor good but in that sanctitie.
                        VI.
  Harder then the Orient stone,  Like an apparition,  Or as a pale shadow gone,  Dumbe and deafe she hence is flowne.
                        VII.
  Then receive this equall dombe:  Virgins, strow no teare or bloome,  No one dig the Parian wombe;  Raise her marble heart i'th' roome,  And 'tis both her coarse and tombe.

  Griefe ne're before did tyranize    On th' honour of that brow,  And at the wheeles of her brave eyes    Was captive led til now.

  Thus, for a saints apostacy    The unimagin'd woes  And sorrowes of the Hierarchy    None but an angel knowes.

                     LUCASTA'S WORLD.
                    EPODE.
                        I.
  Cold as the breath of winds that blow  To silver shot descending snow,    Lucasta sigh't;<30.
1> when she did close      The world in frosty chaines!    And then a frowne to rubies frose      The blood boyl'd in our veines:  Yet cooled not the heat her sphere  Of beauties first had kindled there.
                        II.
  Then mov'd, and with a suddaine flame  Impatient to melt all againe,    Straight from her eyes she lightning hurl'd,      And earth in ashes mournes;    The sun his blaze denies the world,      And in her luster burnes:  Yet warmed not the hearts, her nice  Disdaine had first congeal'd to ice.
                        III.
  And now her teares nor griev'd desire  Can quench this raging, pleasing fire;    Fate but one way allowes; behold      Her smiles' divinity!    They fann'd this heat, and thaw'd that cold,      So fram'd up a new sky.
  Thus earth, from flames and ice repreev'd,  E're since hath in her sun-shine liv'd.
    <30.

          THE APOSTACY OF ONE, AND BUT ONE LADY.
                        I.
  That frantick errour I adore,    And am confirm'd the earth turns round;  Now satisfied o're and o're,    As rowling waves, so flowes the ground,  And as her neighbour reels the shore:    Finde such a woman says she loves;    She's that fixt heav'n, which never moves.
                        II.
  In marble, steele, or porphyrie,    Who carves or stampes his armes or face,  Lookes it by rust or storme must dye:    This womans love no time can raze,  Hardned like ice in the sun's eye,    Or your reflection in a glasse,    Which keepes possession, though you passe.
                        III.
  We not behold a watches hand    To stir, nor plants or flowers to grow;  Must we infer that this doth stand,    And therefore, that those do not blow?  This she acts calmer, like Heav'ns brand,    The stedfast lightning, slow loves dart,    She kils, but ere we feele the smart.
                        IV.
  Oh, she is constant as the winde,    That revels in an ev'nings aire!  Certaine as wayes unto the blinde,    More reall then her flatt'ries are;  Gentle as chaines that honour binde,    More faithfull then an Hebrew Jew,    But as the divel not halfe so true.

2>                          A DIALOGUE.
                            Amyntor.
           Alexis! ah Alexis! can it be,               Though so much wet and drie                   Doth drowne our eye,             Thou keep'st thy winged voice from me?                             Alexis.
           Amyntor, a profounder sea, I feare,               Hath swallow'd me, where now                   My armes do row,             I floate i'th' ocean of a teare.
             Lucasta weepes, lest I look back and tread               Your Watry land againe.
  Amyn.
            I'd through the raine;             Such showrs are quickly over-spread.
             Conceive how joy, after this short divorce,               Will circle her with beames,                   When, like your streames,             You shall rowle back with kinder force,             And call the helping winds to vent your thought.
  Alex.
        Amyntor! Chloris! where                   Or in what sphere             Say, may that glorious fair be sought?    Amyn.
    She's now the center of these armes e're blest,               Whence may she never move,                   Till Time and Love             Haste to their everlasting rest.
    Alex.
    Ah subtile swaine! doth not my flame rise high               As yours, and burne as hot?                   Am not I shot             With the selfe same artillery?             And can I breath without her air?--Amyn.
                     Why, then,               From thy tempestuous earth,                   Where blood and dearth             Raigne 'stead of kings, agen             Wafte thy selfe over, and lest storms from far               Arise, bring in our sight                   The seas delight,             Lucasta, that bright northerne star.
    Alex.
    But as we cut the rugged deepe, I feare               The green god stops his fell                   Chariot of shell,             And smooths the maine to ravish her.
    Amyn.
    Oh no, the prince of waters' fires are done;               He as his empire's old,                   And rivers, cold;             His queen now runs abed to th' sun;             But all his treasure he shall ope' that day:               Tritons shall sound: his fleete                   In silver meete,             And to her their rich offrings pay.
    Alex.
    We flye, Amyntor, not amaz'd how sent               By water, earth, or aire:                   Or if with her                   By fire: ev'n there             I move in mine owne element.

  From the dire monument of thy black roome,  Wher now that vestal flame thou dost intombe,  As in the inmost cell of all earths wombe.
                        II.
  Sacred Lucasta, like the pow'rfull ray  Of heavenly truth, passe this Cimmerian way,  Whilst all the standards of your beames display.

  Arise and climbe our whitest, highest hill;  There your sad thoughts with joy and wonder fill,  And see seas calme<32.

                        IV.
  Behold! how lightning like a taper flyes,  And guilds your chari't, but ashamed dyes,  Seeing it selfe out-gloried by your eyes.
                        V.
  Threatning and boystrous tempests gently bow,  And to your steps part in soft paths, when now  There no where hangs a cloud, but on your brow.

                    AMARANTHA.
           A PASTORALL.
<33.
1>      Up with the jolly bird of light  Who sounds his third retreat to night;  Faire Amarantha from her bed  Ashamed starts, and rises red  As the carnation-mantled morne,  Who now the blushing robe doth spurne,  And puts on angry gray, whilst she,  The envy of a deity,  Arayes her limbes, too rich indeed  To be inshrin'd in such a weed;  Yet lovely 'twas and strait, but fit;  Not made for her, but she to it:  By nature it sate close and free,  As the just bark unto the tree:  Unlike Love's martyrs of the towne,  All day imprison'd in a gown,  Who, rackt in silke 'stead of a dresse,  Are cloathed in a frame or presse,  And with that liberty and room,  The dead expatiate in a tombe.
    No cabinets with curious washes,  Bladders and perfumed plashes;  No venome-temper'd water's here,  Mercury is banished this sphere:  Her payle's all this, in which wet glasse  She both doth cleanse and view her face.
    Far hence, all Iberian smells,  Hot amulets, Pomander spells,  Fragrant gales, cool ay'r, the fresh  And naturall odour of her flesh,  Proclaim her sweet from th' wombe as morne.
  Those colour'd things were made, not borne.
  Which, fixt within their narrow straits,  Do looke like their own counterfeyts.
  So like the Provance rose she walkt,  Flowerd with blush, with verdure stalkt;  Th' officious wind her loose hayre curles,  The dewe her happy linnen purles,  But wets a tresse, which instantly  Sol with a crisping beame doth dry.
    Into the garden is she come,  Love and delight's Elisium;  If ever earth show'd all her store,  View her discolourd budding floore;  Here her glad eye she largely feedes,  And stands 'mongst them, as they 'mong weeds;  The flowers in their best aray  As to their queen their tribute pay,  And freely to her lap proscribe  A daughter out of ev'ry tribe.
  Thus as she moves, they all bequeath  At once the incense of their breath.
    The noble Heliotropian  Now turnes to her, and knowes no sun.
    And as her glorious face doth vary,  So opens loyall golden Mary<33.
2>  Who, if but glanced from her sight,  Straight shuts again, as it were night.
  The violet (else lost ith' heap)  Doth spread fresh purple for each step,  With whose humility possest,  Sh' inthrones the Poore Girle<33.
3> in her breast:  The July-flow'r<33.
4> that hereto thriv'd,  Knowing her self no longer-liv'd,  But for one look of her upheaves,  Then 'stead of teares straight sheds her leaves.
    Now the rich robed Tulip who,  Clad all in tissue close, doth woe  Her (sweet to th' eye but smelling sower),  She gathers to adorn her bower.
    But the proud Hony-suckle spreads  Like a pavilion her heads,  Contemnes the wanting commonalty,  That but to two ends usefull be,  And to her lips thus aptly plac't,  With smell and hue presents her tast.
    So all their due obedience pay,  Each thronging to be in her way:  Faire Amarantha with her eye  Thanks those that live, which else would dye:  The rest, in silken fetters bound,  By crowning her are crown and crown'd.
<33.
5>    And now the sun doth higher rise,  Our Flora to the meadow hies:  The poore distressed heifers low,  And as sh' approacheth gently bow,  Begging her charitable leasure  To strip them of their milkie treasure.
    Out of the yeomanry oth' heard,  With grave aspect, and feet prepar'd,  A rev'rend lady-cow drawes neare,  Bids Amarantha welcome here;  And from her privy purse lets fall  A pearle or two, which seeme[s] to call  This adorn'd adored fayry  To the banquet of her dayry.
    Soft Amarantha weeps to see  'Mongst men such inhumanitie,  That those, who do receive in hay,  And pay in silver<33.
6> twice a day,  Should by their cruell barb'rous theft  Be both of that and life bereft.
    But 'tis decreed, when ere this dies,  That she shall fall a sacrifice  Unto the gods, since those, that trace  Her stemme, show 'tis a god-like race,  Descending in an even line  From heifers and from steeres divine,  Making the honour'd extract full  In Io and Europa's bull.
  She was the largest goodliest beast,  That ever mead or altar blest;  Round [w]as her udder, and more white  Then is the Milkie Way in night;  Her full broad eye did sparkle fire;  Her breath was sweet as kind desire,  And in her beauteous crescent shone,  Bright as the argent-horned moone.
    But see! this whiteness is obscure,  Cynthia spotted, she impure;  Her body writheld,<33.
7> and her eyes  Departing lights at obsequies:  Her lowing hot to the fresh gale,  Her breath perfumes the field withall;  To those two suns that ever shine,  To those plump parts she doth inshrine,  To th' hovering snow of either hand,  That love and cruelty command.
    After the breakfast on her teat,  She takes her leave oth' mournfull neat  Who, by her toucht, now prizeth her<33.
8> life,  Worthy alone the hollowed knife.
    Into the neighbring wood she's gone,  Whose roofe defies the tell-tale Sunne,  And locks out ev'ry prying beame;  Close by the lips of a cleare streame,  She sits and entertaines her eye  With the moist chrystall and the frye<33.
9>  With burnisht-silver mal'd, whose oares<33.
10>  Amazed still make to the shoares;  What need she other bait or charm,  What hook<33.
11> or angle, but her arm?  The happy captive, gladly ta'n,  Sues ever to be slave in vaine,  Who instantly (confirm'd in's feares)  Hasts to his element of teares.
    From hence her various windings roave  To a well-orderd stately grove;  This is the pallace of the wood  And court oth' Royall Oake, where stood  The whole nobility: the Pine,  Strait Ash, tall Firre, and wanton Vine;  The proper Cedar, and the rest.
  Here she her deeper senses blest;  Admires great Nature in this pile,  Floor'd with greene-velvet Camomile,  Garnisht with gems of unset fruit,  Supply'd still with a self recruit;  Her bosom wrought with pretty eyes  Of never-planted Strawberries;  Where th' winged musick of the ayre  Do richly feast, and for their fare,  Each evening in a silent shade,  Bestow a gratefull serenade.
    Thus ev'n tyerd with delight,  Sated in soul and appetite;  Full of the purple Plumme and Peare,  The golden Apple, with the faire  Grape that mirth fain would have taught her,  And nuts, which squirrells cracking brought her;  She softly layes her weary limbs,  Whilst gentle slumber now beginnes  To draw the curtaines of her eye;  When straight awakend with a crie  And bitter groan, again reposes,  Again a deep sigh interposes.
  And now she heares a trembling voyce:  Ah! can there ought on earth rejoyce!  Why weares she this gay livery,  Not black as her dark entrails be?  Can trees be green, and to the ay'r  Thus prostitute their flowing hayr?  Why do they sprout, not witherd dy?  Must each thing live, save wretched I?  Can dayes triumph in blew and red,  When both their light and life is fled?  Fly Joy on wings of Popinjayes  To courts of fools, where<33.
12> as your playes  Dye laught at and forgot; whilst all  That's good mourns at this funerall.
  Weep, all ye Graces, and you sweet  Quire, that at the hill inspir'd meet:  Love, put thy tapers out, that we  And th' world may seem as blind as thee;  And be, since she is lost (ah wound!)  Not Heav'n it self by any found.
    Now as a prisoner new cast,<33.
13>  Who sleepes in chaines that night, his last,  Next morn is wak't with a repreeve,  And from his trance, not dream bid live,  Wonders (his sence not having scope)  Who speaks, his friend or his false hope.
    So Amarantha heard, but feare  Dares not yet trust her tempting care;  And as againe her arms oth' ground  Spread pillows for her head, a sound  More dismall makes a swift divorce,  And starts her thus:----Rage, rapine, force!  Ye blew-flam'd daughters oth' abysse,  Bring all your snakes, here let them hisse;  Let not a leaf its freshnesse keep;  Blast all their roots, and as you creepe,  And leave behind your deadly slime,  Poyson the budding branch in's prime:  Wast the proud bowers of this grove,  That fiends may dwell in it, and move  As in their proper hell, whilst she  Above laments this tragedy:  Yet pities not our fate; oh faire  Vow-breaker, now betroth'd to th' ay'r!  Why by those lawes did we not die,  As live but one, Lucasta! why----  As he Lucasta nam'd, a groan  Strangles the fainting passing tone;  But as she heard, Lucasta smiles,  Posses<33.
14> her round; she's slipt mean whiles  Behind the blind of a thick bush,  When, each word temp'ring with a blush,  She gently thus bespake; Sad swaine,  If mates in woe do ease our pain,  Here's one full of that antick grief,  Which stifled would for ever live,  But told, expires; pray then, reveale  (To show our wound is half to heale),  What mortall nymph or deity  Bewail you thus?  Who ere you be,  The shepheard sigh't,<33.
15> my woes I crave  Smotherd in me, me<33.
16> in my grave;  Yet be in show or truth a saint,  Or fiend, breath anthemes, heare my plaint,  For her and thy breath's symphony,  Which now makes full the harmony  Above, and to whose voice the spheres  Listen, and call her musick theirs;  This was I blest on earth with, so  As Druids amorous did grow,  Jealous of both: for as one day  This star, as yet but set in clay,  By an imbracing river lay,  They steept her in the hollowed brooke,  Which from her humane nature tooke,  And straight to heaven with winged feare,<33.
17>  Thus, ravisht with her, ravish her.
    The nymph reply'd: This holy rape  Became the gods, whose obscure shape  They cloth'd with light, whilst ill you grieve  Your better life should ever live,  And weep that she, to whom you wish  What heav'n could give, has all its blisse.
  Calling her angell here, yet be  Sad at this true divinity:  She's for the altar, not the skies,  Whom first you crowne, then sacrifice.
    Fond man thus to a precipice  Aspires, till at the top his eyes  Have lost the safety of the plain,  Then begs of Fate the vales againe.
    The now confounded shepheard cries:  Ye all-confounding destines!  How did you make that voice so sweet  Without that glorious form to it?  Thou sacred spirit of my deare,  Where e're thou hoverst o're us, hear!  Imbark thee in the lawrell tree,  And a new Phebus follows thee,  Who, 'stead of all his burning rayes,  Will strive to catch thee with his layes;  Or, if within the Orient Vine,  Thou art both deity and wine;  But if thou takest the mirtle grove,  That Paphos is, thou, Queene of Love,  And I, thy swain who (else) must die,  By no beasts, but thy cruelty:  But you are rougher than the winde.
  Are souls on earth then heav'n<33.
18> more kind?  Imprisoned in mortality  Lucasta would have answered me.
  Lucasta, Amarantha said,  Is she that virgin-star? a maid,  Except her prouder livery,  In beauty poore, and cheap as I;  Whose glory like a meteor shone,  Or aery apparition,  Admir'd a while, but slighted known.
    Fierce, as the chafed lyon hies,  He rowses him, and to her flies,  Thinking to answer with his speare----    Now, as in warre intestine where,  Ith' mist of a black battell, each  Layes at his next, then makes a breach  Through th' entrayles of another, whom  He sees nor knows whence he did come,  Guided alone by rage and th' drumme,  But stripping and impatient wild,  He finds too soon his onely child.
    So our expiring desp'rate lover  Far'd when, amaz'd, he did discover  Lucasta in this nymph; his sinne  Darts the accursed javelin  'Gainst his own breast, which she puts by  With a soft lip and gentle eye,  Then closes with him on the ground  And now her smiles have heal'd his wound.
  Alexis too again is found;  But not untill those heavy crimes  She hath kis'd off a thousand times,  Who not contented with this pain,  Doth threaten to offend again.
    And now they gaze, and sigh, and weep,  Whilst each cheek doth the other's steep,  Whilst tongues, as exorcis'd, are calm;  Onely the rhet'rick of the palm  Prevailing pleads, untill at last  They[re] chain'd in one another fast.
  Lucasta to him doth relate  Her various chance and diffring fate:  How chac'd by Hydraphil, and tract  The num'rous foe to Philanact,  Who whilst they for the same things fight,  As Bards decrees and Druids rite,  For safeguard of their proper joyes  And shepheards freedome, each destroyes  The glory of this Sicilie;  Since seeking thus the remedie,  They fancy (building on false ground)  The means must them and it confound,  Yet are resolved to stand or fall,  And win a little, or lose all.
    From this sad storm of fire and blood  She fled to this yet living wood;  Where she 'mongst savage beasts doth find  Her self more safe then humane<33.
19> kind.
    Then she relates, how Caelia--<33.
20>  The lady--here strippes her array,  And girdles her in home-spunne bayes  Then makes her conversant in layes  Of birds, and swaines more innocent,  That kenne not guile [n]or courtship ment.
    Now walks she to her bow'r to dine  Under a shade of Eglantine,  Upon a dish of Natures cheere  Which both grew, drest and serv'd up there:  That done, she feasts her smell with po'ses  Pluckt from the damask cloath of Roses.
  Which there continually doth stay,  And onely frost can take away;  Then wagers which hath most content  Her eye, eare, hand, her gust or sent.
    Intranc't Alexis sees and heares,  As walking above all the spheres:  Knows and adores this, and is wilde,<33.
21>  Untill with her he live thus milde.
<33.
22>  So that, which to his thoughts he meant  For losse of her a punishment,  His armes hung up and his sword broke,  His ensignes folded, he betook  Himself unto the humble crook.
  And for a full reward of all,  She now doth him her shepheard call,  And in a see of flow'rs install:  Then gives her faith immediately,  Which he returns religiously;  Both vowing in her peacefull cave  To make their bridall-bed and grave.
    But the true joy this pair conceiv'd,  Each from the other first bereav'd,  And then found, after such alarmes,  Fast-pinion'd in each other's armes,  Ye panting virgins, that do meet  Your loves within their winding sheet,  Breathing and constant still ev'n there;  Or souls their bodies in yon' sphere,  Or angels, men return'd from hell  And separated mindes--can tell.

          TO ELLINDA, THAT LATELY I HAVE NOT WRITTEN.
                        I.
  If in me anger, or disdaine  In you, or both, made me refraine  From th' noble intercourse of verse,  That only vertuous thoughts rehearse;    Then, chaste Ellinda, might you feare    The sacred vowes that I did sweare.
                        II.
  But if alone some pious thought  Me to an inward sadnesse brought,  Thinking to breath your soule too welle,  My tongue was charmed with that spell;    And left it (since there was no roome    To voyce your worth enough) strooke dumbe.
                        III.
  So then this silence doth reveal  No thought of negligence, but zeal:  For, as in adoration,  This is love's true devotion;    Children and fools the words repeat,    But anch'rites pray in tears and sweat.

                        II.
  But grieve not, pretty Ermin cabinet,      Thy alabaster lady will come home;      If not, what tenant can there fit  The slender turnings of thy narrow roome,  But must ejected be by his owne dombe?<34.

  In the address  of "The Country Suiter to his Love," printed in Cotgrave's WITS  INTERPRETER, 1662, p.
 119, the man says:--        "Fair Wench!  I cannot court thy sprightly eyes       With a base-viol plac'd betwixt my thighs,       I cannot lisp, nor to a fiddle sing,       Nor run upon a high-strecht minikin.
"    In Middleton's FAMILIE OF LOVE, 1608 (Works by Dyce, ii.
 127)  there is the following passage:--        "GUDGEON.
    Ay, and to all that forswear marriage, and can be                   content with other men's wives.
       GERARDINE.
  Of which consort you two are grounds; one touches                   the bass, and the other tickles the minikin.
"                     BEING TREATED.
                TO ELLINDA.

  Thankes for my visit not disdaining,  Or at the least thankes for your feigning;  For if your mercy doore were lockt-well,  I should be justly soundly knockt-well;  Cause that in dogrell I did mutter  Not one rhime to you from dam-Rotter.
<35.
7>      Next beg I to present my duty  To pregnant sister in prime beauty,  Whom well I deeme (e're few months elder)  Will take out Hans from pretty Kelder,  And to the sweetly fayre Mabella,  A match that vies with Arabella;  In each respect but the misfortune,  Fortune, Fate, I thee importune.
      Nor must I passe the lovely Alice,  Whose health I'd quaffe in golden chalice;  But since that Fate hath made me neuter,  I only can in beaker pewter:  But who'd forget, or yet left un-sung  The doughty acts of George the yong-son?  Who yesterday to save his sister  Had slaine the snake, had he not mist her:  But I shall leave him, 'till a nag on  He gets to prosecute the dragon;  And then with helpe of sun and taper,  Fill with his deeds twelve reames of paper,  That Amadis,<35.

    <35.
1> This expression has reference to the old practice  of drinking beer and wine out of very high glasses, with  divisions marked on them.
  A yard of ale is even now a well  understood term: nor is the custom itself out of date, since  in some parts of the country one is asked to take, not a glass,  but A YARD.
  The ell was of course, strictly speaking, a larger  measure than a yard; but it was often employed as a mere synonyme  or equivalent.
  Thus, in MAROCCUS EXTATICUS, 1595, Bankes says:--  "Measure, Marocco, nay, nay, they that take up commodities make no  difference for measure between a Flemish elle and an English yard.
"    <35.
2> In the new edition of Nares (1859), this very passage is  quoted to illustrate the meaning of the word, which is defined  rather vaguely to be A CASK.
  Obviously the word signifies  something of the kind, but the explanation does not at all satisfy  me.
  I suspect that a flute OF CANARY was so called from the cask  having several vent-holes, in the same way that the French call a  lamprey FLEUTE D'ALEMAN from the fish having little holes in the  upper part of its body.
    <35.
3> Forsyth, in his ANTIQUARY'S PORTFOLIO, 1825, mentions  certain "glutton-feasts," which used formerly to be celebrated  periodically in honour of the Virgin; perhaps the pasties used on  these occasions were thence christened PASTIES-MARY.
    <35.
4> Venison pies or pasties were the most favourite dish in  this country in former times; innumerable illustrations might be  furnished of the high esteem in which this description of viand  was held by our ancestors, who regarded it as a thoroughly English  luxury.
  The anonymous author of HORAE SUBSECIVAE, 1620, p.
 38  (this volume is supposed to have been written by Giles Brydges,  Lord Chandos), describes an affected Englishman who has been  travelling on the Continent, as "sweating at the sight of a pasty  of venison," and as "swearing that the only delicacies be  mushrooms, or CAVIARE, or snayles.
"       "The full-cram'd dishes made the table crack,      Gammons of bacon, brawn, and what was chief,      King in all feasts, a tall Sir Loyne of BEEF,      Fat venison pasties smoaking, 'tis no fable,      Swans in their broath came swimming to the table.

                       TO ELLINDA.
           VPON HIS LATE RECOVERY.
                 A PARADOX.
                        I.
  How I grieve that I am well!    All my health was in my sicknes,  Go then, Destiny, and tell,    Very death is in this quicknes.
                        II.
  Such a fate rules over me,    That I glory when I languish,  And do blesse the remedy,    That doth feed, not quench my anguish.
                        III.
  'Twas a gentle warmth that ceas'd    In the vizard of a feavor;  But I feare now I am eas'd    All the flames, since I must leave her.
                        IV.
  Joyes, though witherd, circled me,    When unto her voice inured  Like those who, by harmony,    Only can be throughly cured.
                        V.
  Sweet, sure, was that malady,    Whilst the pleasant angel hover'd,  Which ceasing they are all, as I,    Angry that they are recover'd.
                        VI.
  And as men in hospitals,    That are maim'd, are lodg'd and dined;  But when once their danger fals,    Ah th' are healed to be pined!                        VII.
  Fainting so, I might before    Sometime have the leave to hand her,  But lusty, am beat out of dore,    And for Love compell'd to wander.
          TO CHLOE, COURTING HER FOR HIS FRIEND.
                        I.
  Chloe, behold! againe I bowe:  Againe possest, againe I woe;    From my heat hath taken fire    Damas, noble youth, and fries,<36.
1>    Gazing with one of mine eyes,    Damas, halfe of me expires:  Chloe, behold!  Our fate's the same.
  Or make me cinders too, or quench his flame                        II.
  I'd not be King, unlesse there sate  Lesse lords that shar'd with me in state    Who, by their cheaper coronets, know,    What glories from my diadem flow:    Its use and rate<36.
2> values the gem:    Pearles in their shells have no esteem;  And, I being sun within thy sphere,  'Tis my chiefe beauty thinner lights shine there.
                        III.
  The Us'rer heaps unto his store  By seeing others praise it more;    Who not for gaine or want doth covet,    But, 'cause another loves, doth love it:    Thus gluttons cloy'd afresh invite    Their gusts from some new appetite;  And after cloth remov'd, and meate,  Fall too againe by seeing others eate.

              GRATIANA DAUNCING AND SINGING.
                        I.
  See! with what constant motion  Even and glorious, as the sunne,    Gratiana steeres that noble frame,  Soft as her breast, sweet as her voyce,  That gave each winding law and poyze,    And swifter then the wings of Fame.
                        II.
  She beat the happy pavement  By such a starre-made firmament,    Which now no more the roofe envies;  But swells up high with Atlas ev'n,  Bearing the brighter, nobler Heav'n,    And in her, all the Dieties.
                        III.
  Each step trod out a lovers thought  And the ambitious hopes he brought,    Chain'd to her brave feet with such arts,  Such sweet command and gentle awe,  As when she ceas'd, we sighing saw     The floore lay pav'd with broken hearts.
                        IV.
  So did she move: so did she sing:  Like the harmonious spheres that bring    Unto their rounds their musick's ayd;  Which she performed such a way,  As all th' inamour'd world will say:    The Graces daunced, and Apollo play'd.

      It was<37.
3> Amyntor's Grove, that Chloris  For ever ecchoes, and her glories;  Chloris, the gentlest sheapherdesse,  That ever lawnes and lambes did blesse;  Her breath, like to the whispering winde,  Was calme as thought, sweet as her minde;  Her lips like coral gates kept in  The perfume and<37.
4> the pearle within;  Her eyes a double-flaming torch  That alwayes shine, and never scorch;  Her<37.
5> selfe the Heav'n in which did meet  The all of bright, of faire and sweet.
    Here was I brought with that delight  That seperated soules take flight;  And when my reason call'd my sence  Back somewhat from this excellence,  That I could see, I did begin  T' observe the curious ordering  Of every roome, where 'ts hard to know,  Which most excels in sent or show.
  Arabian gummes do breathe here forth,  And th' East's come over to the North;  The windes have brought their hyre<37.

    Now every saint cleerly divine,  Is clos'd so in her severall shrine;  The gems so rarely, richly set,  For them wee love the cabinet;  So intricately plac't withall,  As if th' imbrordered the wall,  So that the pictures seem'd to be  But one continued tapistrie.
<37.
12>    After this travell of mine eyes  We sate, and pitied Dieties;  Wee bound our loose hayre with the vine,  The poppy, and the eglantine;  One swell'd an oriental bowle  Full, as a grateful, loyal soule  To Chloris!  Chloris!  Heare, oh, heare!  'Tis pledg'd above in ev'ry sphere.
    Now streight the Indians richest prize  Is kindled in<37.
13> glad sacrifice;  Cloudes are sent up on wings of thyme,  Amber, pomgranates, jessemine,  And through our earthen conduicts sore  Higher then altars fum'd before.
    So drencht we our oppressing cares,  And choakt the wide jawes of our feares.
  Whilst ravisht thus we did devise,  If this were not a Paradice  In all, except these harmlesse sins:  Behold! flew in two cherubins,  Cleare as the skye from whence they came,  And brighter than the sacred flame;  The boy adorn'd with modesty,  Yet armed so with majesty,  That if the Thunderer againe  His eagle sends, she stoops in vaine.
<37.
14>  Besides his innocence he tooke  A sword and casket, and did looke  Like Love in armes; he wrote but five,  Yet spake eighteene; each grace did strive,  And twenty Cupids thronged forth,  Who first should shew his prettier worth.
  But oh, the Nymph!  Did you ere know  Carnation mingled with snow?<37.
15>  Or have you seene the lightning shrowd,  And straight breake through th' opposing cloud?  So ran her blood; such was its hue;  So through her vayle her bright haire flew,  And yet its glory did appeare  But thinne, because her eyes were neere.
    Blooming boy, and blossoming mayd,  May your faire sprigges be neere betray'd  To<37.
16> eating worme or fouler storme;  No serpent lurke to do them harme;  No sharpe frost cut, no North-winde teare,  The verdure of that fragrant hayre;  But<37.
17> may the sun and gentle weather,  When you are both growne ripe together,  Load you with fruit, such as your Father  From you with all the joyes doth gather:  And may you, when one branch is dead,  Graft such another in its stead,  Lasting thus ever in your prime,  'Till th' sithe is snatcht away from Time.

2> ARIGO or ARRIGO is the Venetian form of HENRICO.
  I have no  means of identifying CHLORIS or GRATIANA; but AMYNTOR was probably,  as I have already suggested, Endymion Porter, and ARIGO was  unquestionably no other than Henry Jermyn, or Jarmin, who, though  no poet, was, like his friend Porter, a liberal and discerning  patron of men of letters.

I will un-God that toye! cri'd she;  Then markt she SYRINX running fast  To Pan's imbraces, with the haste  Shee fled him once, whose reede-pipe rent  He finds now a new Instrument.
  THESEUS return'd invokes the Ayre  And windes, then wafts his faire;  Whilst ARIADNE ravish't stood  Half in his armes, halfe in the flood.
    Proud ANAXERETE doth fall  At IPHIS feete, who smiles at<39.
2> all:  And he (whilst she his curles doth deck)  Hangs no where now, but on her neck.
  Here PHOEBUS with a beame untombes  Long-hid LEUCOTHOE, and doomes  Her father there; DAPHNE the faire  Knowes now no bayes but round her haire;  And to APOLLO and his Sons,  Who pay him their due Orisons,  Bequeaths her lawrell-robe, that flame  Contemnes, Thunder and evill Fame.
    There kneel'd ADONIS fresh as spring,  Gay as his youth, now offering  Herself those joyes with voice and hand,  Which first he could not understand.
    Transfixed VENUS stood amas'd,  Full of the Boy and Love, she gaz'd,  And in imbraces seemed more  Senceless and colde then he before.
  Uselesse Childe!  In vaine (said she)  You beare that fond artillerie;  See heere a pow'r above the slow  Weake execution of thy bow.
    So said, she riv'd the wood in two,  Unedged all his arrowes too,  And with the string their feathers bound  To that part, whence we have our wound.
    See, see! the darts by which we burn'd  Are bright Loysa's pencills turn'd,  With which she now enliveth more  Beauties, than they destroy'd before.

1>      Were it that you so shun me, 'cause you wish  (Cruels't) a fellow in your wretchednesse,  Or that you take some small ease in your owne  Torments, to heare another sadly groane,  I were most happy in my paines, to be  So truely blest, to be so curst by thee:  But oh! my cries to that doe rather adde,  Of which too much already thou hast had,  And thou art gladly sad to heare my moane;  Yet sadly hearst me with derision.
      Thou most unjust, that really dust know,  And feelst thyselfe the flames I burne in.
  Oh!  How can you beg to be set loose from that  Consuming stake you binde another at?      Uncharitablest both wayes, to denie  That pity me, for which yourself must dye,  To love not her loves you, yet know the pain  What 'tis to love, and not be lov'd againe.
      Flye on, flye on, swift Racer, untill she  Whom thou of all ador'st shall learne of thee  The pace t'outfly thee, and shall teach thee groan,  What terrour 'tis t'outgo and be outgon.
      Nor yet looke back, nor yet must we  Run then like spoakes in wheeles eternally,  And never overtake?  Be dragg'd on still  By the weake cordage of your untwin'd will  Round without hope of rest?  No, I will turne,  And with my goodnes boldly meete your scorne;  My goodnesse which Heav'n pardon, and that fate  MADE YOU HATE LOVE, AND FALL IN LOVE WITH HATE.
      But I am chang'd!  Bright reason, that did give  My soule a noble quicknes, made me live  One breath yet longer, and to will, and see  Hath reacht me pow'r to scorne as well as thee:  That thou, which proudly tramplest on my grave,  Thyselfe mightst fall, conquer'd my double slave:  That thou mightst, sinking in thy triumphs, moan,  And I triumph in my destruction.

  This poem is extracted in CENSURA LITERARIA, ix.
 352,  as a favourable specimen of Lovelace's poetical genius.
  The  text is manifestly corrupt, but I have endeavoured to amend it.
  In Elton's SPECIMENS OF CLASSIC POETS, 1814, i.
 148, is a  translation of Anacreon's Address to the Cicada, or Tree-Locust  (Lovelace's grasshopper?), which is superior to the modern poem,  being less prolix, and more natural in its manner.
  In all  Lovelace's longer pieces there are too many obscure and feeble  conceits, and too many evidences of a leaning to the metaphysical  and antithetical school of poetry.

 CASSANDRA COTTON,       ONLY SISTER TO MR.
 C.
 COTTON.
<42.
1>      Hither with hallowed steps as is the ground,  That must enshrine this saint with lookes profound,  And sad aspects as the dark vails you weare,  Virgins opprest, draw gently, gently neare;  Enter the dismall chancell of this rooome,  Where each pale guest stands fixt a living tombe;  With trembling hands helpe to remove this earth  To its last death and first victorious birth:  Let gums and incense fume, who are at strife  To enter th' hearse and breath in it new life;  Mingle your steppes with flowers as you goe,  Which, as they haste to fade, will speake your woe.
      And when y' have plac't your tapers on her urn,  How poor a tribute 'tis to weep and mourn!  That flood the channell of your eye-lids fils,  When you lose trifles, or what's lesse, your wills.
  If you'l be worthy of these obsequies,  Be blind unto the world, and drop your eyes;  Waste and consume, burn downward as this fire  That's fed no more: so willingly expire;  Passe through the cold and obscure narrow way,  Then light your torches at the spring of day,  There with her triumph in your victory.
  Such joy alone and such solemnity  Becomes this funerall of virginity.
      Or, if you faint to be so blest, oh heare!  If not to dye, dare but to live like her:  Dare to live virgins, till the honour'd age  Of thrice fifteen cals matrons on the stage,  Whilst not a blemish or least staine is scene  On your white roabe 'twixt fifty and fifteene;  But as it in your swathing-bands was given,  Bring't in your winding sheet unsoyl'd to Heav'n.
  Daere to do purely, without compact good,  Or herald, by no one understood  But him, who now in thanks bows either knee  For th' early benefit and secresie.
      Dare to affect a serious holy sorrow,  To which delights of pallaces are narrow,  And, lasting as their smiles, dig you a roome,  Where practise the probation of your tombe  With ever-bended knees and piercing pray'r,  Smooth the rough passe through craggy earth to ay'r;  Flame there as lights that shipwrackt mariners  May put in safely, and secure their feares,  Who, adding to your joyes, now owe you theirs.
      Virgins, if thus you dare but courage take  To follow her in life, else through this lake  Of Nature wade, and breake her earthly bars,  Y' are fixt with her upon a throne of stars,  Arched with a pure Heav'n chrystaline,  Where round you love and joy for ever shine.
      But you are dumbe, as what you do lament  More senseles then her very monument,  Which at your weaknes weeps.
  Spare that vaine teare,  Enough to burst the rev'rend sepulcher.
  Rise and walk home; there groaning prostrate fall,  And celebrate your owne sad funerall:  For howsoe're you move, may heare, or see,  YOU ARE MORE DEAD AND BURIED THEN SHEE.

      You that shall live awhile, before  Old time tyrs, and is no more:  When that this ambitious stone  Stoopes low as what it tramples on:  Know that in that age, when sinne  Gave the world law, and governd Queene,  A virgin liv'd, that still put on  White thoughts, though out of fashion:  That trac't the stars, 'spite of report,  And durst be good, though chidden for't:  Of such a soule that infant Heav'n  Repented what it thus had giv'n:  For finding equall happy man,  Th' impatient pow'rs snatch it agen.
  Thus, chaste as th' ayre whither shee's fled,  She, making her celestiall bed  In her warme alablaster, lay  As cold is in this house of clay:  Nor were the rooms unfit to feast  Or circumscribe this angel-guest;  The radiant gemme was brightly set  In as divine a carkanet;  Of<44.
2> which the clearer was not knowne,  Her minde or her complexion.
  Such an everlasting grace,  Such a beatifick face,  Incloysters here this narrow floore,  That possest all hearts before.
      Blest and bewayl'd in death and birth!  The smiles and teares of heav'n and earth!  Virgins at each step are afeard,  Filmer is shot by which they steer'd,  Their star extinct, their beauty dead,  That the yong world to honour led;  But see! the rapid spheres stand still,  And tune themselves unto her will.
      Thus, although this marble must,  As all things, crumble into dust,  And though you finde this faire-built tombe  Ashes, as what lyes in its wombe:  Yet her saint-like name shall shine  A living glory to this shrine,  And her eternall fame be read,  When all but VERY VERTUE'S DEAD.

      See! what a clouded majesty, and eyes  Whose glory through their mist doth brighter rise!    See! what an humble bravery doth shine,  And griefe triumphant breaking through each line,  How it commands the face! so sweet a scorne  Never did HAPPY MISERY adorne!  So sacred a contempt, that others show  To this, (oth' height of all the wheele) below,  That mightiest monarchs by this shaded booke  May coppy out their proudest, richest looke.
      Whilst the true eaglet this quick luster spies,  And by his SUN'S enlightens his owne eyes;  He cures<45.
2> his cares, his burthen feeles, then streight  Joyes that so lightly he can beare such weight;  Whilst either eithers passion doth borrow,  And both doe grieve the same victorious sorrow.
      These, my best LILLY, with so bold a spirit  And soft a grace, as if thou didst inherit  For that time all their greatnesse, and didst draw  With those brave eyes your royal sitters saw.
      Not as of old, when a rough hand did speake  A strong aspect, and a faire face, a weake;  When only a black beard cried villaine, and  By hieroglyphicks we could understand;  When chrystall typified in a white spot,  And the bright ruby was but one red blot;  Thou dost the things Orientally the same  Not only paintst its colour, but its flame:  Thou sorrow canst designe without a teare,  And with the man his very hope or feare;  So that th' amazed world shall henceforth finde  None but my LILLY ever drew a MINDE.

  It was drawn at Hampton Court, when  the King was last there, by Mr. Lely, who was earnestly recommended  to him.
  I should have taken it for the hand of Fuller or Dobson.
  It is certainly very unlike Sir Peter's latter manner, and is  stronger than his former.
  The King has none of the melancholy  grace which Vandyck alone, of all his painters, always gave him.
  It has a sterner countenance, and expressive of the tempests he  had experienced.

      With that delight the Royal captiv's<46.

  He weepes at this faire chance, nor wil allow,  But that the diadem doth brand his brow,  And under-rates himselfe below mankinde,  Who first had lost his body, now his minde,      With such a joy came I to heare my dombe,  And haste the preparation of my tombe,  When, like good angels who have heav'nly charge  To steere and guide mans sudden giddy barge,  She snatcht me from the rock I was upon,  And landed me at life's pavillion:  Where I, thus wound out of th' immense abysse,  Was straight set on a pinacle of blisse.
      Let me leape in againe! and by that fall  Bring me to my first woe, so cancel all:  Ah! 's this a quitting of the debt you owe,  To crush her and her goodnesse at one blowe?    Defend me from so foule impiety,  Would make friends grieve, and furies weep to see.
      Now, ye sage spirits, which infuse in men  That are oblidg'd twice to oblige agen,  Informe my tongue in labour what to say,  And in what coyne or language to repay.
  But you are silent as the ev'nings ayre,  When windes unto their hollow grots repaire.
<46.

When she walks forth, ye perfum'd wings oth' East,  Fan her, 'til with the Sun she hastes to th' West,  And when her heav'nly course calles up the day,  And breakes as bright, descend, some glistering ray,  To circle her, and her as glistering haire,  That all may say a living saint shines there.
  Slow Time, with woollen feet make thy soft pace,  And leave no tracks ith' snow of her pure face;  But when this vertue must needs fall, to rise  The brightest constellation in the skies;  When we in characters of fire shall reade,  How cleere she was alive, how spotless, dead.
  All you that are a kinne to piety:  For onely you can her close mourners be,  Draw neer, and make of hallowed teares a dearth:  Goodnes and justice both are fled the earth.
      If this be to be thankful, I'v a heart  Broaken with vowes, eaten with grateful smart,  And beside this, the vild<46.
4> world nothing hath  Worth anything but her provoked wrath;  So then, who thinkes to satisfie in time,  Must give a satisfaction for that crime:  Since she alone knowes the gifts value, she  Can onely to her selfe requitall be,  And worthyly to th' life paynt her owne story  In its true colours and full native glory;  Which when perhaps she shal be heard to tell,  Buffoones and theeves, ceasing to do ill,  Shal blush into a virgin-innocence,  And then woo others from the same offence;  The robber and the murderer, in 'spite  Of his red spots, shal startle into white:  All good (rewards layd by) shal stil increase  For love of her, and villany decease;<46.
5>  Naught<46.

      So that, when as my future daring bayes  Shall bow it selfe<46.
7> in lawrels to her praise,  To crown her conqu'ring goodnes, and proclaime  The due renowne and glories of her name:  My wit shal be so wretched and so poore  That, 'stead of praysing, I shal scandal her,  And leave, when with my purest art I'v done,  Scarce the designe of what she is begunne:  Yet men shal send me home, admir'd, exact;  Proud, that I could from her so wel detract.
      Where, then, thou bold instinct, shal I begin  My endlesse taske?  To thanke her were a sin  Great as not speake, and not to speake, a blame  Beyond what's worst, such as doth want a name;  So thou my all, poore gratitude, ev'n thou  In this wilt an unthankful office do:  Or wilt I fling all at her feet I have:  My life, my love, my very soule, a slave?  Tye my free spirit onely unto her,  And yeeld up my affection prisoner?  Fond thought, in this thou teachest me to give  What first was hers, since by her breath I live;  And hast but show'd me, how I may resigne  Possession of those thing are none of mine.

  Now, proud usurpers on the right    Of sacred beauty, heare your dombe;  Recant your sex, your mastry, might;    Lower you cannot be or'ecome:                        VI.

                 A PROLOGUE TO THE SCHOLARS.
   A COMAEDY PRESENTED AT THE WHITE FRYERS.
<47.
1>      A gentleman, to give us somewhat new,  Hath brought up OXFORD with him to show you;  Pray be not frighted--Tho the scaene and gown's  The Universities, the wit's the town's;  The lines each honest Englishman may speake:  Yet not mistake his mother-tongue for Greeke,  For stil 'twas part of his vow'd liturgie:--  From learned comedies deliver me!  Wishing all those that lov'd 'em here asleepe,  Promising SCHOLARS, but no SCHOLARSHIP.
      You'd smile to see, how he do's vex and shake,  Speakes naught; but, if the PROLOGUE do's but take,  Or the first act were past the pikes once, then--  Then hopes and joys, then frowns and fears agen,  Then blushes like a virgin, now to be  Rob'd of his comicall virginity  In presence of you all.
  In short, you'd say  More hopes of mirth are in his looks then play.
      These feares are for the noble and the wise;  But if 'mongst you there are such fowle dead eyes,  As can damne unaraign'd, cal law their pow'rs,  Judging it sin enough that it is ours,  And with the house shift their decreed desires,  FAIRE still to th' BLACKE, BLACKE still to the WHITE-FRYERS;<47.

  From the terms of the epilogue it seems to have  been a piece occupying two hours in the performance.
  Judging,  I presume, from the opening lines, Mr. Halliwell supposes it  to have been originally acted at Gloucester Hall.
  Probably  Mr. Halliwell is right.

      Th' other for the gentlemen oth' pit,  Like to themselves, all spirit, fancy, wit,  In which plots should be subtile as a flame,  Disguises would make PROTEUS stil the same:  Humours so rarely humour'd and exprest,  That ev'n they should thinke 'em so, not drest;  Vices acted and applauded too, times  Tickled, and th' actors acted, not their crimes,  So he might equally applause have gain'd  Of th' hardned, sooty, and the snowy hand.

      Wouldst thou with tempests lye?  Then bow  To th' rougher furrows of her brow,  Or make a thunder-bolt thy choyce?  Then catch at her more fatal voyce;  Or 'gender with the lightning? trye  The subtler<49.

  When flowing cups run swiftly round    With no allaying THAMES,  Our carelesse heads with roses bound,    Our hearts with loyal flames;  When thirsty griefe in wine we steepe,    When healths and draughts go free,  Fishes, that tipple in the deepe,    Know no such libertie.
                        III.
  When (like committed linnets<50.
5>) I    With shriller throat shall sing  The sweetnes, mercy, majesty,    And glories of my King.
  When I shall voyce aloud, how good    He is, how great should be,  Inlarged winds, that curle the flood,    Know no such liberty.
                        IV.
  Stone walls doe not a prison make,    Nor iron bars a cage;  Mindes innocent and quiet take    That for an hermitage;  If I have freedome in my love,    And in my soule am free,  Angels alone that sore above    Enjoy such liberty.

1> The first stanza of this famous song is harmonized in  CHEERFULL AYRES OR BALLADS: FIRST COMPOSED FOR ONE SINGLE VOICE,  AND SINCE SET FOR THREE VOICES.

  I have sometimes thought that,  when Lovelace composed this production, he had in his recollection  some of the sentiments in Wither's SHEPHERDS HUNTING, 1615.
  See,  more particularly, the sonnet (at p.
 248 of Mr. Gutch's Bristol  edition) commencing:--        "I that er'st while the world's sweet air did draw.
"    <50.
2> Peele, in KING DAVID AND FAIR BETHSABE, 1599, has a similar  figure, where David says:--        "Now comes my lover tripping like the roe,       And brings my longings tangled in her hair.
"    The "lover" is of course Bethsabe.
    <50.
3> Thus Middleton, in his MORE DISSEMBLERS BESIDES WOMEN,  printed in 1657, but written before 1626, says:--                                 "But for modesty,       I should fall foul in words upon fond man,       That can forget his excellence and honour,       His serious meditations, being the end       Of his creation, to learn well to die;       And live a PRISONER TO A WOMAN'S EYE.
"    <50.
4> Original reads GODS; the present word is substituted  in accordance with a MS.
 copy of the song printed by the late  Dr.
 Bliss, in his edition of Woods ATHENAE.
  If Dr.
 Bliss had  been aware of the extraordinary corruptions under which the text  of LUCASTA laboured, he would have had less hesitation in adopting  BIRDS as the true reading.
  The "Song to Althea," is a favourable  specimen of the class of composition to which it belongs; but  I fear that it has been over-estimated.
    <50.
5> Percy very unnecessarily altered LIKE COMMITTED LINNETS  to LINNET-LIKE CONFINED (Percy's RELIQUES, ii.
 247; Moxon's ed.
)  Ellis (SPECIMENS OF EARLY ENGLISH POETS, ed.
 1801, iii.
 252)  says that this latter reading is "more intelligible.
" It is not,  however, either what Lovelace wrote, or what (it may be presumed)  he intended to write, and nothing, it would seem, can be clearer  than the passage as it stands, COMMITTED signifying, in fact,  nothing more than CONFINED.
  It is fortunate for the lovers  of early English literature that Bp.
 Percy had comparatively  little to do with it.
  Emendation of a text is well enough;  but the wholesale and arbitrary slaughter of it is quite another  matter.

  Whitelocke speaks very highly of his  military character.
  In a poem called THE GALLANTS OF THE TIMES,  printed in "Wit Restored," 1658, there is the following passage:--        "A great burgandine for WILL MURRAY'S sake       GEORGE SYMONDS, he vows the first course to take:       When STRADLING a Graecian dog let fly,       Who took the bear by the nose immediately;       To see them so forward Hugh Pollard did smile,       Who had an old curr of Canary oyl,       And held up his head that GEORGE GORING might see,       Who then cryed aloud, TO MEE, BOYS, TO MEE!"    See, also, THE ANSWER:--        "GEORGE, Generall of Guenefrieds,       He is a joviall lad,     Though his heart and fortunes disagree       Oft times to make him sad.

2> A LA CHABOT was a French dance tune, christened after  the admiral of that name, in the same manner as A LA BOURBON,  mentioned elsewhere in LUCASTA, derived its title from another  celebrated person.
  Those who have any acquaintance with the  history of early English music need not to be informed that  it was formerly the practice of our own composers to seek the  patronage of the gentlemen and ladies about the Court for their  works, and to identify their names with them.

  Thus have I heard to childrens cries  The faire nurse still such lullabies,  That, well all sayd (for what there lay),  The pleasure did the sorrow pay.
      Sure ther's another way to save  Your phansie,<53.

8> to it chaunts or scrapes.
  The merry Phaeton oth' carre  You'l vow makes a melodious jarre;  Sweeter and sweeter whisleth He  To un-anointed<53.
9> axel-tree;  Such swift notes he and 's wheels do run;  For me, I yeeld him Phaebus son.
    Say, faire Comandres, can it be  You should ordaine a mutinie?  For where I howle, all accents fall,  As kings harangues, to one and all.

11>  You ravish both with sweet and good;  Saint Syren, sing, for I dare heare,  But when I ope', oh, stop your eare.
      Far lesse be't aemulation  To passe me, or in trill or<53.

<53.
14>      Yet can I musick too; but such  As is beyond all voice or<53.
15> touch;  My minde can in faire order chime,  Whilst my true heart still beats the time;  My soule['s] so full of harmonie,  That it with all parts can agree;  If you winde up to the highest fret,<53.
16>  It shall descend an eight from it,  And when you shall vouchsafe to fall,  Sixteene above you it shall call,  And yet, so dis-assenting one,  They both shall meet in<53.
17> unison.
      Come then, bright cherubin, begin!  My loudest musick is within.
  Take all notes with your skillfull eyes;  Hearke, if mine do not sympathise!  Sound all my thoughts, and see exprest  The tablature<53.
18> of my large brest;  Then you'l admit, that I too can  Musick above dead sounds of man;  Such as alone doth blesse the spheres,  Not to be reacht with humane eares.

 copy.
  "The Lady A.
 L.
" and  "Madam A.
 L.
" may very probably be two different persons: for  Carew in his Poems (edit.
 1651, 8vo.
 p.
 2) has a piece "To A.
 L.
;  Persuasions to Love," and it is possible that the A.
 L.
 of Carew,  and the A.
 L.
 mentioned above, are identical.
  The following poem  is printed in Durfey's PILLS TO PURGE MELANCHOLY, v.
 120, but  whether it was written by Lovelace, and addressed to the same lady,  whom he represents above as requesting him to join her in a song,  or whether it was the production of another pen, I cannot at all  decide.
  It is not particularly unlike the style of the author of  LUCASTA.
  At all events, I am not aware that it has been  appropriated by anybody else, and as I am reluctant to omit any  piece which Lovelace is at all likely to have composed, I give  these lines just as I find them in Durfey, where they are set to  music:--          "TO HIS FAIREST VALENTINE MRS.
 A.
 L.
        "Come, pretty birds, present your lays,       And learn to chaunt a goddess praise;       Ye wood-nymphs, let your voices be       Employ'd to serve her deity:       And warble forth, ye virgins nine,       Some music to my Valentine.
        "Her bosom is love's paradise,       There is no heav'n but in her eyes;       She's chaster than the turtle-dove,       And fairer than the queen of love:       Yet all perfections do combine       To beautifie my Valentine.
        "She's Nature's choicest cabinet,       Where honour, beauty, worth and wit       Are all united in her breast.
       The graces claim an interest:       All virtues that are most divine       Shine clearest in my Valentine.

8> This must refer, I suppose, to the ballad of Queen Dido,  which the woman sings as she works.
  The signification of LOVE-BANG  is not easily determined.
  BANG, in Suffolk, is a term applied  to a particular kind of cheese; but I suspect that "love-bang Kate"  merely signifies "noisy Kate" here.
  As to the old ballad of Dido,  see Stafford Smith's MUSICA ANTIQUA, i.
 10, ii.
 158; and Collier's  EXTRACTS FROM THE REGISTERS OF THE STATIONERS' COMPANY, i.
 98.
  I subjoin the first stanza of "Dido" as printed in the MUSICA  ANTIQUA:--        "Dido was the Carthage Queene,       And lov'd the Troian knight,       That wandring many coasts had seene,       And many a dreadfull fight.
       As they a-hunting road, a show'r       Drove them in a loving bower,       Down to a darksome cave:       Where Aenaeas with his charmes       Lock't Queene Dido in his armes       And had what he would have.

                        I.
  Now fie upon that everlasting life!  I dye!    She hates!  Ah me!  It makes me mad;  As if love fir'd his torch at a moist eye,    Or with his joyes e're crown'd the sad.
  Oh, let me live and shout, when I fall on;    Let me ev'n triumph in the first attempt!    Loves duellist from conquest 's not exempt,  When his fair murdresse shall not gain one groan,  And he expire ev'n in ovation.

  Let her make sallies hourely: yet I'le find  (Though all beat of) shee's to be undermin'd.

  Then may it please your little excellence    Of hearts t' ordaine, by sound of lips,  That henceforth none in tears dare love comence    (Her thoughts ith' full, his, in th' eclipse);  On paine of having 's launce broke on her bed,    That he be branded all free beauties' slave,    And his own hollow eyes be domb'd his grave:  Since in your hoast that coward nere was fed,  Who to his prostrate ere was prostrated.

  "Also, at Mr. Rose's, a jeweller in Henrietta Street, in Covent  Garden, is an excellent piece of hers, drawne after she was newly  dead.
  She had a most lovely sweet-turned face, delicate darke  browne haire.

4> A RASCAL DEER was formerly a well-known term among  sportsmen, signifying a lean beast, not worth pursuit.
  Thus  in A C.
 MERY TALYS (1525), No.
 29, we find:--"[they] apoynted  thys Welchman to stand still, and forbade him in any wyse  to shote at no rascal dere, but to make sure of the greate male,  and spare not.
" In the new edition of Nares, other and more recent  examples of the employment of the term are given.
  But in the  BOOK OF SAINT ALBANS, 1486, RASCAL is used in the signification  merely of a beast other than one of "enchace.
"        "And where that ye come in playne or in place,       I shall you tell whyche ben bestys of enchace.
       One of them is the bucke: a nother is the doo:       The foxe and the marteron: and the wylde roo.

2> In his poem entitled "Mediocrity in Love rejected,"  Carew has a similar sentiment:--        "Give me more Love, or more Disdain,       The Torrid, or the Frozen Zone,       Bring equall ease unto my paine;       The Temperate affords me none:       Either extreme, of Love, or Hate,       Is sweeter than a calme estate.

    And so also Stanley (AYRES AND DIALOGUES, set by J.

    Cord.
     Distressed pilgrim, whose dark clouded eyes            Speak thee a martyr to love's cruelties,            Whither away?  Amor.
                      What pitying voice I hear,            Calls back my flying steps?  Cord.
                           Pr'ythee, draw near.
  Amor.
     I shall but say, kind swain, what doth become            Of a lost heart, ere to Elysium            It wounded walks?  Cord.
                      First, it does freely flye            Into the pleasures of a lover's eye;            But, once condemn'd to scorn, it fetter'd lies,            An ever-bowing slave to tyrannies.
  Amor.
     I pity its sad fate, since its offence            Was but for love.
  Can<59.
1> tears recall it thence?  Cord.
     O no, such tears, as do for pity call,            She proudly scorns, and glories at their fall.
  Amor.
     Since neither sighs nor tears, kind shepherd, tell,            Will not a kiss prevail?  Cord.
                           Thou may'st as well            Court Eccho with a kiss.
  Amor.
                           Can no art move            A sacred violence to make her love?  Cord.
     O no! 'tis only Destiny or<59.
2> Fate            Fashions our wills either to love or hate.

As when on blazing wings a blest man sores,  And having past to God through fiery dores,  Straight 's roab'd with flames, when the same element,  Which was his shame, proves now his ornament;  Oh, how he hast'ned death, burn't to be fryed,<60.

  So swift hath been thy race, so full of flight,  Like him condemn'd, ev'n aged with a night,  Cutting all lets with clouds, as if th' hadst been  Like angels plum'd, and borne a Cherubin.
      Or, in your journey towards heav'n, say,  Tooke you the world a little in your way?  Saw'st and dislik'st its vaine pompe, then didst flye  Up for eternall glories to the skye?  Like a religious ambitious one,  Aspiredst for the everlasting crowne?      Ah! holy traytour to your brother prince,  Rob'd of his birth-right and preheminence!  Could you ascend yon' chaire of state e're him,  And snatch from th' heire the starry diadem?  Making your honours now as much uneven,  As gods on earth are lesse then saints in heav'n.
      Triumph! sing triumphs, then!  Oh, put on all  Your richest lookes, drest for this festivall!  Thoughts full of ravisht reverence, with eyes  So fixt, as when a saint we canonize;  Clap wings with Seraphins before the throne  At this eternall coronation,  And teach your soules new mirth, such as may be  Worthy this birth-day to divinity.
      But ah! these blast your feasts, the jubilies  We send you up are sad, as were our cries,  And of true joy we can expresse no more  Thus crown'd, then when we buried thee before.
      Princesse in heav'n, forgivenes! whilst we  Resigne our office to the HIERARCHY.

  1639 is, I believe, a slip of the pen for 1637; that is to say,  the princess was born on the 29th of January, 1637-8.
  This  discrepancy between the CHARISTERIA and the memorandum in Harl.
 MS.
  escaped Sir H.
 Ellis, who was possibly unaware of the existence of  the former.
  For, unless a mistake is assumed on the part of the  writer of the MS.
, the existence of TWO Princesses Katherine must  be granted.

  SHEW, as printed in CHARISTERIA,  is clearly the true word.

 freed.
   FREE and FREED were sometimes formerly  pronounced like FRY and FRYED: for Lord North, in his  FOREST OF VARIETIES, 1645, has these lines--        "Birds that long have lived free,       Caught and cag'd, but pine and die.
"    Here evidently FREE is intended to rhyme with DIE.

  The translation of this celebrated work,  to which Lovelace contributed the commendatory verses here  republished, was executed by his friend Anthony Hodges, A.

  There had been already a translation by W.
 Burton, purporting  to be done from the Greek, in 1597, 4to.

2> There can be no doubt that Sidney's ARCADIA was formerly  as popular in its way among the readers of both sexes as Sir  Richard Baker's CHRONICLE appears to have been.
  The former was  especially recommended to those who sought occasional relaxation  from severer studies.
  See Higford's INSTITUTIONS, 1658, 8vo,  p.
 46-7.
  In his poem of THE SURPRIZE, Cotton describes his  nymph as reading the ARCADIA on the bank of a river--         "The happy OBJECT of her eye       Was SIDNEY'S living ARCADY:       Whose amorous tale had so betrai'd       Desire in this all-lovely maid;       That, whilst her check a blush did warm,       I read LOVES story in her form.

      Faire star, ascend! the joy! the life! the light  Of this tempestuous age, this darke worlds sight!  Oh, from thy crowne of glory dart one flame  May strike a sacred reverence, whilest thy name  (Like holy flamens to their god of day)  We bowing, sing; and whilst we praise, we pray.
      Bright spirit! whose aeternal motion  Of wit, like Time, stil in it selfe did run,  Binding all others in it, and did give  Commission, how far this or that shal live;  Like DESTINY of poems who, as she  Signes death to all, her selfe cam never dye.
      And now thy purple-robed Traegedy,<63.
2>  In her imbroider'd buskins, cals mine eye,  Where the brave Aetius we see betray'd,  T' obey his death, whom thousand lives obey'd;  Whilst that the mighty foole his scepter breakes,  And through his gen'rals wounds his own doome speakes,  Weaving thus richly VALENTINIAN,  The costliest monarch with the cheapest man.
      Souldiers may here to their old glories adde,  The LOVER love, and be with reason MAD:<63.

4>  Who wilder then his bull did teare the house  (Hurling his language with the canvas stone):  Twas thought the monster ror'd the sob'rer tone.
      But ah! when thou thy sorrow didst inspire  With passions, blacke as is her darke attire,  Virgins as sufferers have wept to see  So white a soule, so red a crueltie;  That thou hast griev'd, and with unthought redresse  Dri'd their wet eyes who now thy mercy blesse;  Yet, loth to lose thy watry jewell, when  Joy wip't it off, laughter straight sprung't agen.
      Now ruddy checked Mirth with rosie wings<63.
5>  Fans ev'ry brow with gladnesse, whilst she sings  Delight to all, and the whole theatre  A festivall in heaven doth appeare:  Nothing but pleasure, love; and (like the morne)  Each face a gen'ral smiling doth adorne.
      Heare ye, foul speakers, that pronounce the aire  Of stewes and shores,<63.

            TO THE RIGHT H0N0RABLE JOHN LOVELACE, ESQUIRE.
<64.
1>    SIR,    LUCASTA (fair, but hapless maid!)  Once flourisht underneath the shade  Of your illustrious Mother; now,  An orphan grown, she bows to you!  To you, her vertues' noble heir;  Oh may she find protection there!  Nor let her welcome be the less,  'Cause a rough hand makes her address:  One (to whom foes the Muses are)  Born and bred up in rugged war:  For, conscious how unfit I am,  I only have pronounc'd her name  To waken pity in your brest,  And leave her tears to plead the rest.
            Sir,                 Your most obedient                      Servant and kinsman                   DUDLEY POSTHUMUS-LOVELACE.
      <64.
1> This gentleman was the eldest son of John, second Lord  Lovelace of Hurley, co.
 Berks, by Anne, daughter of Thomas,  Earl of Cleveland.
  The first part of LUCASTA was inscribed  by the poet himself to Lady Lovelace, his mother.
                                     POEMS.
                  TO LVCASTA.
           HER RESERVED LOOKS.
    LUCASTA, frown, and let me die,    But smile, and see, I live;  The sad indifference of your eye    Both kills and doth reprieve.
  You hide our fate within its screen;    We feel our judgment, ere we hear.
  So in one picture I have seen    An angel here, the devil there.
                 LUCASTA LAUGHING.
    Heark, how she laughs aloud,  Although the world put on its shrowd:  Wept at by the fantastic crowd,    Who cry: one drop, let fall  From her, might save the universal ball.
            She laughs again      At our ridiculous pain;    And at our merry misery      She laughs, until she cry.
            Sages, forbear      That ill-contrived tear,            Although your fear  Doth barricado hope from your soft ear.
  That which still makes her mirth to flow,    Is our sinister-handed woe,  Which downwards on its head doth go,    And, ere that it is sown, doth grow.
      This makes her spleen contract,        And her just pleasure feast:      For the unjustest act        Is still the pleasant'st jest.
                           NIGHT.
                    TO LUCASTA.
    Night! loathed jaylor of the lock'd up sun,    And tyrant-turnkey on committed day,  Bright eyes lye fettered in thy dungeon,    And Heaven it self doth thy dark wards obey.
      Thou dost arise our living hell;      With thee grones, terrors, furies dwell;        Until LUCASTA doth awake,  And with her beams these heavy chaines off shake.
    Behold! with opening her almighty lid,  Bright eyes break rowling, and with lustre spread,    And captive day his chariot mounted is;      Night to her proper hell is beat,      And screwed to her ebon seat;  Till th' Earth with play oppressed lies,  And drawes again the curtains of her eyes.
    But, bondslave, I know neither day nor night;    Whether she murth'ring sleep, or saving wake;  Now broyl'd ith' zone of her reflected light,    Then frose, my isicles, not sinews shake.
      Smile then, new Nature, your soft blast      Doth melt our ice, and fires waste;  Whil'st the scorch'd shiv'ring world new born  Now feels it all the day one rising morn.
                  LOVE INTHRON'D.
                   ODE.
                    I.
  Introth, I do my self perswade,    That the wilde boy is grown a man,  And all his childishnesse off laid,    E're since LUCASTA did his fires fan;      H' has left his apish jigs,      And whipping hearts like gigs:    For t' other day I heard him swear,  That beauty should be crown'd in honours chair.
                    II.
  With what a true and heavenly state    He doth his glorious darts dispence,  Now cleans'd from falsehood, blood and hate,    And newly tipt with innocence!      Love Justice is become,      And doth the cruel doome;    Reversed is the old decree;  Behold! he sits inthron'd with majestie.
                   III.
  Inthroned in LUCASTA'S eye,    He doth our faith and hearts survey;  Then measures them by sympathy,    And each to th' others breast convey;      Whilst to his altars now      The frozen vestals bow,    And strickt Diana too doth go  A-hunting with his fear'd, exchanged bow.
                    IV.
  Th' imbracing seas and ambient air    Now in his holy fires burn;  Fish couple, birds and beasts in pair    Do their own sacrifices turn.
      This is a miracle,      That might religion swell;    But she, that these and their god awes,  Her crowned self submits to her own laws.
                        HER MUFFE.
                       I.
  Twas not for some calm blessing to deceive,  Thou didst thy polish'd hands in shagg'd furs weave;    It were no blessing thus obtain'd;    Thou rather would'st a curse have gain'd,  Then let thy warm driven snow be ever stain'd.
                       II.
  Not that you feared the discolo'ring cold  Might alchymize their silver into gold;    Nor could your ten white nuns so sin,    That you should thus pennance them in,  Each in her coarse hair smock of discipline.
                       III.
  Nor, Hero-like who, on their crest still wore  A lyon, panther, leopard, or a bore,    To looke their enemies in their herse,    Thou would'st thy hand should deeper pierce,  And, in its softness rough, appear more fierce.
                       IV.
  No, no, LUCASTA, destiny decreed,  That beasts to thee a sacrifice should bleed,    And strip themselves to make you gay:    For ne'r yet herald did display  A coat, where SABLES upon ERMIN lay.
                       V.
  This for lay-lovers, that must stand at dore,  Salute the threshold, and admire no more;    But I, in my invention tough,    Rate not this outward bliss enough,  But still contemplate must the hidden muffe.
          A BLACK PATCH<65.
1> ON LUCASTA'S FACE.
    Dull as I was, to think that a court fly              Presum'd so neer her eye;              When 'twas th' industrious bee          Mistook her glorious face for paradise,  To summe up all his chymistry of spice;    With a brave pride and honour led,    Neer both her suns he makes his bed,  And, though a spark, struggles to rise as red.
              Then aemulates the gay                Daughter of day;        Acts the romantick phoenix' fate,    When now, with all his sweets lay'd out in state,      LUCASTA scatters but one heat,  And all the aromatick pills do sweat,  And gums calcin'd themselves to powder beat,            Which a fresh gale of air            Conveys into her hair;            Then chaft, he's set on fire,  And in these holy flames doth glad expire;        And that black marble tablet there          So neer her either sphere        Was plac'd; nor foyl, nor ornament,  But the sweet little bee's large monument.
    <65.
1> The following is a poet's lecture to the ladies of his  time on the long prevailing practice of wearing patches,  in which it seems that Lucasta acquiesced:--                    BLACK PATCHES.
                VANITAS VANITATUM.
       LADIES turn conjurers, and can impart       The hidden mystery of the black art,       Black artificial patches do betray;       They more affect the works of night than day.
       The creature strives the Creator to disgrace,       By patching that which is a perfect face:       A little stain upon the purest dye       Is both offensive to the heart and eye.
       Defile not then with spots that face of snow,       Where the wise God His workmanship doth show,       The light of nature and the light of grace       Is the complexion for a lady's face.

    In a poem entitled THE BURSSE OF REFORMATION, in praise of  the New Exchange, printed in WIT RESTORED, 1658, patches are  enumerated among the wares of all sorts to be procured there:--         "Heer patches are of every cut,        For pimples and for scars.
"    They were also used for rheum, as appears from a passage in  WESTWARD HOE, 1607:--       "JUDITH.
  I am so troubled with the rheum too.
  Mouse, what's               good for it?      HONEY.
   How often I have told you you must get a patch.

                         I.
  As I beheld a winter's evening air,  Curl'd in her court-false-locks of living hair,  Butter'd with jessamine the sun left there.
                         II.
  Galliard and clinquant she appear'd to give,  A serenade or ball to us that grieve,  And teach us A LA MODE more gently live.
                        III.
  But as a Moor, who to her cheeks prefers  White spots, t' allure her black idolaters,  Me thought she look'd all ore-bepatch'd with stars.
                         IV.
  Like the dark front of some Ethiopian queen,  Vailed all ore with gems of red, blew, green,  Whose ugly night seem'd masked with days skreen.
                         V.
  Whilst the fond people offer'd sacrifice  To saphyrs, 'stead of veins and arteries,  And bow'd unto the diamonds, not her eyes.
                         VI.
  Behold LUCASTA'S face, how't glows like noon!  A sun intire is her complexion,  And form'd of one whole constellation.
                        VII.
  So gently shining, so serene, so cleer,  Her look doth universal Nature cheer;  Only a cloud or two hangs here and there.
                         TO LUCASTA.
                          I.
    I laugh and sing, but cannot tell    Whether the folly on't sounds well;                 But then I groan,                 Methinks, in tune;  Whilst grief, despair and fear dance to the air            Of my despised prayer.
                          II.
    A pretty antick love does this,    Then strikes a galliard with a kiss;                 As in the end                 The chords they rend;  So you but with a touch from your fair hand            Turn all to saraband.
                          TO LUCASTA.
                          I.
  Like to the sent'nel stars, I watch all night;       For still the grand round of your light                 And glorious breast            Awake<66.

  Now on my down I'm toss'd as on a wave,       And my repose is made my grave;                 Fluttering I lye,            Do beat my self and dye,  But for a resurrection from your eye.
                         III.
  Ah, my fair murdresse! dost thou cruelly heal       With various pains to make me well?                 Then let me be            Thy cut anatomie,  And in each mangled part my heart you'l see.

                    II.
  Blow then, unruly northwind, blow,  'Till in their holds your eyes you stow;  And swell your cheeks, bequeath chill death;  See! she hath smil'd thee out of breath.
                   III.
  Court, gentle zephyr, court and fan  Her softer breast's carnation wan;  Your charming rhethorick of down  Flyes scatter'd from before her frown.
                    IV.
  Say, my white water-lilly, say,  How is't those warm streams break away,  Cut by thy chast cold breast, which dwells  Amidst them arm'd in isicles?                    V.
  And the hot floods, more raging grown,  In flames of thee then in their own,  In their distempers wildly glow,  And kisse thy pillar of fix'd snow.
                    VI.
  No sulphur, through whose each blew vein  The thick and lazy currents strein,  Can cure the smarting nor the fell  Blisters of love, wherewith they swell.
                   VII.
  These great physicians of the blind,  The lame, and fatal blains of Inde  In every drop themselves now see  Speckled with a new leprosie.
                   VIII.
  As sick drinks are with old wine dash'd,  Foul waters too with spirits wash'd,  Thou greiv'd, perchance, one tear let'st fall,  Which straight did purifie them all.
                    IX.
  And now is cleans'd enough the flood,  Which since runs cleare as doth thy blood;  Of the wet pearls uncrown thy hair,  And mantle thee with ermin air.

  Lucasta, hail! fair conqueresse  Of fire, air, earth and seas!  Thou whom all kneel to, yet even thou  Wilt unto love, thy captive, bow.

  Forbear, thou great good husband, little ant;    A little respite from thy flood of sweat!  Thou, thine own horse and cart under this plant,    Thy spacious tent, fan thy prodigious heat;  Down with thy double load of that one grain!  It is a granarie for all thy train.
                         II.
  Cease, large example of wise thrift, awhile    (For thy example is become our law),  And teach thy frowns a seasonable smile:    So Cato sometimes the nak'd Florals saw.
<67.

  LUCASTA, she that holy makes the day,    And 'stills new life in fields of fueillemort,<67.
3>  Hath back restor'd their verdure with one ray,    And with her eye bid all to play and sport,  Ant, to work still! age will thee truant call;  And to save now, th'art worse than prodigal.
                         IV.
  Austere and cynick! not one hour t' allow,    To lose with pleasure, what thou gotst with pain;  But drive on sacred festivals thy plow,    Tearing high-ways with thy ore-charged wain.
  Not all thy life-time one poor minute live,  And thy ore-labour'd bulk with mirth relieve?                         V.
  Look up then, miserable ant, and spie    Thy fatal foes, for breaking of their<67.
4> law,  Hov'ring above thee: Madam MARGARET PIE:    And her fierce servant, meagre Sir JOHN DAW:  Thy self and storehouse now they do store up,  And thy whole harvest too within their crop.
                         VI.
  Thus we unt[h]rifty thrive within earth's tomb    For some more rav'nous and ambitious jaw:  The grain in th' ant's, the ant<67.
5> in the pie's womb,    The pie in th' hawk's, the hawk<67.

  So scattering to hord 'gainst a long day,  Thinking to save all, we cast all away.

    In the poems of John Cleveland, 1669, is a piece entitled  "Fuscara, or the Bee Errant," which is of a somewhat similar  character, and is by no means a contemptible production, though  spoiled by that LUES ALCHYMISTICA which disfigures so much of the  poetry of Cleveland's time.
  The abilities of Cleveland as a  writer seem to have been underrated by posterity, in proportion  to the undue praise lavished upon him by his contemporaries.

    Strive not, vain lover, to be fine;    Thy silk's the silk-worm's, and not thine:  You lessen to a fly your mistriss' thought,  To think it may be in a cobweb caught.
    What, though her thin transparent lawn    Thy heart in a strong net hath drawn:  Not all the arms the god of fire ere made  Can the soft bulwarks of nak'd love invade.
                         II.
    Be truly fine, then, and yourself dress    In her fair soul's immac'late glass.
  Then by reflection you may have the bliss  Perhaps to see what a true fineness is;    When all your gawderies will fit    Those only that are poor in wit.
  She that a clinquant outside doth adore,  Dotes on a gilded statue and no more.

       How often have my tears       Invaded your soft ears,       And dropp'd their silent chimes       A thousand thousand times?       Whilst echo did your eyes,       And sweetly sympathize;       But that the wary lid       Their sluces did forbid.

       My arms did plead my wound,       Each in the other bound;       Volleys of sighs did crowd,       And ring my griefs alowd;       Grones, like a canon-ball,       Batter'd the marble wall,       That the kind neighb'ring grove       Did mutiny for love.

                      THE FALCON.
      Fair Princesse of the spacious air,  That hast vouchsaf'd acquaintance here,  With us are quarter'd below stairs,  That can reach heav'n with nought but pray'rs;  Who, when our activ'st wings we try,  Advance a foot into the sky.
      Bright heir t' th' bird imperial,  From whose avenging penons fall  Thunder and lightning twisted spun!  Brave cousin-german to the Sun!  That didst forsake thy throne and sphere,  To be an humble pris'ner here;  And for a pirch of her soft hand,  Resign the royal woods' command.
      How often would'st thou shoot heav'ns ark,  Then mount thy self into a lark;  And after our short faint eyes call,  When now a fly, now nought at all!  Then stoop so swift unto our sence,  As thou wert sent intelligence!      Free beauteous slave, thy happy feet  In silver fetters vervails<70.
1> meet,  And trample on that noble wrist,  The gods have kneel'd in vain t' have kist.
  But gaze not, bold deceived spye,  Too much oth' lustre of her eye;  The Sun thou dost out stare, alas!  Winks at the glory of her face.
      Be safe then in thy velvet helm,  Her looks are calms that do orewhelm,  Then the Arabian bird more blest,  Chafe in the spicery of her breast,  And loose you in her breath a wind  Sow'rs the delicious gales of Inde.
      But now a quill from thine own wing  I pluck, thy lofty fate to sing;  Whilst we behold the varions fight  With mingled pleasure and affright;  The humbler hinds do fall to pray'r,  As when an army's seen i' th' air,  And the prophetick spannels run,  And howle thy epicedium.
      The heron mounted doth appear  On his own Peg'sus a lanceer,  And seems, on earth when he doth hut,  A proper halberdier on foot;  Secure i' th' moore, about to sup,  The dogs have beat his quarters up.
      And now he takes the open air,  Drawes up his wings with tactick care;  Whilst th' expert falcon swift doth climbe  In subtle mazes serpentine;  And to advantage closely twin'd  She gets the upper sky and wind,  Where she dissembles to invade,  And lies a pol'tick ambuscade.
      The hedg'd-in heron, whom the foe  Awaits above, and dogs below,  In his fortification lies,  And makes him ready for surprize;  When roused with a shrill alarm,  Was shouted from beneath: they arm.
      The falcon charges at first view  With her brigade of talons, through  Whose shoots, the wary heron beat  With a well counterwheel'd retreat.
  But the bold gen'ral, never lost,  Hath won again her airy post;  Who, wild in this affront, now fryes,  Then gives a volley of her eyes.
      The desp'rate heron now contracts  In one design all former facts;  Noble, he is resolv'd to fall,  His and his en'mies funerall,  And (to be rid of her) to dy,  A publick martyr of the sky.
      When now he turns his last to wreak  The palizadoes of his beak,  The raging foe impatient,  Wrack'd with revenge, and fury rent,  Swift as the thunderbolt he strikes  Too sure upon the stand of pikes;  There she his naked breast doth hit,  And on the case of rapiers's split.
      But ev'n in her expiring pangs  The heron's pounc'd within her phangs,  And so above she stoops to rise,  A trophee and a sacrifice;  Whilst her own bells in the sad fall  Ring out the double funerall.
      Ah, victory, unhap'ly wonne!  Weeping and red is set the Sun;  Whilst the whole field floats in one tear,  And all the air doth mourning wear.
  Close-hooded all thy kindred come  To pay their vows upon thy tombe;  The hobby<70.
2> and the musket<70.
3> too  Do march to take their last adieu.
      The lanner<70.
4> and the lanneret<70.
5>  Thy colours bear as banneret;  The GOSHAWK and her TERCEL<70.
6> rows'd  With tears attend thee as new bows'd,  All these are in their dark array,  Led by the various herald-jay.
      But thy eternal name shall live  Whilst quills from ashes fame reprieve,  Whilst open stands renown's wide dore,  And wings are left on which to soar;  Doctor robbin, the prelate pye,  And the poetick swan, shall dye,  Only to sing thy elegie.

            LOVE MADE IN THE FIRST AGE.
                TO CHLORIS.
                     I.
  In the nativity of time,  Chloris! it was not thought a crime    In direct Hebrew for to woe.
  Now wee make love, as all on fire,  Ring retrograde our lowd desire,    And court in English backward too.
                     II.
  Thrice happy was that golden age,  When complement was constru'd rage,    And fine words in the center hid;  When cursed NO stain'd no maid's blisse,  And all discourse was summ'd in YES,    And nought forbad, but to forbid.
                    III.
<71.
1>  Love then unstinted love did sip,  And cherries pluck'd fresh from the lip,    On cheeks and roses free he fed;  Lasses, like Autumne plums, did drop,  And lads indifferently did drop    A flower and a maiden-head.
                     IV.
  Then unconfined each did tipple  Wine from the bunch, milk from the nipple;    Paps tractable as udders were.
  Then equally the wholsome jellies  Were squeez'd from olive-trees and bellies:    Nor suits of trespasse did they fear.
                     V.
  A fragrant bank of strawberries,  Diaper'd with violets' eyes,    Was table, table-cloth and fare;  No palace to the clouds did swell,  Each humble princesse then did dwell    In the Piazza of her hair.
                     VI.
  Both broken faith and th' cause of it,  All-damning gold, was damn'd to th' pit;    Their troth seal'd with a clasp and kisse,  Lasted until that extreem day,  In which they smil'd their souls away,    And in each other breath'd new blisse.
                    VII.
  Because no fault, there was no tear;  No grone did grate the granting ear,    No false foul breath, their del'cat smell.
  No serpent kiss poyson'd the tast,  Each touch was naturally chast,    And their mere Sense a Miracle.
                    VIII.
  Naked as their own innocence,  And unembroyder'd from offence,    They went, above poor riches, gay;  On softer than the cignet's down,  In beds they tumbled off their own:    For each within the other lay.
                     IX.
  Thus did they live: thus did they love,  Repeating only joyes above,    And angels were but with cloaths on,  Which they would put off cheerfully,  To bathe them in the Galaxie,    Then gird them with the heavenly zone.
                     X.
  Now, Chloris! miserably crave  The offer'd blisse you would not have,    Which evermore I must deny:  Whilst ravish'd with these noble dreams,  And crowned with mine own soft beams,    Injoying of my self I lye.

4>      And why an honour'd ragged shirt, that shows,  Like tatter'd ensigns, all its bodie's blows?  Should it be swathed in a vest so dire,  It were enough to set the child on fire;  Dishevell'd queen[s] should strip them of their hair,  And in it mantle the new rising heir:  Nor do I know ought worth to wrap it in,  Except my parchment upper-coat of skin;  And then expect no end of its chast tears,  That first was rowl'd in down, now furs of bears.

 TO A LADY WITH CHILDE THAT ASK'T AN OLD SHIRT.
  The custom to which the Poet here refers, was no doubt common  in his time; although the indefatigable Brand does not appear  to have met with any illustration of it, except in LUCASTA.
  But since the note at p.
 183 <i.
e.
 note 72.
1> was written, the  following passage in the old morality of THE MARRIAGE OF WIT  AND WISDOM (circa 1570) has come under my notice:--        "INDULGENCE [to her son WIT].
         Well, yet before the goest, hold heare           MY BLESSING IN A CLOUTE,           WELL FARE THE MOTHER AT A NEEDE,           Stand to thy tackling stout.
"    The allusion is to the contemplated marriage of WIT to his  betrothed, WISDOM.
                       SONG.
                     I.
  In mine one monument I lye,    And in my self am buried;  Sure, the quick lightning of her eye    Melted my soul ith' scabberd dead;  And now like some pale ghost I walk,  And with another's spirit talk.
                     II.
  Nor can her beams a heat convey,    That may my frozen bosome warm,  Unless her smiles have pow'r, as they,    That a cross charm can countercharm.
  But this is such a pleasing pain,  I'm loth to be alive again.
                     ANOTHER.
    I did believe I was in heav'n,  When first the heav'n her self was giv'n,  That in my heart her beams did passe  As some the sun keep in a glasse,  So that her beauties thorow me  Did hurt my rival-enemy.
  But fate, alas! decreed it so,  That I was engine to my woe:  For, as a corner'd christal spot,  My heart diaphanous was not;  But solid stuffe, where her eye flings  Quick fire upon the catching strings:  Yet, as at triumphs in the night,  You see the Prince's Arms in light,  So, when I once was set on flame,  I burnt all ore the letters of her name.
                            ODE.
                         I.
  You are deceiv'd; I sooner may, dull fair,  Seat a dark Moor in Cassiopea's<73.
1> chair,      Or on the glow-worm's uselesse light      Bestow the watching flames of night,          Or give the rose's breath          To executed death,              Ere the bright hiew              Of verse to you;  It is just Heaven on beauty stamps a fame,  And we, alas! its triumphs but proclaim.
                         II.
  What chains but are too light for me, should I  Say that Lucasta in strange arms could lie?      Or that Castara<73.
2> were impure;      Or Saccarisa's<73.
3> faith unsure?          That Chloris' love, as hair,          Embrac'd each en'mies air;              That all their good              Ran in their blood?  'Tis the same wrong th' unworthy to inthrone,  As from her proper sphere t' have vertue thrown.
                        III.
  That strange force on the ignoble hath renown;  As AURUM FULMINANS, it blows vice down.
      'Twere better (heavy one) to crawl      Forgot, then raised, trod on [to] fall.
          All your defections now          Are not writ on your brow;              Odes to faults give              A shame must live.
  When a fat mist we view, we coughing run;  But, that once meteor drawn, all cry: undone.

  How bright the fair Paulina<73.
4> did appear,  When hid in jewels she did seem a star!      But who could soberly behold      A wicked owl in cloath of gold,          Or the ridiculous Ape          In sacred Vesta's shape?              So doth agree              Just praise with thee:  For since thy birth gave thee no beauty, know,  No poets pencil must or can do so.

  In old drawings Cassiopeia  is represented as a woman sitting in a chair with a branch in her  hand, and hence the allusion here.
  Dixon, in his CANIDIA, 1683,  part i.
 p.
 35, makes his witches say:--        "We put on Berenice's hair,       And sit in Cassiopeia's chair.
"    Randolph couples it with "Ariadne's Crowne" in the following  passage:--        "Shine forth a constellation, full and bright,       Bless the poor heavens with more majestick light,       Who in requitall shall present you there       ARIADNE'S CROWNE and CASSIOPEIA'S CHAYR.

                         I.
  Love drunk, the other day, knockt at my brest,      But I, alas! was not within.
  My man, my ear, told me he came t' attest,      That without cause h'd boxed him,  And battered the windows of mine eyes,  And took my heart for one of's nunneries.
                         II.
  I wondred at the outrage safe return'd,      And stormed at the base affront;  And by a friend of mine, bold faith, that burn'd,      I called him to a strict accompt.
  He said that, by the law, the challeng'd might  Take the advantage both of arms and fight.
                        III.
  Two darts of equal length and points he sent,      And nobly gave the choyce to me,  Which I not weigh'd, young and indifferent,      Now full of nought but victorie.
  So we both met in one of's mother's groves,  The time, at the first murm'ring of her doves.

                       V.
  Olympus he renownces, then descends,    And makes a friendship with the fiends;    Bids Charon be no more a slave,    He Argos rigg'd with stars shall have,    And triple Cerberus from below  Must leash'd t' himself with him a hunting go.

    Small type of great ones, that do hum  Within this whole world's narrow room,  That with a busie hollow noise  Catch at the people's vainer voice,  And with spread sails play with their breath,  Whose very hails new christen death.
  Poor Fly, caught in an airy net,  Thy wings have fetter'd now thy feet;  Where, like a Lyon in a toyl,  Howere thou keep'st a noble coyl,  And beat'st thy gen'rous breast, that o're  The plains thy fatal buzzes rore,  Till thy all-bellyd foe (round elf<77.

Nor is't enough thy self do's dresse  To thy swoln lord a num'rous messe,  And by degrees thy thin veins bleed,  And piecemeal dost his poyson feed;  But now devour'd, art like to be  A net spun for thy familie,  And, straight expanded in the air,  Hang'st for thy issue too a snare.
  Strange witty death and cruel ill  That, killing thee, thou thine dost kill!  Like pies, in whose entombed ark  All fowl crowd downward to a lark,  Thou art thine en'mies' sepulcher,  And in thee buriest, too, thine heir.
      Yet Fates a glory have reserv'd  For one so highly hath deserv'd.
  As the rhinoceros doth dy  Under his castle-enemy,  As through the cranes trunk throat doth speed,  The aspe doth on his feeder feed;  Fall yet triumphant in thy woe,  Bound with the entrails of thy foe.

  Have you not seen a charact<82.
2> lie  A great cathedral in the sea,  Under whose Babylonian walls  A small thin frigot almshouse stalls?  So in his slime the toad doth float  And th' spyder by, but seems his boat.
  And now the naumachie<82.
3> begins;  Close to the surface her self spins:  Arachne, when her foe lets flye  A broad-side of his breath too high,  That's over-shot, the wisely-stout,  Advised maid doth tack about;  And now her pitchy barque doth sweat,  Chaf'd in her own black fury wet;  Lasie and cold before, she brings  New fires to her contracted stings,  And with discolour'd spumes doth blast  The herbs that to their center hast.
  Now to the neighb'ring henbane top  Arachne hath her self wound up,  And thence, from its dilated leaves,  By her own cordage downwards weaves,  And doth her town of foe attack,<82.
4>  And storms the rampiers<82.
5> of his back;  Which taken in her colours spread,  March to th' citadel of's head.
  Now as in witty torturing Spain,  The brain is vext to vex the brain,  Where hereticks bare heads are arm'd  In a close helm, and in it charm'd  An overgrown and meagre rat,  That peece-meal nibbles himself fat;  So on the toads blew-checquer'd scull  The spider gluttons her self full.
  And vomiting her Stygian seeds,  Her poyson on his poyson feeds.
  Thus the invenom'd toad, now grown  Big with more poyson than his own,  Doth gather all his pow'rs, and shakes  His stormer in's disgorged lakes;  And wounded now, apace crawls on  To his next plantane surgeon,<82.
6>  With whose rich balm no sooner drest,  But purged is his sick swoln breast;  And as a glorious combatant,  That only rests awhile to pant,  Then with repeated strength and scars,  That smarting fire him new to wars,  Deals blows that thick themselves prevent,  As they would gain the time he spent.
      So the disdaining angry toad,  That calls but a thin useless load,  His fatal feared self comes back  With unknown venome fill'd to crack.
  Th' amased spider, now untwin'd,  Hath crept up, and her self new lin'd  With fresh salt foams and mists, that blast  The ambient air as they past.
  And now me thinks a Sphynx's wing  I pluck, and do not write, but sting;  With their black blood my pale inks blent,<82.
7>  Gall's but a faint ingredient.
  The pol'tick toad doth now withdraw,  Warn'd, higher in CAMPANIA.
<82.
8>  There wisely doth, intrenched deep,  His body in a body keep,  And leaves a wide and open pass  T' invite the foe up to his jaws,  Which there within a foggy blind  With fourscore fire-arms were lin'd.
  The gen'rous active spider doubts  More ambuscadoes than redoubts;  So within shot she doth pickear,<82.
9>  Now gall's the flank, and now the rear;  As that<82.
10> the toad in's own dispite  Must change the manner of his fight,  Who, like a glorious general,  With one home-charge lets fly at all.
  Chaf'd with a fourfold ven'mous foam  Of scorn, revenge, his foes and 's own,  He seats him in his loathed chair,  New-made him by each mornings air,  With glowing eyes he doth survey  Th' undaunted hoast he calls his prey;  Then his dark spume he gred'ly laps,  And shows the foe his grave, his chaps.
      Whilst the quick wary Amazon  Of 'vantage takes occasion,  And with her troop of leggs carreers  In a full speed with all her speers.
  Down (as some mountain on a mouse)  On her small cot he flings his house;  Without the poyson of the elf,  The toad had like t' have burst himself:  For sage Arachne with good heed  Had stopt herself upon full speed,  And, 's body now disorder'd, on  She falls to execution.
  The passive toad now only can  Contemn and suffer.
  Here began  The wronged maids ingenious rage,  Which his heart venome must asswage.
  One eye she hath spet out, strange smother,  When one flame doth put out another,  And one eye wittily spar'd, that he  Might but behold his miserie.
  She on each spot a wound doth print,  And each speck hath a sting within't;  Till he but one new blister is,  And swells his own periphrasis.
  Then fainting, sick, and yellow-pale,  She baths him with her sulph'rous stale;  Thus slacked is her Stygian fire,  And she vouchsafes now to retire.
  Anon the toad begins to pant,  Bethinks him of th' almighty plant,  And lest he peece-meal should be sped,  Wisely doth finish himself dead.
  Whilst the gay girl, as was her fate,  Doth wanton and luxuriate,  And crowns her conqu'ring head all or  With fatal leaves of hellebore.
  Not guessing at the pretious aid  Was lent her by the heavenly maid.
  The neer expiring toad now rowls  Himself in lazy bloody scrowls,  To th' sov'raign salve of all his ills,  That only life and health distills.
  But loe! a terror above all,  That ever yet did him befall!      Pallas, still mindful of her foe,  (Whilst they did with each fires glow)  Had to the place the spiders lar  Dispath'd before the ev'nings star.
  He learned was in Natures laws,  Of all her foliage knew the cause,  And 'mongst the rest in his choice want  Unplanted had this plantane plant.
      The all-confounded toad doth see  His life fled with his remedie,  And in a glorious despair  First burst himself, and next the air;  Then with a dismal horred yell  Beats down his loathsome breath to hell.
      But what inestimable bliss  This to the sated virgin is,  Who, as before of her fiend foe,  Now full is of her goddess too!  She from her fertile womb hath spun  Her stateliest pavillion,  Whilst all her silken flags display,  And her triumphant banners play;  Where Pallas she ith' midst doth praise,  And counterfeits her brothers rayes,  Nor will she her dear lar forget,  Victorious by his benefit,  Whose roof inchanted she doth free  From haunting gnat and goblin bee,  Who, trapp'd in her prepared toyle,  To their destruction keep a coyle.
      Then she unlocks the toad's dire head,  Within whose cell is treasured  That pretious stone, which she doth call  A noble recompence for all,  And to her lar doth it present,  Of his fair aid a monument.

  A figure now trianglare,  An oval now, and now a square,  And then a serpentine, dost crawl,  Now a straight line, now crook'd, now all.

      Thou, thine own daughter, then, and sire,  That son and mother art intire,  That big still with thy self dost go,  And liv'st an aged embrio;  That like the cubbs of India,  Thou from thy self a while dost play;  But frighted with a dog or gun,  In thine own belly thou dost run,  And as thy house was thine own womb,  So thine own womb concludes thy tomb.
      But now I must (analys'd king)  Thy oeconomick virtues sing;  Thou great stay'd husband still within,  Thou thee that's thine dost discipline;  And when thou art to progress bent,  Thou mov'st thy self and tenement,  As warlike Scythians travayl'd, you  Remove your men and city too;  Then, after a sad dearth and rain,  Thou scatterest thy silver train;  And when the trees grow nak'd and old,  Thou cloathest them with cloth of gold,  Which from thy bowels thou dost spin,  And draw from the rich mines within.
      Now hast thou chang'd thee, saint, and made  Thy self a fane that's cupula'd;  And in thy wreathed cloister thou  Walkest thine own gray fryer too;  Strickt and lock'd up, th'art hood all ore,  And ne'r eliminat'st thy dore.
  On sallads thou dost feed severe,  And 'stead of beads thou drop'st a tear,  And when to rest each calls the bell,  Thou sleep'st within thy marble cell,  Where, in dark contemplation plac'd,  The sweets of Nature thou dost tast,  Who now with time thy days resolve,  And in a jelly thee dissolve,  Like a shot star, which doth repair  Upward, and rarifie the air.

              THE TRIUMPHS OF PHILAMORE AND AMORET.
     TO THE NOBLEST OF OUR YOUTH AND BEST OF FRIENDS,            CHARLES COTTON, Esquire.
<85.
l>    BEING AT BERISFORD, AT HIS HOUSE IN STAFFORDSHIRE.
                    FROM LONDON.
                         A POEM.
      Sir, your sad absence I complain, as earth  Her long-hid spring, that gave her verdures birth,  Who now her cheerful aromatick head  Shrinks in her cold and dismal widow'd bed;  Whilst the false sun her lover doth him move  Below, and to th' antipodes make love.
      What fate was mine, when in mine obscure cave  (Shut up almost close prisoner in a grave)  Your beams could reach me through this vault of night,  And canton the dark dungeon with light!  Whence me (as gen'rous Spahys) you unbound,  Whilst I now know my self both free and crown'd.
      But as at Meccha's tombe, the devout blind  Pilgrim (great husband of his sight and mind)  Pays to no other object this chast prise,  Then with hot earth anoynts out both his eyes:  So having seen your dazling glories store,  It is enough, and sin for to see more.
      Or, do you thus those pretious rayes withdraw  To whet my dull beams, keep my bold in aw?  Or, are you gentle and compassionate,  You will not reach me Regulus his fate?  Brave prince! who, eagle-ey'd of eagle kind,  Wert blindly damn'd to look thine own self blind!      But oh, return those fires, too cruel-nice!  For whilst you fear me cindars, see, I'm ice!  A nummed speaking clod and mine own show,<85.
2>  My self congeal'd, a man cut out in snow:  Return those living fires.
  Thou, who that vast  Double advantage from one-ey'd Heav'n hast,  Look with one sun, though 't but obliquely be,  And if not shine, vouchsafe to wink on me.
      Perceive you not a gentle, gliding heat,  And quick'ning warmth, that makes the statua sweat;  As rev'rend Ducaleon's black-flung stone,  Whose rough outside softens to skin, anon  Each crusty vein with wet red is suppli'd,  Whilst nought of stone but in its heart doth 'bide.
      So from the rugged north, where your soft stay  Hath stampt them a meridian and kind day;  Where now each A LA MODE inhabitant  Himself and 's manners both do pay you rent,  And 'bout your house (your pallace) doth resort,  And 'spite of fate and war creates a court.
      So from the taught north, when you shall return,  To glad those looks that ever since did mourn,  When men uncloathed of themselves you'l see,  Then start new made, fit, what they ought to be;  Hast! hast! you, that your eyes on rare sights feed:  For thus the golden triumph is decreed.
      The twice-born god, still gay and ever young,  With ivie crown'd, first leads the glorious throng:  He Ariadne's starry coronet  Designs for th' brighter beams of Amoret;  Then doth he broach his throne, and singing quaff  Unto her health his pipe of god-head off.
      Him follow the recanting, vexing Nine  Who, wise, now sing thy lasting fame in wine;  Whilst Phoebus, not from th' east, your feast t' adorn,  But from th' inspir'd Canaries, rose this morn.
      Now you are come, winds in their caverns sit,  And nothing breaths, but new-inlarged wit.
  Hark!  One proclaims it piacle<85.
3> to be sad,  And th' people call 't religion to be mad.
      But now, as at a coronation,  When noyse, the guard, and trumpets are oreblown,  The silent commons mark their princes way,  And with still reverence both look and pray;  So they amaz'd expecting do adore,  And count the rest but pageantry before.
      Behold! an hoast of virgins, pure as th' air  In her first face,<85.
4> ere mists durst vayl her hair:  Their snowy vests, white as their whiter skin,  Or their far chaster whiter thoughts within:  Roses they breath'd and strew'd, as if the fine  Heaven did to earth his wreath of swets resign;  They sang aloud: "THRICE, OH THRICE HAPPY, THEY  THAT CAN, LIKE THESE, IN LOVE BOTH YIELD AND SWAY.
"      Next herald Fame (a purple clowd her bears),  In an imbroider'd coat of eyes and ears,  Proclaims the triumph, and these lovers glory,  Then in a book of steel records the story.
      And now a youth of more than god-like form  Did th' inward minds of the dumb throng alarm;  All nak'd, each part betray'd unto the eye,  Chastly: for neither sex ow'd he or she.
  And this was heav'nly love.
  By his bright hand,  A boy of worse than earthly stuff did stand;  His bow broke, his fires out, and his wings clipt,  And the black slave from all his false flames stript;  Whose eyes were new-restor'd but to confesse  This day's bright blisse, and his own wretchednesse;  Who, swell'd with envy, bursting with disdain,  Did cry to cry, and weep them out again.
      And now what heav'n must I invade, what sphere  Rifle of all her stars, t' inthrone her there?  No!  Phoebus, by thy boys<85.
5> fate we beware  Th' unruly flames o'th' firebrand, thy carr;  Although, she there once plac'd, thou, Sun, shouldst see  Thy day both nobler governed and thee.
  Drive on, Bootes, thy cold heavy wayn,  Then grease thy wheels with amber in the main,  And Neptune, thou to thy false Thetis gallop,  Appollo's set within thy bed of scallop:  Whilst Amoret, on the reconciled winds  Mounted, and drawn by six caelestial minds,  She armed was with innocence and fire,  That did not burn; for it was chast desire;  Whilst a new light doth gild the standers by.
  Behold! it was a day shot from her eye;  Chafing perfumes oth' East did throng and sweat,  But by her breath they melting back were beat.
  A crown of yet-nere-lighted stars she wore,  In her soft hand a bleeding heart she bore,  And round her lay of broken millions more;<85.
6>  Then a wing'd crier thrice aloud did call:  LET FAME PROCLAIM THIS ONE GREAT PRISE FOR ALL.
      By her a lady that might be call'd fair,  And justly, but that Amoret was there,  Was pris'ner led; th' unvalewed robe she wore  Made infinite lay lovers to adore,  Who vainly tempt her rescue (madly bold)  Chained in sixteen thousand links of gold;  Chrysetta thus (loaden with treasures) slave  Did strow the pass with pearls, and her way pave.
      But loe! the glorious cause of all this high  True heav'nly state, brave Philamore, draws nigh,  Who, not himself, more seems himself to be,  And with a sacred extasie doth see!  Fix'd and unmov'd on 's pillars he doth stay,  And joy transforms him his own statua;  Nor hath he pow'r to breath [n]or strength to greet  The gentle offers of his Amoret,  Who now amaz'd at 's noble breast doth knock,  And with a kiss his gen'rous heart unlock;  Whilst she and the whole pomp doth enter there,  Whence her nor Time nor Fate shall ever tear.
  But whether am I hurl'd? ho! back! awake  From thy glad trance: to thine old sorrow take!  Thus, after view of all the Indies store,  The slave returns unto his chain and oar;  Thus poets, who all night in blest heav'ns dwell,  Are call'd next morn to their true living hell;  So I unthrifty, to myself untrue,  Rise cloath'd with real wants, 'cause wanting you,  And what substantial riches I possesse,  I must to these unvalued dreams confesse.
      But all our clowds shall be oreblown, when thee  In our horizon bright once more we see;  When thy dear presence shall our souls new-dress,  And spring an universal cheerfulnesse;  When we shall be orewhelm'd in joy, like they  That change their night for a vast half-year's day.
      Then shall the wretched few, that do repine,  See and recant their blasphemies in wine;  Then shall they grieve, that thought I've sung too free,  High and aloud of thy true worth and thee,  And their fowl heresies and lips submit  To th' all-forgiving breath of Amoret;  And me alone their angers object call,  That from my height so miserably did fall;  And crie out my invention thin and poor,  Who have said nought, since I could say no more.

                  ADVICE TO MY BEST BROTHER,           COLL: FRANCIS LOVELACE.
<86.
1>      Frank, wil't live unhandsomely? trust not too far  Thy self to waving seas: for what thy star,  Calculated by sure event, must be,  Look in the glassy-epithete,<86.
2> and see.
      Yet settle here your rest, and take your state,  And in calm halcyon's nest ev'n build your fate;  Prethee lye down securely, Frank, and keep  With as much no noyse the inconstant deep  As its inhabitants; nay, stedfast stand,  As if discover'd were a New-found-land,  Fit for plantation here.
  Dream, dream still,  Lull'd in Dione's cradle; dream, untill  Horrour awake your sense, and you now find  Your self a bubbled pastime for the wind;  And in loose Thetis blankets torn and tost.
  Frank, to undo thy self why art at cost?      Nor be too confident, fix'd on the shore:  For even that too borrows from the store  Of her rich neighbour, since now wisest know  (And this to Galileo's judgement ow),  The palsie earth it self is every jot  As frail, inconstant, waveing, as that blot  We lay upon the deep, that sometimes lies  Chang'd, you would think, with 's botoms properties;  But this eternal, strange Ixion's wheel  Of giddy earth ne'er whirling leaves to reel,  Till all things are inverted, till they are  Turn'd to that antick confus'd state they were.
      Who loves the golden mean, doth safely want  A cobwebb'd cot and wrongs entail'd upon't;  He richly needs a pallace for to breed  Vipers and moths, that on their feeder feed;  The toy that we (too true) a mistress call,  Whose looking-glass and feather weighs up all;  And cloaths which larks would play with in the sun,  That mock him in the night, when 's course is run.
      To rear an edifice by art so high,  That envy should not reach it with her eye,  Nay, with a thought come neer it.
  Wouldst thou know,  How such a structure should be raisd, build low.
  The blust'ring winds invisible rough stroak  More often shakes the stubborn'st, prop'rest oak;  And in proud turrets we behold withal,  'Tis the imperial top declines to fall:  Nor does Heav'n's lightning strike the humble vales,  But high-aspiring mounts batters and scales.
      A breast of proof defies all shocks of Fate,  Fears in the best, hopes in worser state;  Heaven forbid that, as of old, time ever  Flourish'd in spring so contrary, now never.
  That mighty breath, which blew foul Winter hither,  Can eas'ly puffe it to a fairer weather.
  Why dost despair then, Frank?  Aeolus has  A Zephyrus as well as Boreas.
      'Tis a false sequel, soloecisme 'gainst those  Precepts by fortune giv'n us, to suppose  That, 'cause it is now ill, 't will ere be so;  Apollo doth not always bend his bow;  But oft, uncrowned of his beams divine,  With his soft harp awakes the sleeping Nine.
      In strictest things magnanimous appear,  Greater in hope, howere thy fate, then<86.
3> fear:  Draw all your sails in quickly, though no storm  Threaten your ruine with a sad alarm;  For tell me how they differ, tell me, pray,  A cloudy tempest and a too fair day?    <86.

    Now, my best Lilly, let's walk hand in hand,  And smile at this un-understanding land;  Let them their own dull counterfeits adore,  Their rainbow-cloaths admire, and no more.

      Come then, pale virgins, roses strow,      Mingled with Ios as you go.
          The snowy ox is kill'd,  The fane with pros'lyte lads and lasses fill'd,  You too may hope the same seraphic joy,          Old time cannot destroy,              Nor fulnesse cloy;  When, like these, you shall stamp by sympathies  Thousands of new-born-loves with your chaste eyes.

1> Lovelace was connected with the Stanleys through the  Auchers.
  The Kentish families, about this time, intermarried  with each other to a very large extent, partly to indemnify  themselves from the consequences of gravelkind tenure (though  many had procured parliamentary relief); and the Lovelaces,  the Stanleys, the Hammonds, the Sandyses, were all more or less  bound together by the ties of kindred.
  See the tree prefixed  by Sir Egerton Brydges to his edition of HAMMOND'S POEMS, 1816,  and the Introduction to STANLEY'S POEMS, 1814.
  Sir William  Lovelace, the poet's grandfather, married Elizabeth, daughter  of Edward Aucher, Esq.
, of Bishopsbourne, near Canterbury, while  Sir William Hammond, of St.
 Alban's Court, married, as his second  wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Anthony Aucher, Esq.
, of  Bishopsbourne, by whom he had, among other children, Mary,  who became the wife of Sir Thomas Stanley, of Cumberlow, father of  Thomas Stanley, the poet, historian, and translator of Bion, &c.
    <89.
2> See THE POEMS OF WILLIAM HAMMOND, 1655, edited by  Sir E.
 Brydges, 1816, p.
 54, where there is a similar poem  on Stanley and his bride from the pen of Hammond, who also claimed  relationship with the then newly-married poet.

    Rome to her bard, who did her battails sing,  Indifferent gave to poet and to king;  With the same lawrells were his temples fraught,  Who best had written, and who best had fought;  The self same fame they equally did feel,  One's style ador'd as much as t' other's steel.
  A chain or fasces she could then afford  The sons of Phoebus, we, an axe or cord;  Sometimes a coronet was her renown,  And ours, the dear prerogative of a crown.
  In marble statu'd walks great Lucan lay,  And now we walk, our own pale statua.

  There is a creature, (if I may so call  That unto which they do all prostrate fall)  Term'd mistress, when they'r angry; but, pleas'd high,  It is a princesse, saint, divinity.
  To this they sacrifice the whole days light,  Then lye with their devotion all night;  For this you are to dive to the abysse,  And rob for pearl the closet of some fish.
  Arabia and Sabaea you must strip  Of all their sweets, for to supply her lip;  And steal new fire from heav'n, for to repair  Her unfledg'd scalp with Berenice's hair;  Then seat her in Cassiopeia's chair.

  Like to the golden tripod, it did pass  From this to this, till 't came to him, whose 'twas.

  A mercer now by th' yard does measure ore  An ode, which was but by the foot before;  Deals you an ell of epigram, and swears  It is the strongest and the finest wears.
  No wonder, if a drawer verses rack,  If 'tis not his, 't may be the spir't of sack;  Whilst the fair bar-maid stroaks the muses teat,  For milk to make the posset up compleat.

  How would thy masc'line spirit, father Ben,  Sweat to behold basely deposed men,  Justled from the prerog'tive of their bed,  Whilst wives are per'wig'd with their husbands head?  Each snatches the male quill from his faint hand,  And must both nobler write and understand,  He to her fury the soft plume doth bow:  O pen, nere truely justly slit till now!  Now as her self a poem she doth dresse.
  And curls a line, as she would do a tresse;  Powders a sonnet as she does her hair,  Then prostitutes them both to publick aire.
  Nor is 't enough, that they their faces blind  With a false dye; but they must paint their mind,  In meeter scold, and in scann'd order brawl,  Yet there's one Sapho<90.

    But now let me recal my passion.
  Oh! (from a noble father, nobler son)  You, that alone are the Clarissimi,  And the whole gen'rous state of Venice be,  It shall not be recorded Sanazar  Shall boast inthron'd alone this new made star;  You, whose correcting sweetnesse hath forbad  Shame to the good, and glory to the bad;  Whose honour hath ev'n into vertue tam'd  These swarms, that now so angerly I nam'd.
  Forgive what thus distemper'd I indite:  For it is hard a SATYRE not to write.
  Yet, as a virgin that heats all her blood  At the first motion of bad<90.
27> understood,  Then, at meer thought of fair chastity,  Straight cools again the tempests of her sea:    So when to you I my devotions raise,    All wrath and storms do end in calm and praise.

  See  MERY TALES AND QUICKE ANSWERS, No.
 23 (ed.
 Hazlitt).
  I fear  that if Lovelace had derived his knowledge of this incident  <f>rom the little work mentioned, he would have been still more  sarcastic; for Louis, in the TALES AND QUICKE ANSWERS, is made  to give, not 500 crowns for a turnip, but 1000 crowns for a radish.
    <90.
2> Perhaps Lovelace is rather too severe on Sannazaro.
  That  writer is said to have occupied twenty years in the composition  of his poem on the Birth of the Saviour, for which he probably  did not receive a sixth part of the sum paid to him for his  hexastic on Venice; and so he deserved this little windfal, which  came out of the pocket of a Government rich enough to pay it ten  times over.
  See Corniano's VITA DI JACOPO SANNAZARO, prefixed to  the edition of his ARCADIA, published at Milan in 1806.
  Amongst  the translations printed at the end of LUCASTA, and which it seems  very likely were among the earliest poetical essays of Lovelace,  is this very epigram of Sannazaro.
  As in the case of THE ANT,  I have little doubt that the satire was suggested by the  translation.

  Few readers require to be told  that anagrams and acrostics were formerly one of the most  fashionable species of composition.
  Lovelace here pictures  a poetaster "stewing" his brains with a poem of this description,  which of course demanded a certain amount of tedious and minute  attention to the arrangement of the name of the individual  to whom the anagram or acrostic was to be addressed, and this  was especially the case, where the writer contemplated  a DOUBLE acrostic.

 E[LDRED] R[EVETT].
<91.
1>             ON HIS POEMS MORAL AND DIVINE.
      Cleft as the top of the inspired hill,  Struggles the soul of my divided quill,  Whilst this foot doth the watry mount aspire,  That Sinai's living and enlivening fire,  Behold my powers storm'd by a twisted light  O' th' Sun and his, first kindled his sight,  And my lost thoughts invoke the prince of day,  My right to th' spring of it and him do pray.
      Say, happy youth, crown'd with a heav'nly ray  Of the first flame, and interwreathed bay,  Inform my soul in labour to begin,  Ios or Anthems, Poeans or a Hymne.
  Shall I a hecatombe on thy tripod slay,  Or my devotions at thy altar pay?  While which t' adore th' amaz'd world cannot tell,  The sublime Urim or deep oracle.
      Heark! how the moving chords temper our brain,  As when Apollo serenades the main,  Old Ocean smooths his sullen furrow'd front,  And Nereids do glide soft measures on't;  Whilst th' air puts on its sleekest, smoothest face,  And each doth turn the others looking-glasse;  So by the sinewy lyre now strook we see  Into soft calms all storm of poesie,  And former thundering and lightning lines,  And verse now in its native lustre shines.
      How wert thou hid within thyself! how shut!  Thy pretious Iliads lock'd up in a nut!  Not hearing of thee thou dost break out strong,  Invading forty thousand men in song;  And we, secure in our thin empty heat,  Now find ourselves at once surprised and beat,  Whilst the most valiant of our wits now sue,  Fling down their arms, ask quarter too of you.
      So cabin'd up in its disguis'd coarse<91.
2> rust,  And scurf'd all ore with its unseemly crust,  The diamond, from 'midst the humbler stones,  Sparkling shoots forth the price of nations.
    Ye safe unriddlers of the stars, pray tell,  By what name shall I stamp my miracle?  Thou strange inverted Aeson, that leap'st ore  From thy first infancy into fourscore,  That to thine own self hast the midwife play'd,  And from thy brain spring'st forth<91.
3> the heav'nly maid!  Thou staffe of him bore<91.
4> him, that bore our sins,  Which, but set down, to bloom and bear begins!  Thou rod of Aaron, with one motion hurl'd,  Bud'st<91.
5> a perfume of flowers through the world!  You<91.
6> strange calcined<91.
7> seeds within a glass,  Each species Idaea spring'st as 'twas!  Bright vestal flame that, kindled but ev'n now,  For ever dost thy sacred fires throw!      Thus the repeated acts of Nestor's age,  That now had three times ore out-liv'd the stage,  And all those beams contracted into one,  Alcides in his cradle hath outdone.
      But all these flour'shing hiews, with which I die  Thy virgin paper, now are vain as I:  For 'bove the poets Heav'n th' art taught to shine  And move, as in thy proper crystalline;  Whence that mole-hill Parnassus thou dost view,  And us small ants there dabbling in its dew;  Whence thy seraphic soul such hymns doth play,  As those to which first danced the first day,  Where with a thorn from the world-ransoming wreath  Thou stung, dost antiphons and anthems breathe;  Where with an Angels quil dip'd i' th' Lambs blood,  Thou sing'st our Pelicans all-saving flood,  And bath'st thy thoughts in ever-living streams,  Rench'd<91.
8> from earth's tainted, fat and heavy steams.
  There move translated youth inroll'd i' th' quire,  That only doth with wholy lays inspire;  To whom his burning coach Eliah sent,  And th' royal prophet-priest his harp hath lent;  Which thou dost tune in consort unto those  Clap wings for ever at each hallow'd close:  Whilst we, now weak and fainting in our praise,  Sick echo ore thy Halleluiahs.

          ON THE BEST, LAST, AND ONLY REMAINING COMEDY                 OF MR.
 FLETCHER.
               THE WILD GOOSE CHASE.
<92.
1>      I'm un-ore-clowded, too! free from the mist!  The blind and late Heaven's-eyes great Occulist,  Obscured with the false fires of his sceme,  Not half those souls are lightned by this theme.
      Unhappy murmurers, that still repine  (After th' Eclipse our Sun doth brighter shine),  Recant your false grief, and your true joys know;  Your blisse is endlesse, as you fear'd your woe!  What fort'nate flood is this! what storm of wit!  Oh, who would live, and not ore-whelm'd in it?  No more a fatal Deluge shall be hurl'd:  This inundation hath sav'd the world.
  Once more the mighty Fletcher doth arise,  Roab'd in a vest studded with stars and eyes  Of all his former glories; his last worth  Imbroiderd with what yet light ere brought forth.
  See! in this glad farewel he doth appear  Stuck with the Constellations of his Sphere,  Fearing we numb'd fear'd no flagration,  Hath curl'd all his fires in this one ONE:  Which (as they guard his hallowed chast urn)  The dull aproaching hereticks do burn.
      Fletcher at his adieu carouses thus  To the luxurious ingenious,  As Cleopatra did of old out-vie,  Th' un-numb'red dishes of her Anthony,  When (he at th' empty board a wonderer)  Smiling she<92.
2> calls for pearl and vinegar,  First pledges him in's BREATH, then at one draught  Swallows THREE KINGDOMS of To HIS BEST THOUGHT.
      Hear, oh ye valiant writers, and subscribe;  (His force set by) y'are conquer'd by this bribe.
  Though you hold out your selves, he doth commit  In this a sacred treason in your wit;  Although in poems desperately stout,  Give up: this overture must buy you out.
      Thus with some prodigal us'rer 't doth fare,  That keeps his gold still vayl'd, his steel-breast bare;  That doth exceed his coffers all but's eye,  And his eyes' idol the wing'd Deity:  That cannot lock his mines with half the art  As some rich beauty doth his wretched heart;  Wild at his real poverty, and so wise  To win her, turns himself into a prise.
  First startles her with th' emerald Mad-Lover<92.
3>  The ruby Arcas,<92.
4> least she should recover  Her dazled thought, a Diamond he throws,  Splendid in all the bright Aspatia's woes;<92.
5>  Then to sum up the abstract of his store,  He flings a rope of Pearl of forty<92.
6> more.
  Ah, see! the stagg'ring virtue faints! which he  Beholding, darts his Wealths Epitome;<92.
7>  And now, to consummate her wished fall,  Shows this one Carbuncle, that darkens all.

2> that I  Stick on thy hearse this sprig of Elegie:  Nor that your soul so fast was link'd in me,  That now I've both, since't has forsaken thee:  That thus I stand a Swisse before thy gate,  And dare, for such another, time and fate.
  Alas! our faiths made different essays,  Our Minds and Merits brake two several ways;  Justice commands I wake thy learned dust,  And truth, in whom all causes center must.

  So that fair Cam saw thee matriculate,  At once a tyro and a graduate.
      At nineteen, what ESSAYES<95.

  What shall I say? by what allusion bold?  NONE BUT THE SUN WAS ERE SO YOUNG AND OLD.
      Young reverend shade, ascend awhile! whilst we  Now celebrate this posthume victorie,  This victory, that doth contract in death  Ev'n all the pow'rs and labours of thy breath.

  These soveraign leaves thou left'st us are become  Sear clothes against all Times infection.
      Sacred Hierocles, whose heav'nly thought  First acted ore this comment, ere it wrote,<95.
11>  Thou hast so spirited, elixir'd, we  Conceive there is a noble alchymie,  That's turning of this gold to something more  Pretious than gold, we never knew before.
  Who now shall doubt the metempsychosis  Of the great Author, that shall peruse this?  Let others dream thy shadow wandering strays  In th' Elizian mazes hid with bays;  Or that, snatcht up in th' upper region,  'Tis kindled there a constellation;  I have inform'd me, and declare with ease  THY SOUL IS FLED INTO HIEROCLES.

    No one can boast her self so much belov'd,  Truely as Lesbia my affections prov'd;  No faith was ere with such a firm knot bound,  As in my love on my part I have found.

<108.
1>      To pay my love to thee, and pay it so,  As honest men should what they justly owe,  Were to write better of thy life, then can  The assured'st pen of the most worthy man.
  Such was thy composition, such thy mind,  Improv'd from vertue, and from vice refin'd;  Thy youth an abstract of the world's best parts,  Invr'd to arms and exercis'd to arts,  Which, with the vigour of a man, became  Thine and thy countries piramids of fame.
  Two glorious lights to guide our hopeful youth  Into the paths of honour and of truth.
    These parts (so rarely met) made up in thee,  What man should in his full perfection be:  So sweet a temper into every sence  And each affection breath'd an influence,  As smooth'd them to a calme, which still withstood  The ruffling passions of untamed blood,  Without a wrinckle in thy face, to show  Thy stable breast could a<108.
2> disturbance know.
  In fortune humble, constant in mischance;  Expert in both, and both serv'd to advance  Thy name by various trialls of thy spirit,  And give the testimony of thy merit.
  Valiant to envy of the bravest men,  And learned to an undisputed pen;  Good as the best in both and great, but yet  No dangerous courage nor offensive wit.
  These ever serv'd the one for to defend,  The other, nobly to advance thy friend,  Under which title I have found my name  Fix'd in the living chronicle of fame  To times succeeding: yet I hence must go,  Displeas'd I cannot celebrate thee so.
  But what respect, acknowledgement and love,  What these together, when improv'd, improve:  Call it by any name (so it express  Ought like a tribute to thy worthyness,  And may my bounden gratitude become)  LOVELACE, I offer at thy honour'd tomb.
    And though thy vertues many friends have bred  To love thee liveing, and lament thee dead,  In characters far better couch'd then these,  Mine will not blott thy fame, nor theirs encrease.
  'Twas by thine own great merits rais'd so high,  That, maugre time and fate, it shall not dye.
                                 Sic flevit.

                                 AN ELEGIE,        SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF MY LATE HONOURED FRIEND,              COLLONELL RICHARD LOVELACE.
      Pardon (blest shade), that I thus crowd to be  'Mong those that sin unto thy memory,  And that I think unvalu'd reliques spread,  And am the first that pillages the dead;  Since who would be thy mourner as befits,  But an officious sacriledge commits.
  How my tears strive to do thee fairer right,  And from the characters divide my sight.
  Untill it (dimmer) a new torrent swells,  And what obscur'd it, falls my spectacles    Let the luxurious floods impulsive rise,  As they would not be wept, but weep the eyes,  The while earth melts, and we above it lye  But the weak bubbles of mortalitie;  Until our griefs are drawn up by the Sun,  And that (too) drop the exhalation.
  How in thy dust we humble now our pride,  And bring thee a whole people mortifi'd!  For who expects not death, now thou art gone,  Shows his low folly, not religion.
    Can the poetick heaven still hold on  The golden dance, when the first mover's gon?  And the snatch'd fires (which circularly hurl'd)  In their strong rapture glimmer to the world,  And not stupendiously rather rise  The tapers unto these solemnities?    Can the chords move in tune, when thou dost dye,  At once their universal harmony?  But where Apollo's harp (with murmur) laid,  Had to the stones a melody convey'd,  They by some pebble summon'd would reply  In loud results to every battery;  Thus do we come unto thy marble room,  To eccho from the musick of thy tombe.
    May we dare speak thee dead, that wouldest be  In thy remove only not such as we?  No wonder, the advance is from us hid;  Earth could not lift thee higher then it did!  And thou, that didst grow up so ever nigh,  Art but now gone to immortality!  So near to where thou art, thou here didst dwell,  The change to thee is less perceptible.
    Thy but unably-comprehending clay,  To what could not be circumscrib'd, gave way,  And the more spacious tennant to return,  Crack'd (in the two restrain'd estate) its urn.
  That is but left to a successive trust;  The soul's first buried in his bodies dust.
    Thou more thy self, now thou art less confin'd,  Art not concern'd in what is left behind;  While we sustain the losse that thou art gone,  Un-essenc'd in the separation;  And he that weeps thy funerall, in one  Is pious to the widdow'd nation.
    And under what (now) covert must I sing,  Secure as if beneath a cherub's wing;  When thou hast tane thy flight hence, and art nigh  In place to some related hierarchie,  Where a bright wreath of glories doth but set  Upon thy head an equal coronet;  And thou, above our humble converse gon,  Canst but be reach'd by contemplation.
    Our lutes (as thine was touch'd) were vocall by,  And thence receiv'd the soul by sympathy,  That did above the threds inspiring creep,  And with soft whispers broke the am'rous sleep;  Which now no more (mov'd with the sweet surprise)  Awake into delicious rapsodies;  But with their silent mistress do comply,  And fast in undisturbed slumbers lye.
    How from thy first ascent thou didst disperse  A blushing warmth throughout the universe,  While near the morns Lucasta's fires did glow,  And to the earth a purer dawn did throw.
  We ever saw thee in the roll of fame  Advancing thy already deathless name;  And though it could but be above its fate,  Thou would'st, however, super-errogate.
    Now as in Venice, when the wanton State  Before a Spaniard spread their crowded plate,  He made it the sage business of his eye  To find the root of the wild treasury;  So learn't from that exchequer but the more  To rate his masters vegetable ore.
  Thus when the Greek and Latin muse we read,  As but the<110.
1> cold inscriptions of the dead,  We to advantage then admired thee,  Who did'st live on still with thy poesie;  And in our proud enjoyments never knew  The end of the unruly wealth that grew.
  But now we have the last dear ingots gain'd,  And the free vein (however rich) is drein'd;  Though what thou hast bequeathed us, no space  Of this worlds span of time shall ere embrace.
  But as who sometimes knew not to conclude  Upon the waters strange vicissitude,  Did to the ocean himself commit,  That it might comprehend what could not it,  So we in our endeavours must out-done  Be swallowed up within thy Helicon.
    Thou, who<110.
2> art layd up in thy precious cave,  And from the hollow spaces of thy grave,  We still may mourn in tune, but must alone  Hereafter hope to quaver out a grone;  No more the chirping sonnets with shrill notes  Must henceforth volley from our treble throtes;  But each sad accent must be humour'd well  To the deep solemn organ of thy cell.
    Why should some rude hand carve thy sacred stone,  And there incise a cheap inscription?  When we can shed the tribute of our tears  So long, till the relenting marble wears;  Which shall such order in their cadence keep,  That they a native epitaph shall weep;  Untill each letter spelt distinctly lyes,  Cut by the mystick droppings of our eyes.

 appear to be lost, which, unless they were  far superior to the present specimen, cannot be regarded as  a great calamity.
                          AN ELEGIE.
    Me thinks, when kings, prophets, and poets dye,  We should not bid men weep, nor ask them why,  But the great loss should by instinct impair  The nations, like a pestilential ayr,  And in a moment men should feel the cramp  Of grief, like persons poyson'd with a damp.
  All things in nature should their death deplore,  And the sun look less lovely than before;  The fixed stars should change their constant spaces,  And comets cast abroad their flagrant<111.
1> faces.
  Yet still we see princes and poets fall  Without their proper pomp of funerall;  Men look about, as if they nere had known  The poets lawrell or the princes crown;  Lovelace hath long been dead, and he<111.
2> can be  Oblig'd to no man for an elegie.
  Are you all turn'd to silence, or did he  Retain the only sap of poesie,  That kept all branches living? must his fall  Set an eternal period upon all?  So when a spring-tide doth begin to fly<111.
3>  From the green shoar, each neighbouring creek grows dry.
  But why do I so pettishly detract  An age that is so perfect, so exact?  In all things excellent, it is a fame  Or glory to deceased Lovelace name:  For he is weak in wit, who doth deprave  Anothers worth to make his own seem brave;  And this was not his aim: nor is it mine.
  I now conceive the scope of their designe,  Which is with one consent to bring and burn  Contributary incence on his urn,  Where each mans love and fancy shall be try'd,  As when great Johnson or brave Shakespear dyed.
  Wits must unite: for ignorance, we see,  Hath got a great train of artillerie:  Yet neither shall nor can it blast the fame  And honour of deceased Lovelace name,  Whose own LUCASTA can support his credit  Amongst all such who knowingly have read it;  But who that praise can by desert discusse  Due to those poems that are posthumous?  And if the last conceptions are the best,  Those by degrees do much transcend the rest;  So full, so fluent, that they richly sute  With Orpheus lire, or with Anacreons lute,  And he shall melt his wing, that shall aspire  To reach a fancy or one accent higher.
  Holland and France have known his nobler parts,  And found him excellent in arms and arts.
  To sum up all, few men of fame but know,  He was TAM MARTI, QUAM MERCURIO.

 DUDLEY LOVELACE  UPON HIS EDITION OF HIS BROTHERS POEMS.
      Thy pious hand, planting fraternal bayes,  Deserving is of most egregious praise;  Since 'tis the organ doth to us convey  From a descended sun so bright a ray.
  Clear spirit! how much we are bound to thee  For this so great a liberalitie,  The truer worth of which by much exceeds  The western wealth, which such contention breeds!  Like the Infusing-God, from the well-head  Of poesie you have besprinkled  Our brows with holy drops, the very last,  Which from your Brother's happy pen were cast:  Yet as the last, the best; such matchlesse skill  From his divine alembick did distill.
  Your honour'd Brother in the Elyzian shade  Will joy to know himself a laureat made  By your religious care, and that his urn  Doth him on earth immortal life return.
  Your self you have a good physician shown  To his much grieved friends and to your own,  In giving this elixir'd medecine,  For greatest grief a soveraign anodine.
    Sir, from your Brother y' have convey'd us bliss;  Now, since your genius so concurs with his,  Let your own quill our next enjoyments frame;  All must be rich, that's grac'd with Lovelace name.

                           ELEGIE.
    Great son of Mars, and of Minerva too!  With what oblations must we come to woo  Thy sacred soul to look down from above,  And see how much thy memory we love,  Whose happy pen so pleased amorous ears,  And, lifting bright LUCASTA to the sphears,  Her in the star-bespangled orb did set  Above fair Ariadnes coronet,  Leaving a pattern to succeeding wits,  By which to sing forth their Pythonick fits.
  Shall we bring tears and sighs? no, no! then we  Should but bemone our selves for loosing thee,  Or else thy happiness seem to deny,  Or to repine at thy felicity.
  Then, whilst we chant out thine immortal praise,  Our offerings shall be onely sprigs of bays;  And if our tears will needs their brinks out-fly,  We'l weep them forth into an elegy,  To tell the world, how deep fates wounded wit,  When Atropos the lovely Lovelace hit!  How th' active fire, which cloath'd thy gen'rous mind,  Consum'd the water, and the earth calcin'd  Untill a stronger heat by death was given,  Which sublimated thy poor soul to heaven.
  Thou knew'st right well to guide the warlike steed,  And yet could'st court the Muses with full speed  And such success, that the inspiring Nine  Have fill'd their Thespian fountain so with brine.
  Henceforth we can expect no lyrick lay,  But biting satyres through the world must stray.
  Bellona joyns with fair Erato too,  And with the Destinies do keep adoe,  Whom thus she queries: could not you awhile  Reprieve his life, until another file  Of poems such as these had been drawn up?  The fates reply'd that thou wert taken up,  A sacrifice unto the deities;  Since things most perfect please their holy eyes,  And that no other victim could be found  With so much learning and true virtue crown'd.
  Since it is so, in peace for ever rest;  Tis very just that God should have the best.

                        ON MY BROTHER.
    Lovelace is dead! then let the world return  To its first chaos, mufled in its urn;  The stars and elements together lye,  Drench'd in perpetual obscurity,  And the whole machine in confusion be,  As immethodick as an anarchie.
  May the great eye of day weep out his light,  Pale Cynthia leave the regiment of night,  The galaxia, all in sables dight,  Send forth no corruscations to our sight,  The Sister-Graces and the sacred Nine,  Statu'd with grief, attend upon his shrine,  Whose worth, whose loss, should we but truly rate,  'Twould puzzle our arithmetic to state  Th' accompt of vertu's so transcendent high,  Number and value reach infinity.
  Did I pronounce him dead! no, no! he lives,  And from his aromatique cell he gives  Spice-breathed fumes, whose odoriferous scent  (In zephre-gales which never can be spent)  Doth spread it self abroad, and much out-vies  The eastern bird in her self-sacrifice;  Or Father Phoebus, who to th' world derives  Such various and such multiformed lives,  Took notice that brave Lovelace did inspire  The universe with his Promethean fire,  And snatcht him hence, before his thread was spun,  En'ving that here should be another Sun.

                 EPITAPH.
    Tread (reader) gently, gently ore  The happy dust beneath this floor:  For in this narrow vault is set  An alablaster cabinet,  Wherein both arts and arms were put,  Like Homers Iliads in a nut,  Till Death with slow and easie pace  Snatcht the bright jewell from the case;  And now, transform'd, he doth arise  A constellation in the skies,  Teaching the blinded world the way,  Through night, to startle into day:  And shipwrackt shades, with steady hand,  He steers unto th' Elizian land.

  The original printed book did not use this character at all.
    SQUARE BRACKETS:    The square brackets, i.

    FOOTNOTES:    For this E-Text version of the book, the footnotes have been  consolidated at the end of each section of the introduction,  and at the end of each poem.
    Numbering of the footnotes has been changed, and each footnote  is given a unique identity in the form <XX.
YY>, where XX is  a poem or a section of the introduction, and YY is the number  of the note within that poem or section.
    Some footnote markers are missing.
  I have inserted markers where  I believe they should go.
  All such markers are identified by  double brackets.
  e.
g.
 <<9.

  These footnotes  have been identified as <<AN.

  They  have been moved to the end of the appropriate sections of the  E-Text, and footnote markers, identified by double angle brackets,  i.
e.
 <<  >> have been added.
  The original locations of these  footnotes in the body text, however, are also indicated for  information.
    LATIN AND GREEK POEMS:    This E-Text contains some poems in Latin and in Greek.
    The Latin poems are reproduced as they appear in the book,  except that the accent marks have been deleted.
    The Greek poems were originally typeset in Greek characters.
  For this E-Text, the Greek characters have been TRANSLITERATED  into Roman characters, using a system developed for the  US Library of Congress, Ref.
         ALA-LC ROMANIZATION TABLES       TRANSLITERATION SCHEMES FOR NON-ROMAN SCRIPTS       Approved by the Library of Congress and the American Library            Association       Tables compiled and edited by Randall K.
 Barry       Network Development and MARC Standards Office       Library of Congress, Washington, 1991    Again, it was necessary to delete the accent marks, this time  accents which were recommended to be placed over the roman  characters.
  The Greek poems are set off by angle brackets.
    Single Greek words embedded in roman text have also been  transliterated, as described above, and are identified by  double angle brackets, e.
g.
 <<eulikrines>>    SPELLING:    I have made no spelling corrections whatsoever.
  In the poems,  the spelling is very inconsistent, with several different versions  of a word being used in different places    OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE TEXT:    In a few places, the capital 'V' and 'I' characters were used  where we would use a capital 'U' of 'J' instead.
  These have not  been changed.
 For example, Vnlese, Iuvenal.
  Where the capitals  in the original text were used to highlight the first word of  a poem, 'V' was changed to 'v', for example, OVR became Ovr.
    The copy of the book which I worked from had been re-bound on  several occasions.
  It is possible that the 'Table of Contents'  was originally placed after the introduction.
    CHANGES TO THE TEXT:    Symbols for British currency are changed to <pounds>, <shillings>,  and <pence>.
    In several places the word 'the' appears with an accent mark over  the 'e'.
  The accent is in the form of a horizontal line above  the letter.
  This word has been rendered as '<thee>'.
  Similarly  'whe' with an accent over the 'e' is rendered as '<whee>'.
